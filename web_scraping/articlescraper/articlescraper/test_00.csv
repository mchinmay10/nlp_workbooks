"<p>In the prodromal phase of schizophrenia, severe alterations of the visual appearance of the environment have been found, accompanied by a state of intense anxiety. The present study considers the possibility that these alterations really exist in the appearance of objects, but that healthy people do not see them. The image of the world that we see is continuously deformed and fragmented by foreshortenings, partial overlapping, and so on and must be constantly reassembled and interpreted; otherwise, it could change so much that we would hardly recognize it. Since pleasure has been found to be involved in visual and cognitive information processing, the possibility is considered that anhedonia (the reduction of the ability to feel pleasure) might interfere with the correct reconstruction and interpretation of the image of the environment and alter its appearance. The possibility is also considered that these alterations might make the environment hostile, might at times evoke the sensation of being trapped by a predator, and might be the cause of the anxiety that accompanies them. According to some authors, they might also induce delusional ideas, in an attempt to restore meaning in a world that has become chaotic and frightening. </p>"
"<p>The prodromal phase of schizophrenia refers to the early signs and symptoms that precede the clear manifestation of the illness. It begins when the first alterations of the mood or behavior are noticed and ends with the onset of frank psychotic symptoms [<a href=""#B1"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B1"">1</a>]. This period, which can last days, months, or years, is characterized by heterogeneous and nonspecific symptoms which may include, among others, depressive and anxious symptoms as well as attenuated psychotic symptoms [<a href=""#B1"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B1"">1</a>].</p>"
"<p>Towards the middle of the last century Conrad, director of the University Psychiatric Hospital in Göttingen, found that in the prodromal phase of schizophrenia severe alterations in the perception and organization of sensory information are present, accompanied by intense anxiety, and he expounded the theory that schizophrenia may be caused by a perceptual disorder and that the delusional ideas may be an attempt to give meaning to a world that has become incomprehensible on account of the perceptual disorder [<a href=""#B2"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B2"">2</a>]. Cutting and Dunne confirmed the frequency and the severity of disturbances of visual perception in the prodromal phase of schizophrenia. All the patients interviewed reported that at the beginning of the illness the shapes of objects appeared profoundly changed: “there is an undoubted and dramatic change in the way they [the patients] perceive the world” [<a href=""#B3"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B3"">3</a>, p. 230]. Their accounts agree with those supplied by Conrad's patients, for whom “familiar things, whose authenticity would never have been doubted, are not recognized, they are rejected as something extraneous or, at least, they appear to be singularly modified” [<a href=""#B2"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B2"">2</a>, p. 100]. According to Cutting and Dunne, the most plausible psychological theory concerning the cause of schizophrenia is a “break-down in Gestalt” [<a href=""#B3"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B3"">3</a>, p. 230]. (Gestalt in German means shape, form, but also, as in this case, the percept of something as a hole beyond its individual parts: a “minimum cohesive pattern” according to the definition of Muth et al. [<a href=""#B4"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B4"">4</a>, p. 1].)</p>"
"<p>Cutting sums up Conrad's thought as follows: “In the first phase, which he [Conrad] called the<em> trema</em>, because of the accompanying mood of terror, the ability to form a Gestalt is disintegrated” and in the next phase the patient “attaches new meanings to the change, and these new beliefs are what the observer calls delusions. Delusions, for Conrad, are not therefore abnormal in themselves, which is the traditional view of schizophrenia, from Jaspers onward. They are the normal responses of anyone whose perceptual world has been degraded in this dramatic way” [<a href=""#B5"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B5"">5</a>, p. 430].</p>"
"<p>In a research in 1966, Chapman confirmed Conrad's observations, both on the alterations of the appearance of the environment and on the presence of intense anxiety in the initial phase of schizophrenia, and considered anxiety a consequence of the visual alterations. The visual alterations that Chapman found consisted initially of changes of colour and contrast (contrast: difference in brightness or colour between various shapes), which could also be pleasant, but “as the breakdown in visual perception progresses, and as other disturbances in perceptions and cognitions develop, this early reaction changed to one of intense anxiety” [<a href=""#B6"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B6"">6</a>, p. 240].</p>"
"<p>The presence of anxiety at the beginning of schizophrenia, pointed out by Conrad and by Chapman, has been verified by other researchers [<a href=""#B7"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B7"">7</a>]. There is a close relationship between anxiety and schizophrenia. Anxiety often precedes [<a href=""#B7"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B7"">7</a>–<a href=""#B12"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B12"">12</a>] and accompanies [<a href=""#B13"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B13"">13</a>, <a href=""#B14"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B14"">14</a>] schizophrenia and is one of its risk factors [<a href=""#B9"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B9"">9</a>, <a href=""#B15"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B15"">15</a>]. Longitudinal studies have shown that anxiety precedes paranoia, and this seems to exclude the possibility that paranoid ideas can be the cause of the anxiety that accompanies schizophrenia [<a href=""#B7"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B7"">7</a>, <a href=""#B16"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B16"">16</a>].</p>"
"<p>A possible relationship between disturbances in the perception of the aspect of the environment and anxiety seems understandable, since an unexplainable alteration of forms such as that found at the beginning of schizophrenia could render the environment different and unknown, and this might justify the onset of an anxious state. For example, an unknown environment is used as a stimulus to cause anxiety in experiments on animals [<a href=""#B17"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B17"">17</a>, <a href=""#B18"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B18"">18</a>], and it is sufficient to provoke a dramatic [<a href=""#B19"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B19"">19</a>] increase of anxiety. Moreover, distortions of the visual aspect of objects could make the environment not only new, but also inexplicably deformed, and for that reason all the more dangerous and frightening.</p>"
"<p>The visual deformations could be caused by visual defects, and many visual defects, the best known of which is a reduced sensitivity to contrast, have been found in schizophrenia [<a href=""#B20"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B20"">20</a>]. However it is not clear whether these defects, identifiable only through particular tests of the eyesight and present also in patients with only depressive disturbances [<a href=""#B21"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B21"">21</a>, <a href=""#B22"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B22"">22</a>], can go so far as to cause the serious deformations of the form of objects reported by the patients of Conrad, Chapman, and Cutting and Dunne (for a recent review of the literature on perceptive alterations in schizophrenia and in its prodromal phase, see Silverstein 2016 [<a href=""#B23"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B23"">23</a>]).</p>"
"<p>However, perhaps it is not necessary for the visual deformations to be caused exclusively by visual problems: perhaps the images we see are in reality already deformed; only we do not normally notice it. In fact, the image of the world we receive through what we see has to be continuously reassembled and reorganized; otherwise it could become distorted and fragmented and could change so much that we would hardly recognize it. According to Muth et al., for example, “our perceptual impressions of an object and its context are in permanent flux as we move or as the object moves or transforms itself: the (perceived) world is not static but permanently physically changing” [<a href=""#B24"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B24"">24</a>, p. 2]. We must immediately realize that foreshortening is not a real deformation, that an object that is partially hidden is not cut off but extends under the cover, that a cloud seen through the branches of a tree is not part of the tree, and so on. For example, every time we look at a three-dimensional object from a different angle: “the observer should be expected to see an object of changing shape. The cube should undergo constant amoebic transformations … Fortunately, but surprisingly enough, this does not happen.” [<a href=""#B25"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B25"">25</a>, p. 71]. However, perhaps this might happen if something interferes with the mechanism of the indispensable continuous reorganization and interpretation of an “amoebic” reality. In this case, the alterations might become evident, objects might seem deformed and frightening, sky and clouds might seem head-spinningly close to the observer, making the surrounding world flat and oppressive, and so on.</p>"
"<p>Even in a person without psychiatric pathologies, the sudden awareness of a deformation of the appearance of the environment, deformation that had always been present but had previously been ignored, may give rise to intense anxiety. An example of this can be found in<em> Art and Visual Perception</em>, a book by Arnheim, former president of the Division on Psychology and the Arts of the American Psychological Association, where the author describes the distressed reaction of a student when, following a suggestion by the teacher, she became aware of the deformations assumed by the appearance of an object according to the viewpoint from which it was observed, deformations which she had always corrected automatically without realizing it. “It is very difficult for many persons to visualize the working of perspective, even when it is demonstrated to them with a yardstick. Recently an intelligent and sensitive young college student, to whom I tried to show the oblique shape of a box on the table, finally hid her face in sudden terror and exclaimed, ‘It is true - how horrible!'” [<a href=""#B25"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B25"">25</a>, p. 160]. And in the case reported by Arnheim it was only a completely explainable alteration of the appearance of a single small object.</p>"
"<p>One of the possible factors that might interfere with the indispensable and continuous reconstruction of the world could be anhedonia. Anhedonia has been considered a core symptom of schizophrenia [<a href=""#B26"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B26"">26</a>, <a href=""#B27"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B27"">27</a>] and often precedes [<a href=""#B28"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B28"">28</a>–<a href=""#B30"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B30"">30</a>] and predicts [<a href=""#B11"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B11"">11</a>] the disorder. Anhedonia is also present in persons with a high risk of schizophrenia [<a href=""#B11"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B11"">11</a>, <a href=""#B31"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B31"">31</a>].</p>"
"<p>Pleasure has recently been subdivided into pleasure felt in the moment, or consummatory pleasure, and future or anticipatory pleasure [<a href=""#B32"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B32"">32</a>–<a href=""#B34"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B34"">34</a>]. Numerous studies indicate that in schizophrenia anhedonia concerns especially, or only, future pleasures [<a href=""#B35"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B35"">35</a>–<a href=""#B37"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B37"">37</a>]. Consummatory and anticipatory pleasure are, respectively, connected to the liking and wanting of the reward model suggested by Berridge and Robinson [<a href=""#B38"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B38"">38</a>] and it has been proposed that dopamine is more involved in the wanting process, while opioids are more involved in the liking process [<a href=""#B38"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B38"">38</a>]. However, the action of dopamine and that of opioids are closely interwoven and overlapped, since dopamine releases endogenous opioids [<a href=""#B39"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B39"">39</a>, <a href=""#B40"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B40"">40</a>], while the opioids in turn release dopamine in the nucleus accumbens [<a href=""#B41"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B41"">41</a>, <a href=""#B42"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B42"">42</a>]. In this chain of interconnections between dopamine and endogenous opioids, some authors believe that dopamine could be the “basic link” [<a href=""#B43"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B43"">43</a>]. Besides, anhedonia regarding in-the-moment pleasures has also been found in schizophrenia, both for pleasures in general [<a href=""#B34"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B34"">34</a>, <a href=""#B44"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B44"">44</a>, <a href=""#B45"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B45"">45</a>] and for only some of them such as unexpected pleasures [<a href=""#B46"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B46"">46</a>], social pleasures [<a href=""#B47"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B47"">47</a>–<a href=""#B49"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B49"">49</a>], and the pleasure of odours [<a href=""#B26"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B26"">26</a>, <a href=""#B50"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B50"">50</a>]. It has also been proposed that, in schizophrenia, anhedonia for in-the-moment pleasures may vary according to the type of pleasant sensation involved [<a href=""#B51"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B51"">51</a>].</p>"
"<p>Anhedonia is also present in anxiety [<a href=""#B52"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B52"">52</a>–<a href=""#B55"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B55"">55</a>]. Its presence in both schizophrenia and anxiety could be because both the former [<a href=""#B56"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B56"">56</a>–<a href=""#B60"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B60"">60</a>] and the latter [<a href=""#B61"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B61"">61</a>, <a href=""#B62"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B62"">62</a>] are induced by stress, and stress is regularly accompanied and followed by anhedonia in both man [<a href=""#B63"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B63"">63</a>–<a href=""#B68"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B68"">68</a>] and animals [<a href=""#B65"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B65"">65</a>, <a href=""#B66"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B66"">66</a>].</p>"
"<p>Anhedonia might possibly accompany stress because the loss of the pleasure of aiming for a goal and achieving it (including defending oneself and escaping from a danger) could lead to immobility, and immobility offers the extreme chance of safety when an animal is facing the worst possible stressful situation—being seized by a predator—as in this case any movement can further stimulate the predator's aggressiveness. It also might discourage devouring, since many predators are reluctant to eat the flesh of animals that have been dead for some time [<a href=""#B69"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B69"">69</a>], and the immobility that occurs when at the mercy of a predator is tonic (hence the term tonic immobility, or playing dead), that is, as rigid as an animal a few hours after death. Also rigidity might be influenced or caused by anhedonia, since the relaxation of the antagonist muscles coinciding with the action of the agonist muscles (a relaxation indispensable for each fluid movement whether active or passive) is linked to the ability to feel the pleasure connected to the movement [<a href=""#B70"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B70"">70</a>]. Tonic immobility might be connected to catatonia [<a href=""#B71"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B71"">71</a>], the inability to move and speak sometimes seen in serious depression and schizophrenia [<a href=""#B71"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B71"">71</a>, <a href=""#B72"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B72"">72</a>], but that can even happen to mentally sane people when they realize that death (the predator they can no longer evade) is imminent and inevitable [<a href=""#B71"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B71"">71</a>].</p>"
"<p>Some hormones are released during intense or repeated stress: adrenalin and noradrenaline which help to combat stress by increasing the flow of blood and glucose to the muscles and the brain; corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) which provokes the release of cortisone, the action of which accompanies and reinforces that of adrenalin and noradrenaline. The CRH also releases another hormone, dynorphin [<a href=""#B73"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B73"">73</a>–<a href=""#B75"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B75"">75</a>], which activates <em>κ</em> opioid receptors (KORs) in the central and peripheral nervous system. Dynorphin reduces the release of dopamine [DA] in the nucleus accumbens [<a href=""#B76"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B76"">76</a>, <a href=""#B77"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B77"">77</a>]. The dopamine released in the nucleus accumbens is the basis for generating pleasure [<a href=""#B78"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B78"">78</a>, <a href=""#B79"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B79"">79</a>], so that stress can reduce the ability to perceive pleasure by reducing dopamine through the action of dynorphin. On account of its ability to cause anhedonia, dynorphin has been considered to be responsible for depression due to stress [<a href=""#B80"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B80"">80</a>].</p>"
"<p>Dynorphin also causes anxiety [<a href=""#B75"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B75"">75</a>]. Its anxiogenic effect has not been considered in relation to anhedonia but has been considered a consequence of a direct action of dynorphin on the anxiogenic centres (in particular on the amygdala, through <em>κ</em> opioid receptors present in the amygdala) [<a href=""#B73"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B73"">73</a>]. However, some authors leave the possibility open that anhedonia could intervene in the pathogenesis of anxiety: “Given the high comorbidity of depressive and anxiety disorders, KOR signalling and control of DA function may underlie the pathogenesis of both” [<a href=""#B81"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B81"">81</a>, p. 442]. Besides, “recently, two lines of mice with mutations in the <em>κ</em> opioid receptor system were generated. One is a constitutive <em>κ</em> opioid receptor knockout (KOR<sup>−/−</sup>), the other is a conditional knockout (DAT-KOR<sub>lox/lox</sub>) in which <em>κ</em> opioid receptors are lacking in DA-containing neurons. Behavioral characterization demonstrated that DAT-KOR<sub>lox/lox</sub> mice displayed reduced anxiety-like behaviors in the open field and light/dark box tests. These findings suggest that the activation of <em>κ</em> opioid receptors in the mesocorticolimbic DA system plays a key role in anxiety” [<a href=""#B82"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B82"">82</a>, p. 785-786]. It is perhaps worth considering the possibility that a possible direct action of dynorphin on the anxiogenic centres may be accompanied by an indirect anxiogenic action mediated by the anhedonic effect of dynorphin. However, how could anhedonia arouse anxiety, that is, arouse an inexplicable fear of a grave imminent and unknown danger?</p>"
"<p>According to many researchers, our capacity to feel pleasure can influence our ability to perceive and link sensory information and the ability to learn. For example, in animals, when two separate stimuli, which individually do not provoke pleasure, are mentally connected to each other, the formation of this new bond causes pleasure, and this is considered important for learning in general [<a href=""#B83"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B83"">83</a>, <a href=""#B84"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B84"">84</a>]. In man, satisfying a curiosity is pleasant [<a href=""#B85"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B85"">85</a>], just as it is pleasant to grasp an inner meaning [<a href=""#B86"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B86"">86</a>], and the pleasure connected to awaiting a novelty (novelties are pleasant [<a href=""#B87"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B87"">87</a>]) facilitates learning [<a href=""#B88"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B88"">88</a>].</p>"
"<p>As regards the visual aspect in particular, recognizing an expected image gives pleasure, and if the image is unexpected the pleasure is even greater [<a href=""#B89"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B89"">89</a>]. Recognizing a shape in an ambiguous context gives pleasure [<a href=""#B86"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B86"">86</a>], and this stimulates us to look for other ambiguous shapes to discover their correct shape [<a href=""#B24"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B24"">24</a>]. Getting rid of visual ambiguity gives pleasure in the same way as escaping a danger [<a href=""#B90"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B90"">90</a>], and visual learning is also facilitated by a simultaneous pleasure, even if this pleasure is completely extraneous to vision [<a href=""#B91"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B91"">91</a>].</p>"
"<p>Anhedonia, both consummatory and anticipatory, could reduce these pleasures and therefore interfere with the correct processing of visual sensations. According to Der-Avakian et al., “if an individual is unable to derive pleasure from a normally rewarding activity or from anticipation of that activity, then it is unlikely that the individual will be motivated to pursue that activity” [<a href=""#B92"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B92"">92</a>, p. 245]. It therefore seems possible that, in the case of anhedonia, the spur to perceive, link, and interpret all the unceasing new and different aspects of what we see (e.g., understanding that foreshortening does not imply deformation of the whole object but just depends on the viewer's angle) might be weaker, or be lacking. In this case, the usual appearance of objects may change, and various degrees of alteration of the aspect of the environment might result.</p>"
"<p>If this happens, then perhaps even just a very brief, but unexpected and inexplicable, deformation of some aspect of the environment might give in some cases the sensation that the apparent normality of the objects is only a fragile veil, which could be torn and reveal inexplicable and frightening deformities. Even just the vague feeling that this might happen might induce indefinable, inexpressible fear of imminent catastrophe, generating a state of anxiety, the cause of which cannot be explained to other people because the sufferers cannot explain it to themselves. Moreover, to provoke a reaction of fear or anxiety it is not necessary to be aware that one has seen a danger: the danger can influence behaviour also if seen only subliminally, unconsciously [<a href=""#B93"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B93"">93</a>–<a href=""#B95"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B95"">95</a>]; indeed, if a stimulus has been perceived unconsciously, the subsequent defence reactions may be stronger than when it is perceived consciously [<a href=""#B96"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B96"">96</a>, <a href=""#B97"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B97"">97</a>].</p>"
"<p>Close correspondences have been found between anxious reactions in anxiety disorders and the reactions of defence against a predator [<a href=""#B98"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B98"">98</a>–<a href=""#B100"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B100"">100</a>]. However, in anxiety disorders, since the predator does not exist, these defensive reactions would be unjustified and aberrant [<a href=""#B99"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B99"">99</a>, <a href=""#B100"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B100"">100</a>]. However, perhaps it is possible that, even in the absence of a real predator and excluding hallucinations, if certain facilitating external circumstances occur (e.g., stressful experiences with consequent serious anhedonia) a healthy person could in any time and unexpectedly feel faced with a predator. In fact, in man it is sufficient to feel cornered and with no possibility of escape for extreme defence reflexes to be triggered that occur when one is seized by a predator [<a href=""#B69"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B69"">69</a>], and a deformed environment not only can be felt hostile but takes away any possibility of finding a refuge; in addition any loss of the ability to see depth would prevent seeing an escape route. In this case, inexplicable environmental deformations could be equivalent to a very close and inescapable predator and the apparently aberrant defensive reactions of people with anxiety disorders could be justified.</p>"
"<p>Recently, concepts similar to Conrad's concerning delusional ideas (i.e., that they are an attempt to restore meaning in a chaotic, frightening word) have been expressed by various authors. According to Freeman et al., for example, “it is hypothesized that individuals prone to paranoid ideation are trying to make sense of feelings of oddness caused by internal anomalies (e.g. hallucinations, perceptual anomalies, arousal).” [<a href=""#B101"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B101"">101</a>, p. 1122], and according to Marwaha et al., in forms of psychosis: “the world comes to seem persistently unsafe. The sense that emotional experiences are out of one's personal control may prompt a search for meaning that may find explanations in terms of external influence.” [<a href=""#B102"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B102"">102</a>, p. 274].</p>"
"<p>On this point, it might be interesting to recall the observation of Owens that “anxiety phenomena may partially remit as psychotic features escalate” [<a href=""#B9"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B9"">9</a>, p. 390], that is, perhaps, when the classic symptoms of schizophrenia appear, including delusional ideas. This could suggest the possibility that delusional ideas might reduce anxiety because, as Conrad proposes, they allow a reorganization of reality with a new meaning, which does not correspond to the truth and is able to create serious problems in relationships with persons and things—for example, believing that the environment is artificially built in order to test the patient or to deceive him and so on [<a href=""#B2"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B2"">2</a>, p. 101]—but which is nevertheless not as frightening as the incomprehensible chaos that preceded. This might explain the relief with which schizophrenic patients seem to welcome the delusional reorganization of the environment, a relief which is very effectively expressed by Uhlhaas and Mishara in their discussion of the anomalies of perceptual processing in schizophrenia: “In beginning schizophrenia, the patient may have an agitated mood with the feeling that something very special or terrible is about to happen but is unable to say what this might be... Suddenly, from out of the fragments, the patient has an<em> aha erlebnis, </em>a sudden insight into the situation. This relieves the increasing distress due to the fragmentariness or gaps in the natural successive organization of this experience in time. The seeming “insight” of the delusion imposes a retroactive organization on the collected, non-temporalized fragments.” [<a href=""#B103"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B103"">103</a>, pp 147-148]. Fragments may refer to the inability to connect the various objects composing a scene, but also to individual objects, since in certain cases “not only the organization or the context between objects is loosened but also the objects themselves appear disintegrated” [<a href=""#B103"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B103"">103</a>, p 144].</p>"
"<p>This interpretation of the anxiety and of the delusional ideas present in schizophrenia could perhaps also help to propose a hypothesis to explain a fact that is still unexplained: blindness at birth seems to eliminate the risk of schizophrenia [<a href=""#B104"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B104"">104</a>, <a href=""#B105"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B105"">105</a>]. According to Silverstein et al., for example, in the United States there should be about 620 cases of people blind from birth who present schizophrenia, whereas in more than 60 years not a single case has been reported [<a href=""#B104"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B104"">104</a>]. One reason could be that those who are blind since birth cannot have had any deformed vision of their environment, and so they do not suffer any of the possible consequences, for example, the need for delusional ideas to interpret any deformations.</p>"
"<p>Taking into consideration the possibility that anhedonia could interfere with the correct reconstruction and interpretation of a world that continuously changes its appearance could perhaps help to explain the presence of alterations of the visual appearance of the environment found in the initial phase of schizophrenia. These alterations might be the cause of the anxious state that accompanies them, might sometimes provoke the sensation of being trapped by a predator, and according to some authors might induce delusional ideas.</p>"

"<p><strong>Background:</strong> Schizophrenia is a complex disorder characterized by positive symptoms (e.g., hallucinations), negative symptoms (e.g., social withdrawal), and disorganized symptoms (e.g., thought disorder). Alongside these, cognitive and depressive symptoms often emerge, with depressive symptoms sometimes dominating the clinical picture. Understanding the factors that influence the development of depressive symptoms in schizophrenia could clarify the dynamics between depressive and psychotic symptoms and guide clinical interventions. <strong>Methods:</strong> A total of 105 patients with schizophrenia (66 women, 39 men) were assessed using several clinical scales: PANSS, BPRS, DOCS, DES, HAM-D, and the Luria-Nebraska Neuropsychological Battery for cognitive evaluation. Statistical analyses, including correlation and regression, were conducted using SPSS to determine the significance of associations. <strong>Results:</strong> Disorganized and obsessive-compulsive symptoms were identified as primary factors associated with depressive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. Conversely, a longer duration of untreated psychosis was linked to a lower severity of depressive symptoms, suggesting that early intervention may alter the depressive symptom trajectory. <strong>Conclusions:</strong> Here, we suggest a complex interaction between psychotic and depressive symptoms, possibly indicating a biological antagonism. The association of depressive symptoms with disorganized and obsessive-compulsive features may reflect an adaptive psychological response, attempting to stabilize amidst the disintegration of schizophrenia. These insights support a more integrated approach to treatment, addressing both psychotic and depressive symptoms to improve patient outcomes.</p>"

"<p>Schizophrenia is a complex nosological entity that results from the interaction of genetic and epigenetic factors [<a href=""#B1-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B1-biomedicines-12-02646"">1</a>,<a href=""#B2-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B2-biomedicines-12-02646"">2</a>,<a href=""#B3-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B3-biomedicines-12-02646"">3</a>,<a href=""#B4-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B4-biomedicines-12-02646"">4</a>]. Genetic predisposition is easily detectable in the analysis of family history. This encumbrance in an etiological aspect cannot be accepted too categorically due to the influence of the impact of learned patterns of behavior, as well as the lack of stable parental role models. These factors can also be considered epigenetic impacts [<a href=""#B5-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B5-biomedicines-12-02646"">5</a>]. Analysis of the interaction of epigenetic influence and genetic polymorphism shows a relationship with both the development of the schizophrenia process and the effect of antipsychotic therapy [<a href=""#B6-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B6-biomedicines-12-02646"">6</a>]. The clinical picture of schizophrenic disorders is diverse, but positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms have been analyzed as the main storyline. In patients with schizophrenia, many other symptoms are also superimposed, such as anxiety, affective, and obsessive-compulsive disorders, as well as disorders in the perception of time and the perception of personal space [<a href=""#B7-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B7-biomedicines-12-02646"">7</a>,<a href=""#B8-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B8-biomedicines-12-02646"">8</a>]. All these deviations in mental status are also associated with changes in both metabolism and immunological markers [<a href=""#B9-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B9-biomedicines-12-02646"">9</a>,<a href=""#B10-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B10-biomedicines-12-02646"">10</a>]. All this multiplicity, both in the etiological and clinical aspects, poses the question of searching for a complex approach and therapeutic behavior that is consistent with the main and priority aspects in the clinical presentation [<a href=""#B11-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B11-biomedicines-12-02646"">11</a>,<a href=""#B12-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B12-biomedicines-12-02646"">12</a>,<a href=""#B13-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B13-biomedicines-12-02646"">13</a>].</p>"
"<p>Depressive symptoms and psychotic symptoms have many similarities and differences. These similarities and differences can be observed at the structural, functional, neurotransmitter, and metabolic levels. In both conditions, the analysis of structural disorders shows that we have a loss of gray brain matter in different parts of the brain, with a corresponding predilection for changes in them. In depression, changes are more pronounced in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex [<a href=""#B14-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B14-biomedicines-12-02646"">14</a>], and the amygdala and white brain matter [<a href=""#B15-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B15-biomedicines-12-02646"">15</a>]. In schizophrenia, they are associated with gray matter loss and cortical thickness reduction [<a href=""#B16-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B16-biomedicines-12-02646"">16</a>], as well as hippocampal and temporal lobe changes [<a href=""#B17-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B17-biomedicines-12-02646"">17</a>]. Functional changes in depression are associated with hyperactivity in the default mode network (DMN) [<a href=""#B18-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B18-biomedicines-12-02646"">18</a>] and hypoactivity in the executive control network (ECN), as well as hyperactivation of the amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) [<a href=""#B19-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B19-biomedicines-12-02646"">19</a>]. In psychosis, DMN hypoactivity and dysfunction [<a href=""#B20-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B20-biomedicines-12-02646"">20</a>] and dysregulation in the salience network (SN) [<a href=""#B21-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B21-biomedicines-12-02646"">21</a>] altered thalamocortical connectivity and dopamine system dysfunction [<a href=""#B22-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B22-biomedicines-12-02646"">22</a>]. Differences in the neurotransmitter system are also observed in both conditions. In depression, there are major changes in serotonin and norepinephrine [<a href=""#B23-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B23-biomedicines-12-02646"">23</a>], as well as in the glutamate and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis [<a href=""#B24-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B24-biomedicines-12-02646"">24</a>]. In schizophrenia, the main neurotransmitter changes are found in dopamine and glutamate [<a href=""#B25-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B25-biomedicines-12-02646"">25</a>,<a href=""#B26-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B26-biomedicines-12-02646"">26</a>], as well as in the dysfunction of NMDA receptor activity [<a href=""#B27-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B27-biomedicines-12-02646"">27</a>]. Differences can be found in a purely metabolic aspect, related to the metabolism of kynurenic acid. Schizophrenia shows a KYNA elevation that interferes with receptor activity crucial to cognitive function and psychosis [<a href=""#B28-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B28-biomedicines-12-02646"">28</a>] while depression often shows a neurotoxic shift, increasing quinolinic acid [<a href=""#B29-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B29-biomedicines-12-02646"">29</a>]. These changes also warrant the search for therapeutic strategies to influence kynurenic acid metabolism [<a href=""#B30-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B30-biomedicines-12-02646"">30</a>,<a href=""#B31-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B31-biomedicines-12-02646"">31</a>,<a href=""#B32-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B32-biomedicines-12-02646"">32</a>].</p>"
"<p>Depressive symptoms are frequent and characteristic symptoms observed in patients with schizophrenia. On the one hand, they can be observed as clinically established symptoms in the post-psychotic period, reaching up to 50% in patients with first episodes and up to 25% in those with subsequent episodes. The presence of these episodes is associated, according to some authors, with a poor prognosis [<a href=""#B33-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B33-biomedicines-12-02646"">33</a>,<a href=""#B34-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B34-biomedicines-12-02646"">34</a>]. The opinion of other authors takes an opposite position, associating affective symptoms with a favorable course of schizophrenia [<a href=""#B35-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B35-biomedicines-12-02646"">35</a>,<a href=""#B36-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B36-biomedicines-12-02646"">36</a>,<a href=""#B37-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B37-biomedicines-12-02646"">37</a>], especially in those with high values on the depression scale [<a href=""#B38-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B38-biomedicines-12-02646"">38</a>] and in those with high values on the mania scale [<a href=""#B39-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B39-biomedicines-12-02646"">39</a>]. The importance of depressive symptoms in the development of the schizophrenic process has led to their special classification in ICD 10 and ICD 11 as post-schizophrenic depression [<a href=""#B40-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B40-biomedicines-12-02646"">40</a>,<a href=""#B41-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B41-biomedicines-12-02646"">41</a>]. These divergent data indicate that depressive symptoms themselves are most likely to have a diverse genesis, which in turn is associated with a different prognosis. On the other hand, apart from being a clinically evident phenomenon, depressive symptomatology can be observed as a subclinical persistent finding in the clinical picture of patients, not always demonstrably presented and mixed with the main symptomatology. A study conducted with the aim of analyzing depressive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia showed that they are moderately pronounced and persistent over time in patients with resistance to treatment and are relatively mild in those in remission [<a href=""#B42-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B42-biomedicines-12-02646"">42</a>]. These data give us reason to conclude that smoldering depressive symptoms are associated with resistance to the schizophrenic process, while the appearance of pronounced depressive and manic symptoms is associated with a good prognosis.</p>"
"<p>In the analysis of the factors related to the presence of depressive symptoms, the author team established a relationship between the negative subscale of the PANSS and the scale of general psychopathology with sociodemographic factors such as loneliness, isolation, and lack of support [<a href=""#B43-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B43-biomedicines-12-02646"">43</a>,<a href=""#B44-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B44-biomedicines-12-02646"">44</a>]. On the other hand, whether there is a connection with sociodemographic factors as a cause of depressive symptoms or whether sociodemographic factors are a consequence of the development of the schizophrenic process with the gradient loss of social connectivity associated with its progression is a question that can be discussed. In this case, it is difficult to give an exact answer, as an analogy can be made with the question: ""Which came first - the chicken or the egg?""”</p>"
<p>There are multivariate analyses that present a different clinical value of depressive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. This lack of consistency in research gave us reasons to look for and establish the relationship between depressive symptoms and other factors and symptoms in patients with schizophrenia.</p>
"<p>In the analysis of the factors related to depressive symptoms, we considered it appropriate not to include the sociodemographic data. Due to the fact that they also appear as a result of the persistence of the main symptoms of the schizophrenia process, depressive complaints, in themselves and as the development of social maladaptation, appear to be directly deducible from the schizophrenic process.</p>"
"<p>We conducted a study of 105 patients with schizophrenia, of whom 66 were women and 39 were men. The examination and evaluation of the patients was carried out in the Psychiatric Clinic of the University General Hospital for Active Treatment —Stara Zagora. Patients were admitted for observation and treatment after consecutive psychotic episodes. The initial examination of the patients was performed in an outpatient setting, and after giving informed consent, they were admitted for treatment and assessment of the condition. Patients were recruited and followed for the period from 2017 to 2022.</p>"

"<p>For the purpose of the research, the capabilities of the statistical package SPSS version 26 were used. The methods used were tailored to the specifics and objectives of the research.

Independent variables were age, disease onset, duration of untreated symptoms, duration of schizophrenia process, body mass index, PANSS positive, negative, and disorganized symptoms, dissociation scale, and obsessive-compulsive symptom scale. An assessment of the co-linearity index was also made to measure the significance and reliability of the obtained results. We have also used analysis of variance (ANOVA) as a statistical formula used to compare variances across the means (or average) of different variables. A correlation analysis was also conducted to find a relationship between the analyzed variables. On the other hand, correlation analysis and its results are a prerequisite for the choice of method when conducting regression analysis.</p>"
"<p>The same group of patients was studied in order to investigate other clinical indicators such as obsessive-compulsive, dissociative, and cognitive symptoms, lateralization of brain processes, the effect of the administration of the first antipsychotic drug, and the role of gender in patients with schizophrenia [<a href=""#B42-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B42-biomedicines-12-02646"">42</a>,<a href=""#B54-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B54-biomedicines-12-02646"">54</a>,<a href=""#B55-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B55-biomedicines-12-02646"">55</a>,<a href=""#B56-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B56-biomedicines-12-02646"">56</a>,<a href=""#B57-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B57-biomedicines-12-02646"">57</a>,<a href=""#B58-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B58-biomedicines-12-02646"">58</a>,<a href=""#B59-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B59-biomedicines-12-02646"">59</a>,<a href=""#B60-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B60-biomedicines-12-02646"">60</a>].

"<p>The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital “Prof. Dr. Stoyan Kirkovich” Stara Zagora, protocol code TR3-02-242/30 December 2021.</p>"
"<p>Out of a total of 105 patients with schizophrenia, 66 were female and 39 were male. The mean age of patients was 37.13 years (<a href=""#biomedicines-12-02646-t001"" class=""usa-link"">Table 1</a>). The minimum age was 21 years and the maximum was 62 years.</p>"
<p>Some of the main characteristics of the group of patients.</p>

"<p>This analysis reveals that depressive symptoms are modestly associated with longer illness duration, suggesting that the chronicity of schizophrenia may contribute to increased depressive symptoms over time. However, onset age and duration of untreated symptoms do not appear to have direct impacts on depression levels. These findings point to a potentially cumulative effect of long-term schizophrenia on depressive experiences, which could suggest treatment approaches that address the emotional impact of prolonged illness.</p>"
"<p>The analysis of data in <a href=""#biomedicines-12-02646-t003"" class=""usa-link"">Table 3</a> reveals that depressive symptoms are moderately associated with overall psychiatric severity (PANSS and BPRS), particularly with disorganized symptoms. The findings suggest that disorganization, along with positive symptoms, may play a more significant role in the experience of depressive symptoms in schizophrenia than negative symptoms do. These insights highlight the importance of addressing both mood and cognitive disorganization in managing depressive symptoms within this population.</p>"
"<p>The analysis reveals that depressive symptoms are strongly associated with anxiety and obsessive-compulsive symptoms. In contrast, there is little to no significant relationship between depressive symptoms and dissociation or fixation. The strong link between anxiety and depression highlights the importance of addressing both conditions in clinical settings, as they often exacerbate each other. The associations found between dissociation and obsessive-compulsive symptoms suggest that these constructs may warrant further exploration, particularly in their relationship with depressive experiences. Also striking is the negative correlation between depressive symptoms and short-term memory reflected by fixation in this analysis. Overall, we can say that these findings emphasize the interconnected nature of various psychiatric symptoms and the need for comprehensive assessment and treatment strategies.</p>"
"<p>In order to establish the most important factors influencing the appearance of depressive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia, we conducted a regression analysis. Regression analysis was conducted, with the dependent variables being depressive symptoms. Independent variables were age, age of onset, duration of untreated symptoms, duration of schizophrenia process, body mass index (BMI), PANSS positive, negative, and disorganized symptoms, dissociation scale, and obsessive-compulsive symptom scale. The results are presented in <a href=""#biomedicines-12-02646-t005"" class=""usa-link"">Table 5</a> and <a href=""#biomedicines-12-02646-t006"" class=""usa-link"">Table 6</a>.</p>"
<p>Results of the regression analysis. The factors with a statistically significant influence on the occurrence of depressive symptoms and their coefficients are presented.</p>
<p>Statistical significance of established models when conducting regression analysis.</p>
<p>Regression analysis identified three main predictors and models.</p>
<p>These predictors are:</p>
"<p>PANSS Disorganized Symptoms: The strong positive impact of disorganized symptoms on depression highlights the significant role of cognitive and perceptual disorganization in contributing to depressive symptoms. This may reflect the distress and impairment that disorganized thinking and behavior impose, potentially fostering feelings of depressive complaints.</p>"
"<p>Duration of Untreated Symptoms: The negative relationship here suggests that individuals who experienced shorter periods of untreated psychosis report higher depressive symptoms. This finding could imply that early intervention mitigates long-term depressive symptoms, or that those who seek help sooner may be more likely to experience depression due to increased insight of their symptoms.</p>"
"<p>Obsessive-Compulsive Symptoms (OCS): The positive correlation between OCS scores and depressive symptoms implies that the presence of obsessive-compulsive symptoms may aggravate depressive symptoms, possibly due to the distress and mental strain associated with them.</p>"
"<p>Our study showed that gender distribution is not a factor related to the appearance of depressive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. In the main population, there is evidence that there is a clear distinction between the sexes, with depressive symptoms being more characteristic of females. This is also directly deducible from the differences between the sexes, related to biological, psychological, and social factors, which are a prerequisite for the prevalence of depressive symptoms in persons of the female gender [<a href=""#B61-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B61-biomedicines-12-02646"">61</a>]. This is not the case in patients with schizophrenia. One study examines gender differences in the onset and progression of schizophrenia, including the expression of depressive symptoms, and suggests that typical gender differences in depression may not apply to individuals with schizophrenia [<a href=""#B62-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B62-biomedicines-12-02646"">62</a>]. Our results support this study by showing that schizophrenia patients did not differ in terms of the expression of depressive complaints. Other articles have also discussed how schizophrenia may diminish the usual gender differences seen in mood disorders, with a focus on the expression of depressive symptoms [<a href=""#B63-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B63-biomedicines-12-02646"">63</a>,<a href=""#B64-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B64-biomedicines-12-02646"">64</a>,<a href=""#B65-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B65-biomedicines-12-02646"">65</a>]. Other studies have attempted to analyze the reasons for the lack of differences in the occurrence of depressive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. They examine and develop the concept of blunted gender differences in schizophrenia [<a href=""#B66-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B66-biomedicines-12-02646"">66</a>].</p>"
"<p>Another transcultural study also shows that there is a reduction of gender differences as a consequence of the influence of the schizophrenic process [<a href=""#B67-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B67-biomedicines-12-02646"">67</a>]. We also registered these blurred boundaries of gender differences in schizophrenia when conducting an assessment of the distribution of gender roles in patients with schizophrenia [<a href=""#B57-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B57-biomedicines-12-02646"">57</a>]. Our data also support the idea of blunted gender differences. The results of these studies give some authors reason to consider the idea of a strictly individual view and approach to these patients, not one based only on gender differences [<a href=""#B68-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B68-biomedicines-12-02646"">68</a>,<a href=""#B69-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B69-biomedicines-12-02646"">69</a>].</p>"
"<p>We find a directly proportional relationship between the expression of disorganized symptoms in schizophrenia and depressive symptoms. This dependence can be considered in the context that disorganized symptoms, unlike positive and negative symptoms, are directly related to functional impairment, which in turn leads to depressive complaints [<a href=""#B70-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B70-biomedicines-12-02646"">70</a>]. Negative symptoms are not perceived as ego-dystonic in the sense of suffering, and thus they do not lead to depressive complaints, although an overlap between depressive and negative symptoms may be observed outwardly, further impairing social functioning [<a href=""#B71-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B71-biomedicines-12-02646"">71</a>]. This close relationship between disorganized and depressive symptoms, as was shown in our previous study between disorganized and obsessive-compulsive symptoms [<a href=""#B54-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B54-biomedicines-12-02646"">54</a>], gives us reason to consider the idea of symptom formation as a consequence of the development of a process of “disintegration” in patients with schizophrenia. We can view depressive, positive, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms as defense mechanisms against the “disintegration” underlying the schizophrenic process [<a href=""#B72-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B72-biomedicines-12-02646"">72</a>,<a href=""#B73-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B73-biomedicines-12-02646"">73</a>,<a href=""#B74-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B74-biomedicines-12-02646"">74</a>].</p>"
"<p>This study also gives us an explanation of why we find obsessive-compulsive symptoms as a factor that is, to a large extent, a determinant of the appearance of depressive symptoms. Obsessive-compulsive symptoms themselves lead to severe stress and can further trigger the onset of depressive symptoms. Obsessive-compulsive symptoms in schizophrenia can also be seen as an adaptive phenomenon, a reaction against the chaos of disorganized symptoms [<a href=""#B75-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B75-biomedicines-12-02646"">75</a>].</p>"
"<p>We find the greatest association of depressive symptoms with disorganized and obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Another study of ours, which analyzed obsessive-compulsive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia, showed that they were also highly associated with the presence of disorganized symptoms [<a href=""#B54-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B54-biomedicines-12-02646"">54</a>]. Is it precisely the disorganized symptoms, symptoms without organization, that do not seek their secondary organization as psychotic, obsessive-compulsive, and depressive symptoms? Other studies also find a link between disorganized and depressive symptoms [<a href=""#B76-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B76-biomedicines-12-02646"">76</a>,<a href=""#B77-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B77-biomedicines-12-02646"">77</a>,<a href=""#B78-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B78-biomedicines-12-02646"">78</a>,<a href=""#B79-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B79-biomedicines-12-02646"">79</a>,<a href=""#B80-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B80-biomedicines-12-02646"">80</a>,<a href=""#B81-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B81-biomedicines-12-02646"">81</a>]. When conducting a correlation analysis, we found a high correlation dependence of depressive complaints, both with the individual subscales of the PANSS and with the BPRS scale. We found a higher correlation significance of depressive symptoms with disorganized symptoms and with the BPRS scale. The explanation of this observation can be found in the research that conducted a comparison between the PANSS and BPRS scales. The PANSS scale is much more specific than the BPRS. The BPRS scale reflects more the main psychopathology, which is also related to an overlap with some depressive and disorganized symptoms, which is the reason for their higher correlation coefficient [<a href=""#B82-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B82-biomedicines-12-02646"">82</a>,<a href=""#B83-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B83-biomedicines-12-02646"">83</a>,<a href=""#B84-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B84-biomedicines-12-02646"">84</a>].</p>"
"<p>Our study found that the duration of untreated symptoms was inversely related to the development of depressive symptoms. We find that the longer the duration of untreated psychosis, the lower the likelihood of developing depressive complaints. How should we analyze this observation?</p>"
"<p>In the context that psychosis is the primary and main disease, depressive symptomatology appears as an additional symptom in the course of the evolution of the disease or, on the other hand, as a side effect and as a symptom as a result of therapy. These relationships can be considered in the context of the relationship between dopamine blockade and depression, cognitive impairment associated with dopamine blockade, fatigue, sedation, motor side effects, etc. [<a href=""#B78-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B78-biomedicines-12-02646"">78</a>,<a href=""#B85-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B85-biomedicines-12-02646"">85</a>,<a href=""#B86-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B86-biomedicines-12-02646"">86</a>] . This is also the classic approach to looking at these relationships, and for this reason, in the F20 rubric of ICD 10 and 11, we have a sub-section on post-schizophrenic depression. Our data on the inverse correlation between depressive symptoms and duration of untreated psychosis prompts us to discuss another hypothesis. Since depressive symptomatology appears, on the one hand, as one of the main prodromal symptoms in schizophrenia, on the other hand, it represents a symptom that we can follow in the course of the schizophrenic process. From this point of view, the interrelationships between depressive and psychotic symptoms give us reason to ask the questionCan we not take a mirror look at these processes?</p>"
"<p>Depression is the primary disorder in which, in some cases, psychotic symptomatology is superimposed, which is clinically significant, expressed, and meets the diagnostic criteria of the main classification systems and, as such, requires antipsychotic therapy. In support of this observation comes the fact that often-expressed depression has psychotic symptoms that require antipsychotic therapy in parallel with the use of antidepressants [<a href=""#B87-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B87-biomedicines-12-02646"">87</a>,<a href=""#B88-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B88-biomedicines-12-02646"">88</a>,<a href=""#B89-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B89-biomedicines-12-02646"">89</a>,<a href=""#B90-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B90-biomedicines-12-02646"">90</a>,<a href=""#B91-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B91-biomedicines-12-02646"">91</a>].</p>"
"<p>On the other hand, the use of antidepressants has an effect on patients with schizophrenic disorder, even in the absence of clinically expressed depressive symptoms [<a href=""#B92-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B92-biomedicines-12-02646"">92</a>,<a href=""#B93-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B93-biomedicines-12-02646"">93</a>,<a href=""#B94-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B94-biomedicines-12-02646"">94</a>,<a href=""#B95-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B95-biomedicines-12-02646"">95</a>].</p>"
"<p>We can also judge the proximity of the two states by their prognosis. Both schizophrenia and psychotic depression have a similar prognosis, despite the presence of certain differences [<a href=""#B96-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B96-biomedicines-12-02646"">96</a>,<a href=""#B97-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B97-biomedicines-12-02646"">97</a>,<a href=""#B98-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B98-biomedicines-12-02646"">98</a>,<a href=""#B99-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B99-biomedicines-12-02646"">99</a>], which, again, gives us reason to question what is the primary underlying disorder. On the other hand, perhaps we should just accept that the question is largely rhetorical and that the two states are interwoven as one common entity.</p>"
"<p>These clinical observations give us reason to look at the biochemical disturbances in order to find similarities between them. In both conditions, a biochemical imbalance is established. In both conditions, there is a dopamine imbalance, disorders of serotonin, glutamate transmission, GABA mediation, an increased level of inflammatory factors, and a generally increased inflammatory background, associated with a change in cortisol secretion [<a href=""#B100-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B100-biomedicines-12-02646"">100</a>,<a href=""#B101-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B101-biomedicines-12-02646"">101</a>,<a href=""#B102-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B102-biomedicines-12-02646"">102</a>,<a href=""#B103-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B103-biomedicines-12-02646"">103</a>].</p>"
"<p>If we look at DMN changes in depression and psychosis, we find that they are opposite. While, in depression, we have hyperactivity [<a href=""#B18-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B18-biomedicines-12-02646"">18</a>], in schizophrenia, we have altered activity related to the loss of connectivity or altered activity to hypoactivity [<a href=""#B20-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B20-biomedicines-12-02646"">20</a>]. This process is most likely also related to the disorganization in the sense of “I”, which provokes the creation of clinical symptoms such as positive or depressive or OCD [<a href=""#B104-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B104-biomedicines-12-02646"">104</a>]. How can we explain, from this perspective based on DMN dysfunction, the inverse relationship between the duration of untreated psychosis and depressive symptoms? The prolonged state of dysfunction of this neuronal network over time is related to strengthening the loss of connectivity at the functional and neuronal level, where it becomes even more difficult to react with “hyperfunction” of the same system and transition to depression.</p>"
"<p>In patients with resistant schizophrenia, depressive symptoms are registered in the range of moderately expressed [<a href=""#B42-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B42-biomedicines-12-02646"">42</a>]. These results can be commented on in light of our observation that schizophrenic disorder, which is essentially a form of disorganization of the psyche, finds its clinical expression in the construction of disorganized symptoms as a clinical phenomenon. The organism is not able to reach a new form of mental allostasis, regardless of whether it is a psychotic or depressive episode, and remains in an unbalanced state with persistent disorganized symptoms, which also show the highest degree of resistance in individual studies [<a href=""#B105-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B105-biomedicines-12-02646"">105</a>,<a href=""#B106-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B106-biomedicines-12-02646"">106</a>,<a href=""#B107-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B107-biomedicines-12-02646"">107</a>].</p>"
"<p>Limitation: The limitation of our study is related, on the one hand, to the number of observed patients. In order to answer fundamental questions related to the perception and analysis of the clinical dynamics of larger nosological categories, observation of a large number of patients with a long follow-up period is necessary, which we are currently unable to provide. The observation of these patients continues, which gives us the opportunity to follow the pathoplasticity of the described phenomenology, which we hope to be able to present in the future.</p>"
"<p>Another limitation of our study is that it is purely clinical, as we did not have the opportunity to analyze the functional connections in individual neuronal networks, metabolic disorders, and individual registered inflammatory markers characterizing these processes.</p>"
"<p>We found that the presence of disorganized and obsessive-compulsive symptoms is associated with the appearance of depressive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. Additionally, an inverse relationship between the duration of untreated psychosis and the onset of depressive symptoms suggests that early intervention may impact the development of depressive features. These findings offer valuable insights for clinical practice, potentially enabling the prediction of individual symptom dynamics throughout the course of the schizophrenic process. Moreover, these observations prompt a reconsideration of the relationship between depression and psychosis as conditions that often exhibit convergent aspects in therapy. Rather than viewing them as separate entities, our results align with the concept of a single underlying pathology—a unified disease process that may express itself through varying symptom profiles over time. This perspective encourages a holistic approach to treatment, addressing core vulnerabilities that underpin both psychotic and depressive symptoms in a continuum of mental health disorders.</p>"

<p>Major depressive disorder contributes to the global burden of mental illness. Therapeutic guidelines promote treatment self-management and support caregivers and family members in this process.</p>
<p>We aimed to identify therapeutic guidelines for the symptoms of major depressive disorder.</p>
"<p>This scoping review followed the assumptions established by the Joanna Briggs Institute and the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) protocol, carried out in 12 databases (LILACS, PubMed, SciELO, Scopus, Web of Science, b-on, BDENF, AgeLine, Cochrane, BVS, IBECS, and CINAHL) and 5 secondary gray literature sources (Google Scholar, Global ETD Search, EBSCO Open Dissertations, CAPES Catalog of Theses and Dissertations, and the Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations of the University of Sao Paulo). The eligibility criteria were based on the population, concept, and context framework: people diagnosed with major depressive disorder aged &gt;18 years (population), therapeutic guidelines for self-management of major depressive disorder symptoms (concept), and symptoms of major depressive disorder (context). Data collection was carried out from March to July 2022 and updated in June 2024. The included studies were experimental, quasi-experimental, analytical observational, descriptive observational, qualitative, or quantitative studies; systematic reviews and meta-analyses; and scoping and literature reviews published in full without time restrictions in English, Spanish, or Portuguese. All the information, as well as the studies captured, was stored in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet using Rayyan and the <em>JBI Manual for Evidence Synthesis</em>. The titles, abstracts, and full texts were carefully read and classified, extracting the results. After review by 2 independent researchers, 62 studies were selected. The results are presented descriptively, including characterization of the studies and mapping and categorization of groups and subgroups of therapeutic guidelines for self-management of major depressive disorder.</p>"
"<p>In total, 62 studies published between 2011 and 2023 were included, where 44 (71%) came from indexed data sources and 18 (29%) were gray literature indexed on Google Scholar (13/62, 21%), doctoral theses (3/62, 5%), and master’s dissertations (2/62, 3%). Among the therapeutic guidelines identified, mapped, and categorized, 7 major groups were identified for self-management: psychotherapy (32/62, 52%), adoption of healthy habits (25/62, 40%), integrative and complementary practices (17/62, 27%), relaxation techniques (9/62, 14%), consultation with a health professional (14/62, 22%), pharmacological therapy (9/62, 14%), and leisure or pleasurable activities (4/62, 6%).</p>"
"<p>It was possible to identify therapeutic guidelines to promote self-management of major depressive disorder in the adult population. Therapeutic guidance is an important resource for patients, their families, and the community, making patients the protagonists of their own health. For health professionals, therapeutic guidelines become tools that help develop skills and competencies for care among patients, thus ensuring their ability to self-manage major depressive disorder.</p>"

"<p>Major depressive disorder is one of the most prevalent mental disorders in the world, as well as one of the clinical conditions that contributes most to the global burden of mental illnesses [<a href=""#ref1"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref1"">1</a>]. The number of people presenting with symptoms suggestive of this disorder has shown a significant increase at an alarming and worrying rate, and it is estimated that it will be the world’s first major disabling public health problem by 2030 [<a href=""#ref2"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref2"">2</a>].</p>"
"<p>It is a classic mental disorder that involves evident alterations in affect, cognition, and neurovegetative functions, affecting approximately 300 million people worldwide [<a href=""#ref2"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref2"">2</a>]. It is estimated that 3.8% of cases lead to functional incapacity and damage to physical and mental health, as well as professional losses and considerable morbidity and mortality due to suicide or association with other illnesses [<a href=""#ref3"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref3"">3</a>].</p>"
"<p>In addition to these impacts, it is difficult to diagnose major depressive disorder accurately and quickly as its classification and assessment are based on clinical findings and the patient’s history [<a href=""#ref2"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref2"">2</a>]. Therapies for the treatment of major depressive disorder, such as psychobiosocial therapies, psychotherapy, and pharmacotherapy, have advanced and are used according to the severity of the symptoms and potential adverse events [<a href=""#ref4"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref4"">4</a>]. Considering that mental health care has undergone important transformations, such as the creation of an out-of-hospital network made up of substitute services that propose the rescue of the singularity or subjectivity of the person in psychological distress, respecting their integrality and existence [<a href=""#ref5"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref5"">5</a>], promoting their autonomy in the management of the illness or treatment means encouraging empowerment, the ability to make choices, and taking responsibility for themselves as a citizen and social being [<a href=""#ref6"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref6"">6</a>].</p>"
"<p>This knowledge and skills are important tools to prevent complications, control symptoms, self-manage treatment, and even avoid recurrences and hospitalizations [<a href=""#ref7"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref7"">7</a>]. Due to the complexity of the disease, some adaptive actions can be taken, including controlling destabilizing factors, preserving self-confidence, re-establishing important relationships, attempting to regain functioning, managing symptoms, negotiating the care environment, and maintaining satisfying relationships [<a href=""#ref7"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref7"">7</a>,<a href=""#ref8"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref8"">8</a>].</p>"
"<p>Society has been moving toward the construction and adoption of technological innovations using smartphones and computer applications. These resources can be of great value in the process of promoting people’s skills in the mental health field [<a href=""#ref8"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref8"">8</a>]. In this sense, based on the results of this scoping review, a systematic set of therapeutic guidelines was developed based on clinical practice and scientific evidence. This set of therapeutic guidelines is capable of supporting a computational application, generating knowledge in the area of mental health, creating a connection with the patient, and supporting self-management of one’s health remotely [<a href=""#ref8"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref8"">8</a>,<a href=""#ref9"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref9"">9</a>].</p>"
"<p>These therapeutic guidelines can be adopted with the aim of promoting and supporting self-management in the daily treatment of the patient and supporting the caregiver or family members in performing techniques safely and appropriately, completing therapeutic sessions, maintaining functionality, or preventing possible complications of the disorder [<a href=""#ref9"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref9"">9</a>]. It should be emphasized that, although it is important to encourage self-management by the individual and the family, it is also essential that the care provided by health professionals, including nurses, assists in the promotion and reorganization of the self, breaks and overcomes relationships of dependence, and levels the acquisition or development of knowledge and skills for self-management [<a href=""#ref7"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref7"">7</a>,<a href=""#ref9"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref9"">9</a>].</p>"
"<p>Given the extent of the symptomatology and the particularities of major depressive disorder, a scoping review allows for an exhaustive analysis of the studies available so that the patient has access to information that will allow them to develop attitudes, knowledge, and skills to self-manage based on the best scientific evidence.</p>"
"<p>Similarly, a set of therapeutic guidelines will constitute an instrument for the clinical practice of nurses and of the multidisciplinary team as the deepening of specific skills will allow for the provision of individualized care that is more suited to the needs of the person with major depressive disorder. Therefore, this scoping review was carried out with the aim of identifying therapeutic guidelines in scientific production for the self-management of major depressive disorder symptoms.</p>"
"<p>A scoping review is used to map key concepts, examine existing evidence before conducting a systematic review, and clarify and define conceptual boundaries. This scoping review was prepared in accordance with the methodological proposal of the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) in 2020, supported by the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) [<a href=""#ref10"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref10"">10</a>] and PRISMA extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) [<a href=""#ref11"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref11"">11</a>] guidelines based on the following steps: formulation of the research question, identification of relevant studies, selection of studies, extraction and analysis of data, and synthesis and construction of the report. The PRISMA-ScR checklist is available in <a href=""#app1"" class=""usa-link"">Multimedia Appendix 1</a>. This review protocol was registered in the Open Science Framework platform [<a href=""#ref12"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref12"">12</a>] on November 11, 2023, and was modified on February 19, 2025. There was no deviation from the protocol registered on the Open Science Framework platform.</p>"
"<p>To formulate the guiding research question and guide data collection, the population, concept, and context (PCC) framework was used. The PCC strategy was adopted to drive the research question of this scoping review. In this study, <em>population</em> refers to people diagnosed with major depressive disorder aged &gt;18 years, <em>concept</em> refers to therapeutic guidelines for self-management of major depressive disorder symptoms, and <em>context</em> refers to major depressive disorder symptoms (eg, changes in weight, appetite, and sleep; feelings of guilt; irritability or bad mood; anhedonia; fatigue; and low self-esteem).</p>"
"<p>Therefore, the following guiding question was defined: “What therapeutic guidelines support self-management of changes in weight, appetite, sleep, feelings of guilt, irritability or bad mood, anhedonia, fatigue and low self-esteem?”</p>"
"<p>The data search was carried out in 12 information sources (LILACS, PubMed, SciELO, Scopus, Web of Science, b-on, BDENF, AgeLine, Cochrane, BVS, IBECS, and CINAHL) and 5 secondary information sources of gray literature (Google Scholar, Global ETD Search, EBSCO Open Dissertations, CAPES Catalog of Theses and Dissertations, and the Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations of the University of Sao Paulo).</p>"
"<p>The search strategy was developed using the controlled and noncontrolled descriptors obtained in the initial search plus the Boolean operators “OR,” “NOT,” and “AND,” as well as keywords found in the Health Sciences Descriptors and Medical Subject Headings of the US National Library of Medicine combined with each other according to each database.

"<p>The search followed five distinct phases according to the JBI methodology, and a team of 5 researchers was assembled for this scoping review: (1) initial search in the selected databases to identify articles on the topic and, from there, select words and indexing terms contained in these publications to develop the full search strategy; (2) use of the keywords and indexing terms identified to search all the databases included; (3) definition of the study design and eligibility criteria, including the determination of the type of study, target population, interventions and outcomes analyzed. In addition, inclusion and exclusion criteria were established for the selection of studies; (4) identification and selection of studies, including the systematic search in databases and sources of gray literature, application of filters and search strategies to ensure the identification of relevant studies and screening of relevant articles (reading of titles, abstracts and, when necessary, the full text); and (5) data extraction and analysis, including the collection of information from the selected studies, the assessment of methodological quality and the synthesis of findings.</p>"
"<p>The eligibility criteria are described in <a href=""#box1"" class=""usa-link"">Textbox 1</a>, and the studies found were refined based on the PCC acronym, type of study, year of publication, language, and results.

<strong>Inclusion criteria</strong>
</p>"
<p>Population: people diagnosed with major depressive disorder aged &gt;18 years</p>
<p>Concept: therapeutic guidelines for the self-management of symptoms of major depressive disorder</p>
"<p>Context: symptoms of major depressive disorder, such as changes in weight, appetite, and sleep; feelings of guilt; irritability or bad mood; anhedonia; fatigue; and low self-esteem</p>"
"<p>Type of study: experimental and quasi-experimental studies (randomized and nonrandomized controlled trials), analytical observational studies (prospective and retrospective cohort studies, case-control studies, and analytical cross-sectional studies), descriptive observational studies (case series, individual case reports, and descriptive cross-sectional studies), qualitative and quantitative studies, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, scoping reviews, and literature reviews; due to the scarcity of publications found in the databases, it was also decided to include gray literature (course completion studies, dissertations, and theses)</p>"
<p>Year: there were no restrictions on the search period as the first search strategies developed yielded few studies on the subject</p>
"<p>Language: English, Spanish, and Portuguese</p>"
<p>Results: publications whose objective addressed therapeutic guidelines to assist in the self-management of patients with active symptoms of major depressive disorder</p>
"<p>
<strong>Exclusion criteria</strong>
</p>"
"<p>Population, concept, and context: publications without information on the population, concept, and context of interest for this study</p>"
"<p>Type of study: duplicate studies, opinion articles, letters to the editor, abstracts of conference proceedings, and studies with unavailable text</p>"
<p>Language: studies in languages other than those selected</p>
"<p>Results: publications that did not fit the objectives and did not contain information related to the population, concept, and context of this study</p>"
"<p>The process of identifying and selecting studies is one of the most important stages in the conduct of a scoping review. To minimize potential bias, the <em>JBI Manual for Evidence Synthesis</em> guidelines were used and explained in a meeting with 6 researchers to ensure that this process was clear to everyone.</p>"
"<p>Thus, to maintain the rigor of the screening process, the studies obtained from each of the databases based on the eligibility criteria were exported to a reference management software (EndNote; Clarivate Analytics), and duplicates were removed. The remaining studies were then imported into the Rayyan application (Qatar Computing Research Institute) for analysis and selection based on titles and abstracts.</p>"
"<p>The titles and abstracts were read and analyzed by 2 independent reviewers to identify those that were potentially eligible. After reading the titles and abstracts, the preselected studies were subjected to data analysis and mapping, which consisted of carefully reading and classifying the texts from which the results were extracted.</p>"
<p>The selected studies were read in full by 2 additional reviewers (MdPSdSN and PdCT) to confirm their relevance to the research question. Any doubts about the inclusion of studies would be resolved through discussion with a third reviewer until a consensus was reached. It was not necessary to contact a third reviewer.</p>
"<p>As recommended by the JBI, the authors developed a tool to extract the data for the scoping review. Those responsible for data extraction (MdPSdSN, PdCT, and PMM) read and carefully classified the texts. The data were documented in a Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corp) spreadsheet for better data extraction and evaluation. The final studies were determined from this step. The following variables were extracted from the studies: symptoms, authors, year, reference, study title, objective, study design, and mapping of results.</p>"
"<p>The focuses of the studies were analyzed, and the results and discussion are presented descriptively and quantified as frequencies in tables. The Discussion section synthesizes the evidence found during the review to explore it and compare it with the existing literature.</p>"
"<p>The mapped results were categorized into 7 major groups and subgroups of therapeutic orientations for the self-management of major depressive disorder based on the similarities between them. For example, therapeutic orientations focused on physical activity or regular exercise and healthy eating were classified as adoption of healthy habits, whereas listening to music, watching movies, reading, painting, going out with friends, taking outdoor walks, and practicing spiritual and religious activities were grouped in the category of leisure or pleasurable activities. This was done for all the therapeutic orientations identified considering the objective of this scoping review.</p>"
"<p>Regarding the methodological assessment (although it was not mandatory), each included study had its level of evidence identified based on the JBI appraisal tools [<a href=""#ref13"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref13"">13</a>] and the study design.</p>"
"<p>Thus, classification I was assigned to systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials, classification II was assigned to randomized clinical trials, classification III was assigned to nonrandomized controlled trials, classification IV was assigned to case-control or cohort studies, classification V was assigned to systematic reviews of qualitative or descriptive studies, classification VI was assigned to qualitative or descriptive studies, and classification VII was assigned to opinions of authorities or expert committee reports. This hierarchy classifies levels I and II as strong, levels III to V as moderate, and levels VI to VII as weak.</p>"
"<p>Initially, 258,509 potentially eligible publications were found in the databases and 13,081 publications in the gray literature sources, of which 1538 (0.63%) focused on sleep disorders, 8315 (3.39%) focused on appetite disorders, 6732 (2.74%) focused on weight disorders, 5814 (2.37%) focused on feelings of guilt, 2509 (1.02%) focused on irritable mood, 200,002 (81.46%) focused on low self-esteem, 1848 (0.75%) focused on anhedonia, and 31,832 (7.64%) focused on fatigue.</p>"
"<p>The inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied, and 247,348 duplicate studies were removed, leaving 11,242 (4.55%). Next, a new screening was carried out in search of available publications that had abstracts and dealt with therapeutic guidelines.

"<p>Once the 1242 studies had been selected, the second full reading was carried out. Of the 1242 studies, 1180 (95.01%) were excluded because they did not answer the guiding question.

<p>General characterization of the included studies (N=62).</p>
"<p>It was found that the studies were published between 2011 and 2023, with a higher number of publications in the years 2018 to 2023 (40/62, 63%), demonstrating that the use of therapeutic guidelines is recently evolving. In terms of language, most publications were in English (North America—United States) and Portuguese (South America—Brazil), totaling 63% (40/62) of the publications (<a href=""#table1"" class=""usa-link"">Table 1</a>).</p>"
"<p>Regarding study design, the studies were clinical trials (30/62, 48%), systematic reviews (6/62, 10%), narrative literature reviews (7/62, 11%), systematic reviews and meta-analyses (6/62, 10%), qualitative studies (3/62, 5%), pilot studies (3/62, 5%), experimental studies (2/62, 3%), case reports (2/62, 3%), noncontrolled studies (1/62, 2%), cross-sectional studies (1/62, 2%), and scoping reviews (1/62, 2%; <a href=""#table1"" class=""usa-link"">Table 1</a>).</p>"

"<p>The evidence available from the included studies to promote self-management of the symptoms of major depressive disorder describes the characteristics, benefits, and applicability of therapeutic guidelines in everyday life, demonstrating that these guidelines can promote a safe space to share conversations on sensitive subjects such as stigma and prejudice, adverse drug events, diagnosis, and relapse [<a href=""#ref14"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref14"">14</a>-<a href=""#ref75"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref75"">75</a>].</p>"
"<p>The findings also point out that, to promote self-management through therapeutic guidelines, it is necessary to know the functionality of the patient or family, have access to community resources and a social support network, and monitor the participation of these individuals in their care [<a href=""#ref16"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref16"">16</a>,<a href=""#ref33"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref33"">33</a>,<a href=""#ref35"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref35"">35</a>,<a href=""#ref37"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref37"">37</a>,<a href=""#ref40"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref40"">40</a>]. The interdisciplinary team’s online or face-to-face follow-up of patients with major depressive disorder involves monitoring the use of therapeutic guidelines and whether they are being carried out correctly and appropriately considering the individual’s uniqueness, as well as monitoring changes in symptoms and problems with medication, providing social support, and identifying patients at high risk of relapse [<a href=""#ref23"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref23"">23</a>,<a href=""#ref41"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref41"">41</a>].</p>"
"<p>Another common point cited in the studies was the ability of health professionals to instruct patients with major depressive disorder on how to deal with symptoms and biosociopsychological demands [<a href=""#ref16"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref16"">16</a>,<a href=""#ref31"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref31"">31</a>-<a href=""#ref33"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref33"">33</a>]. Professionals require skills and good communication with patients when instructing them on the use of therapeutic guidelines for managing the disorder, since incorrect instructions or misunderstandings may make the application of therapeutic guidelines less efficient [<a href=""#ref23"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref23"">23</a>,<a href=""#ref35"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref35"">35</a>,<a href=""#ref37"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref37"">37</a>,<a href=""#ref40"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref40"">40</a>,<a href=""#ref67"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref67"">67</a>,<a href=""#ref70"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref70"">70</a>,<a href=""#ref74"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref74"">74</a>,<a href=""#ref75"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref75"">75</a>]. If the professional advises the patient to sunbathe (phototherapy) during the day, but does not specify the time, this may cause the patient to take this guidance at inappropriate times and be harmful to their health. Therefore, phototherapy would not be effective. The findings encourage a multidisciplinary approach to the applicability of therapeutic guidelines, focusing on the specificities of each person and collective actions, strengthening the patient’s ability to self-manage.</p>"
"<p>The analysis of the studies, as described previously, resulted in the mapping and categorization of 7 large groups of therapeutic guidelines for the self-management of major depressive disorder.

"<p>In total, 52% (32/62) of the therapeutic guidelines identified fell into the category of psychotherapy, which helps monitor and plan activities with the person (in the context of their symptoms), manage adverse experiences, and develop social skills [<a href=""#ref14"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref14"">14</a>,<a href=""#ref16"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref16"">16</a>,<a href=""#ref17"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref17"">17</a>,<a href=""#ref22"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref22"">22</a>,<a href=""#ref23"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref23"">23</a>,<a href=""#ref26"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref26"">26</a>,<a href=""#ref28"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref28"">28</a>,<a href=""#ref29"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref29"">29</a>,<a href=""#ref31"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref31"">31</a>,<a href=""#ref36"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref36"">36</a>-<a href=""#ref38"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref38"">38</a>,<a href=""#ref46"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref46"">46</a>,<a href=""#ref56"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref56"">56</a>,<a href=""#ref58"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref58"">58</a>-<a href=""#ref72"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref72"">72</a>,<a href=""#ref74"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref74"">74</a>,<a href=""#ref75"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref75"">75</a>]. Adoption of healthy habits (25/62, 40%) and integrative and complementary practices (17/62, 27%) were the second and third most observed categories.

"<p>Finally, relaxation techniques (9/62, 14%), consultation with a health professional (14/62, 22%), pharmacological therapy (9/62, 14%), and leisure or pleasurable activities (4/62, 6%) were the least observed therapeutic guidelines in the studies. However, they offered promising insights into self-management of the disorder and underscored the importance of a multifaceted approach to managing this complex condition [<a href=""#ref16"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref16"">16</a>,<a href=""#ref20"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref20"">20</a>,<a href=""#ref23"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref23"">23</a>, <a href=""#ref26"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref26"">26</a>-<a href=""#ref30"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref30"">30</a>,<a href=""#ref33"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref33"">33</a>,<a href=""#ref36"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref36"">36</a>-<a href=""#ref38"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref38"">38</a>,<a href=""#ref41"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref41"">41</a>,<a href=""#ref50"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref50"">50</a>,<a href=""#ref57"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref57"">57</a>,<a href=""#ref66"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref66"">66</a>].</p>"
"<p>It is widely recognized that the concept of self-management is traditionally associated with approaches that the patient can carry out autonomously, such as adopting healthy habits, physical exercise, and relaxation techniques. However, it is crucial to emphasize that, in the context of major depressive disorder, self-management transcends these independent symptom management practices [<a href=""#ref37"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref37"">37</a>].</p>"
"<p>It involves empowering the patient to take active control and gain an in-depth understanding of their condition through the application of a variety of therapeutic interventions [<a href=""#ref35"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref35"">35</a>]. Patients with major depressive disorder may experience feelings of frustration and a range of negative thoughts, see everyday problems as major catastrophes, have difficulty recognizing efforts that awaken hope for life, and cope with the possible adverse events that psychiatric medications can cause [<a href=""#ref66"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref66"">66</a>].</p>"
"<p>For this reason, orientation toward psychotherapy and psychopharmaceuticals is justified as a self-management strategy as a way of coping with the adverse effects of medication and all the feelings of self-demand, excessive demands, and frustration caused by the disorder.</p>"
"<p>In relation to the population to which this study refers, the results show that patients with major depressive disorder have motivational, cognitive, and psychological deficits that can modify their ability to cope and reason [<a href=""#ref22"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref22"">22</a>,<a href=""#ref60"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref60"">60</a>,<a href=""#ref63"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref63"">63</a>,<a href=""#ref65"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref65"">65</a>].</p>"
"<p>In view of this, self-management of the signs and symptoms resulting from major depressive disorder needs to take place at the beginning of treatment, with the support of family or caregivers; friends; community organizations; and, most especially, the multi-professional health team to help with the correct use of therapeutic options until the person is able to self-manage independently [<a href=""#ref14"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref14"">14</a>-<a href=""#ref75"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref75"">75</a>]. Therefore, the therapeutic guidelines found in this review are not restricted to the professional-patient relationship; these relationships are broad and include families and the community.</p>"
"<p>From this review, it was possible to identify the therapeutic guidelines for the self-management of the symptoms of major depressive disorder in scientific production as psychotherapy, adoption of healthy habits, integrative and complementary practices, relaxation techniques, consultation with a health professional, pharmacological therapy, and leisure or pleasurable activities.</p>"
"<p>The selected studies show that knowledge on the subject significantly improves self-management of the symptoms of major depressive disorder through these therapeutic guidelines to promote behavior changes and awareness of the symptoms of the disorder, prevention of relapses, reduction of the perception of obstacles, and increased adherence to treatment.</p>"
"<p>A small number of articles published in journals on the subject were found for all the symptoms investigated, especially irritable mood, followed by fatigue, weight change, appetite change, sleep changes, and low self-esteem, necessitating the addition of secondary documents that considerably broadened the identification of other therapeutic guidelines.</p>"
"<p>Most of the studies originated in America (40/62, 63%), where the largest number of people with major depressive disorder is concentrated. Regarding the concept that triggered the research, the studies involved health professionals, students, and the general population, covering the definition, description, comparative analysis, efficiency, and applicability of therapeutic guidelines. These studies were included to increase the possibility of nurses playing a leading role in the self-management of symptoms of major depressive disorder [<a href=""#ref14"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref14"">14</a>-<a href=""#ref75"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref75"">75</a>].</p>"
"<p>The factors considered important for the self-application of therapeutic guidelines in the studies were cognition; level of education; environmental factors; and the functional capacity of the patient, caregivers, and family members. It should be emphasized that, for self-management, clients who are going to follow these therapeutic guidelines should receive them in clear and objective language and format, with specificity and relevance for each symptom, enabling adherence to treatment and favoring the therapist–patient or caregiver bond [<a href=""#ref26"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref26"">26</a>]. These therapeutic guidelines are also considered low cost and easy to use, optimize rehabilitation and autonomy, and encourage self-care [<a href=""#ref26"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref26"">26</a>]. It is important to highlight the definitions of each of the therapeutic guidelines identified in this review.</p>"
"<p>Integrative and complementary practices, as therapeutic resources based on traditional knowledge, were the therapeutic guidelines most commonly found in the literature as effective for the self-management and management of major depressive disorder symptoms, and their applicability aimed to induce a state of harmony and balance throughout the body.</p>"
"<p>Phototherapy has been shown to reduce depressive symptoms and improve irregularities in sleep patterns and quality, especially in older adults with major depressive disorder, as long as it is used with a certain frequency and is administered before 10 AM [<a href=""#ref14"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref14"">14</a>-<a href=""#ref16"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref16"">16</a>,<a href=""#ref26"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref26"">26</a>]. It has also been used in the control of nocturnal hyperphagia and has shown reductions in the percentage of food eaten after dinner and in the number of nocturnal meals eaten per week, reducing the rate of overweight and obesity, as well as being used in the control of fatigue, where it has shown a reduction in the feeling of tiredness [<a href=""#ref29"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref29"">29</a>].</p>"
"<p>Music therapy applied to adults [<a href=""#ref24"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref24"">24</a>] has been shown to be effective in physical and mental relaxation, reducing anxious and depressive symptoms and promoting well-being in a conscious and healthy way [<a href=""#ref30"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref30"">30</a>]. Listening to soothing noises and classical music associated with rhythmic breathing produced a significantly higher rate of adherence to major depressive disorder treatment, especially in the patients with the highest severity [<a href=""#ref31"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref31"">31</a>-<a href=""#ref33"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref33"">33</a>].</p>"
"<p>A study has shown that anhedonia and clinically significant depressive symptoms can be resistant to standard treatment but adjuvant treatment with high-frequency inaudible sound therapy increases the reward of related brain circuits and has a synergistic effect on anhedonia [<a href=""#ref31"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref31"">31</a>]. Integrating music therapy with conventional major depressive disorder treatment (therapies and medication) gives people the opportunity to get in touch with their emotions and provides distraction and a means of communication capable of overcoming barriers and limits to verbal expression [<a href=""#ref30"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref30"">30</a>].</p>"
"<p>Yoga [<a href=""#ref29"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref29"">29</a>,<a href=""#ref34"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref34"">34</a>,<a href=""#ref35"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref35"">35</a>] has been a beneficial exercise for managing sleep quality and other symptoms of major depressive disorder [<a href=""#ref25"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref25"">25</a>,<a href=""#ref36"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref36"">36</a>]. It is an important tool for promoting self-care and, consequently, care for everything around the patient [<a href=""#ref37"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref37"">37</a>]. A study carried out to explore the experiences of patients with major depressive disorder showed that practicing yoga as a self-management strategy helped them gain better insights into their own condition, improving the quality of their health care [<a href=""#ref37"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref37"">37</a>].</p>"
"<p>Tai chi has been shown to be more effective than traditional rehabilitation (psychotropic drugs and therapies) in relation to insomnia, with an improvement in the quality, duration, and efficiency of sleep and a reduction in thoughts of guilt associated with major depressive disorder [<a href=""#ref17"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref17"">17</a>,<a href=""#ref29"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref29"">29</a>,<a href=""#ref38"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref38"">38</a>].

"<p>With regard to herbal medicines, St John’s wort, <em>chai hu</em>, and <em>gancao</em> were the most widely used.

"<p>In more severe cases, practicing physical activity can be difficult for people with major depressive disorder [<a href=""#ref55"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref55"">55</a>]. This can compromise adherence and long-term permanence in the exercise program [<a href=""#ref52"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref52"">52</a>]. It is recommended to prescribe structured exercises based on the activities already practiced by the patient to reduce obstacles [<a href=""#ref33"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref33"">33</a>].</p>"
"<p>Another group of therapeutic guidelines that were also commonly identified in this review were psychotherapies. Mindfulness-based therapy [<a href=""#ref58"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref58"">58</a>,<a href=""#ref59"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref59"">59</a>] is a promising therapeutic approach for treating major depressive disorder and is part of the list of integrative and complementary practices [<a href=""#ref26"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref26"">26</a>,<a href=""#ref37"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref37"">37</a>,<a href=""#ref60"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref60"">60</a>]. It combines elements of therapeutic guidelines [<a href=""#ref22"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref22"">22</a>,<a href=""#ref61"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref61"">61</a>] with the aim of helping people develop a full awareness of the present moment, accepting and acknowledging their thoughts, emotions, and bodily sensations without judgment [<a href=""#ref62"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref62"">62</a>] and learning to observe their negative thoughts and dysfunctional thought patterns without allowing themselves to be involved with or controlled by them [<a href=""#ref63"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref63"">63</a>].</p>"
"<p>Mindfulness improves self-management of prodromal symptoms [<a href=""#ref64"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref64"">64</a>], represents a stability factor when practiced frequently and in a supervised manner [<a href=""#ref28"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref28"">28</a>], positively influences memory and distorted feelings of guilt, increases cognitive resilience, balances mood and sleep, reduces high levels of stress, and improves self-esteem and anxiety [<a href=""#ref65"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref65"">65</a>] associated with major depressive disorder relapse.</p>"
"<p>Similarly, cognitive behavioral psychotherapy [<a href=""#ref26"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref26"">26</a>,<a href=""#ref66"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref66"">66</a>] uses positive reinforcement techniques and systematic desensitization, helping people cope with stress, face the challenges of everyday life, change negative thought patterns and behaviors to more realistic and positive ones [<a href=""#ref23"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref23"">23</a>,<a href=""#ref67"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref67"">67</a>], and identify the first signs of relapse and prevent it as it focuses on social skill training [<a href=""#ref68"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref68"">68</a>,<a href=""#ref69"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref69"">69</a>]. Recently, online cognitive behavioral psychotherapy has been shown to be effective for depressed and angry mood as a cost-effective treatment modality for major depressive disorder [<a href=""#ref70"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref70"">70</a>].</p>"
"<p>Other psychotherapies aimed at influencing the person with major depressive disorder and helping them modify emotional, cognitive, and behavioral problems were self-efficacy psychotherapy [<a href=""#ref46"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref46"">46</a>]; competitive memory training [<a href=""#ref71"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref71"">71</a>]; guided self-help psychotherapy [<a href=""#ref23"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref23"">23</a>,<a href=""#ref72"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref72"">72</a>]; behavioral activation [<a href=""#ref69"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref69"">69</a>,<a href=""#ref73"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref73"">73</a>]; interpersonal psychotherapy [<a href=""#ref38"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref38"">38</a>,<a href=""#ref57"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref57"">57</a>,<a href=""#ref67"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref67"">67</a>]; psychotherapy focused on problem-solving [<a href=""#ref29"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref29"">29</a>,<a href=""#ref38"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref38"">38</a>,<a href=""#ref74"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref74"">74</a>]; and therapy focused on acceptance, commitment, and emotion [<a href=""#ref62"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref62"">62</a>,<a href=""#ref75"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref75"">75</a>].</p>"
"<p>Leisure time or pleasurable activities as a social practice, contrary to what is often thought, are not only carried out during the summer or on vacation but also in between daily obligations [<a href=""#ref37"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref37"">37</a>]. Thus, they can take the form of individual or group dynamics, whether it is reading a book, listening to music, or going for a walk with friends [<a href=""#ref37"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref37"">37</a>,<a href=""#ref50"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref50"">50</a>]. The relationship between leisure and health has fostered new techniques for the treatment of depressive disorders with the aim of enabling the individual’s psychic and social readaptation [<a href=""#ref37"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref37"">37</a>,<a href=""#ref50"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref50"">50</a>].</p>"
"<p>Painting for leisure, for example, can promote the manifestation of feelings through emotions expressed verbally or not, thus helping understand the mind and its sorrows [<a href=""#ref38"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref38"">38</a>]. In this sense, of the possibilities for leisure activities recommended by the professionals who collaborated with the data found, art therapy [<a href=""#ref40"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref40"">40</a>], group and individual outings [<a href=""#ref41"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref41"">41</a>,<a href=""#ref50"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref50"">50</a>], trips [<a href=""#ref38"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref38"">38</a>], reading books and watching movies [<a href=""#ref37"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref37"">37</a>,<a href=""#ref38"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref38"">38</a>], listening to music [<a href=""#ref31"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref31"">31</a>], and attending religious institutions [<a href=""#ref50"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref50"">50</a>] were the most cited in the studies.</p>"
"<p>In the context of pharmacological treatment, antidepressants associated with psychotherapies [<a href=""#ref26"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref26"">26</a>,<a href=""#ref29"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref29"">29</a>,<a href=""#ref37"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref37"">37</a>] should be administered with caution and under medical supervision [<a href=""#ref20"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref20"">20</a>,<a href=""#ref38"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref38"">38</a>,<a href=""#ref41"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref41"">41</a>] based on the therapeutic alliance, clinical history, monitoring and reassessment of psychiatric conditions, and adequacy of the diagnosis, and guidance should be provided for families [<a href=""#ref28"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref28"">28</a>,<a href=""#ref57"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref57"">57</a>].</p>"
"<p>In 5% (3/62) of the studies, the association of psychotropic drugs with therapeutic guidelines was highlighted (due to the severity of the major depressive disorder clinical picture) even in the face of difficulties with medication adherence for different reasons [<a href=""#ref16"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref16"">16</a>,<a href=""#ref29"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref29"">29</a>,<a href=""#ref38"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref38"">38</a>], which should be anticipated and addressed proactively in every contact with the patient. Approximately 30% to 40% of people using antidepressants still do not respond as expected to treatment [<a href=""#ref27"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref27"">27</a>,<a href=""#ref41"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref41"">41</a>].</p>"
"<p>Relaxation techniques appeared in this review as a more appropriate way of coping with the psychological, environmental, and social stimuli that people with major depressive disorder may face. Among these strategies, breathing techniques [<a href=""#ref16"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref16"">16</a>,<a href=""#ref26"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref26"">26</a>,<a href=""#ref27"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref27"">27</a>,<a href=""#ref29"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref29"">29</a>,<a href=""#ref30"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref30"">30</a>,<a href=""#ref36"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref36"">36</a>], progressive muscle relaxation [<a href=""#ref33"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref33"">33</a>,<a href=""#ref41"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref41"">41</a>,<a href=""#ref66"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref66"">66</a>], massages [<a href=""#ref29"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref29"">29</a>,<a href=""#ref41"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref41"">41</a>,<a href=""#ref66"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref66"">66</a>], stretching [<a href=""#ref16"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref16"">16</a>,<a href=""#ref26"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref26"">26</a>,<a href=""#ref27"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref27"">27</a>,<a href=""#ref29"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref29"">29</a>,<a href=""#ref66"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref66"">66</a>], a warm bath [<a href=""#ref16"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref16"">16</a>], and meditation [<a href=""#ref30"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref30"">30</a>] were the most cited.</p>"
"<p>In the context of major depressive disorder, these techniques promote muscle relaxation, relieve stress and tension, rebalance emotions, produce hormones such as endorphins, provide a sense of well-being, and significantly improve sleep quality [<a href=""#ref16"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref16"">16</a>]. Incorporating these practices throughout the day or even before going to bed helps people let go of tiredness, become aware of the present moment, and pay attention to their own bodies [<a href=""#ref16"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref16"">16</a>,<a href=""#ref66"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref66"">66</a>].</p>"
"<p>Finally, therapeutic guidelines for psychoeducation or professional counseling can be used to help with self-management as major depressive disorder generates changes in the family system and structure [<a href=""#ref16"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref16"">16</a>,<a href=""#ref18"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref18"">18</a>,<a href=""#ref26"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref26"">26</a>,<a href=""#ref36"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref36"">36</a>,<a href=""#ref38"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref38"">38</a>], resulting in the need for clarification to relieve anxieties and doubts to improve the psychological well-being of the patient [<a href=""#ref20"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref20"">20</a>,<a href=""#ref37"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref37"">37</a>,<a href=""#ref42"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref42"">42</a>,<a href=""#ref43"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref43"">43</a>].</p>"
"<p>Thus, the wide variety of therapeutic guidelines found can increase knowledge about the symptoms and aspects of major depressive disorder, allowing the person to self-manage symptoms such as fatigue, sleep disturbances, anhedonia, and mood swings [<a href=""#ref16"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref16"">16</a>,<a href=""#ref27"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref27"">27</a>,<a href=""#ref29"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref29"">29</a>,<a href=""#ref66"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref66"">66</a>] in a more responsible and autonomous way.</p>"
"<p>These therapeutic guidelines are characterized by providing information on the diagnosis, etiology, prognosis, and course of the illness; the identification of early signs of crisis; the importance of adherence to medication or psychosocial treatment; the promotion of healthy habits and regularity in lifestyle (sleep, diet, physical activity, and substance use); and how to deal with the stigmatization, doubts, fears, and myths regarding major depressive disorder [<a href=""#ref23"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref23"">23</a>,<a href=""#ref41"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref41"">41</a>,<a href=""#ref42"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref42"">42</a>].</p>"
"<p>Therefore, the implications for practice are based on the fact that therapeutic guidelines help in the self-management of major depressive disorder through behavioral, social, and emotional changes that allow for better construction of clinical reasoning, adaptation, autonomy, coping, and improvement of general health.</p>"
"<p>The limitations of this scoping review are related to the nature of the review itself as its aim was to provide an overview of therapeutic guidelines, which may not be sufficient for the self-management of major depressive disorder as it is a complex clinical condition with a heterogeneity of symptoms. Furthermore, despite efforts to develop a comprehensive search strategy, it was difficult to find controlled and uncontrolled descriptors for the term “therapeutic guidelines,” which is not an indexed descriptor.</p>"
"<p>By analyzing the methodological approach adopted in this study, and in accordance with the proposed objectives, it was possible to highlight a set of therapeutic guidelines to support a person’s self-management in the context of major depressive disorder symptoms. This does not preclude further study of their effectiveness in the self-management of major depressive disorder symptoms but demonstrates their contribution to promoting self-management of major depressive disorder and their power to prevent possible complications.</p>"
"<p>Self-management is a promising strategy that emphasizes the person’s responsibility in the care process. It goes beyond participation in health care interactions and includes dealing with symptoms and disability; managing medication and monitoring indicators; maintaining adequate levels of nutrition and exercise; and adjusting to psychological, social, and lifestyle demands.</p>"
"<p>These therapeutic guidelines can be applied by all members of a multi-professional mental health team, including nurses, provided they are trained as resources to help the person acquire new knowledge, behaviors, and skills for self-management. These guidelines are also an important resource for health professionals in their role as facilitators of a person’s development of knowledge and skills to ensure their capacity for self-management.</p>"

"<p id=""P3"">The phenomenology and neurobiology of depressive symptoms in anxious youth is poorly understood.</p>"
"<p id=""P4"">Association networks of anxiety and depressive symptoms were developed in adolescents with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD; <em>N</em>=52, mean age: 15.4±1.6 years) who had not yet developed major depressive disorder. Community analyses were used to create consensus clusters of depressive and anxiety symptoms and to identify “bridge” symptoms between the clusters. In a subset of this sample (<em>n=39)</em>, correlations between cortical thickness and depressive symptom severity was examined.</p>"
"<p id=""P5"">Ten symptoms clustered into an anxious community, 5 clustered into a depressive community and 5 bridged the two communities: impaired schoolwork, excessive weeping, low self-esteem, disturbed appetite, and physical symptoms of depression. Patients with more depressive cluster burden had altered cortical thickness in prefrontal, inferior and medial parietal (<em>e.g.</em>, precuneus, supramarginal) regions and had decreases in cortical thickness-age relationships in prefrontal, temporal and parietal cortices.</p>"
"<p id=""P6"">Data are cross-sectional and observational. Limited sample size precluded secondary analysis of comorbidities and demographics.</p>"
"<p id=""P7"">In youth with GAD, a sub-set of symptoms not directly related to anxiety bridge anxiety and depression. Youth with greater depressive cluster burden had altered cortical thickness in cortical structures within the default mode and central executive networks. These alternations in cortical thickness may represent a distinct neurostructural fingerprint in anxious youth with early depressive symptoms. Finally, youth with GAD and high depressive symptoms had reduced age-cortical thickness correlations. The emergence of depressive symptoms in early GAD and cortical development may have bidirectional, neurobiological relationships.</p>"

"<p id=""P8"">Anxiety disorders—which frequently emerge in childhood or adolescence—typically precede the onset of depressive symptoms (<a href=""#R11"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R11"">Bittner et al., 2004</a>) and increase the risk of developing major depressive disorder (MDD) (<a href=""#R7"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R7"">Beesdo et al., 2010</a>). Moreover, anxiety disorders, when they co-occur in depressed youth, increase morbidity and treatment resistance beyond what might be expected with either MDD or an anxiety disorder alone. Indeed, the combination of these disorders increase the likelihood of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts (<a href=""#R37"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R37"">Husky et al., 2012</a>). Yet, little is known regarding: (1) risk factors for developing depressive symptoms in adolescents with anxiety disorders and (2) how features of an anxiety disorders are linked to early depressive symptoms.</p>"
"<p id=""P9"">Prior work demonstrated that anxiety disorders increase the risk of developing depressive disorders. Three reports from the Early Developmental Study of Psychopathology (EDSP) (<a href=""#R87"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R87"">Wittchen et al., 1998</a>) reveal that certain anxiety disorders (<em>i.e.</em>, social anxiety disorder), when present in adolescence, increase the risk of developing MDD in early adulthood (<a href=""#R72"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R72"">Stein et al., 2001</a>). Additional analyses of this sample (<a href=""#R11"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R11"">Bittner et al., 2004</a>) reveal that social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, agoraphobia and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) increase the risk of developing depressive disorders while having multiple anxiety disorders, more severe impairment, comorbid panic attacks specifically contribute to this risk of developing MDD. Interestingly, the severity of anxiety-related impairment represents the strongest independent predictor of developing MDD (OR: 2.2 [95% CI: 1.0 to 4.4]) (<a href=""#R11"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R11"">Bittner et al., 2004</a>). Also in this cohort, more than half of individuals who had social anxiety disorder during adolescence developed MDD during the follow-up period (OR: 3.2 [95% CI: 2.5 to 4.1]) (<a href=""#R5"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R5"">Beesdo et al., 2007</a>) and social anxiety disorder represented the first disorder to emerge in most of these patients. Providing further evidence of the temporal association of depressive and anxiety disorders, the age-of-onset distribution for GAD parallels the age-of-onset distribution for depressive disorders although the age-of-onset distribution for GAD emerges 2 years earlier than that of the depressive disorders (<a href=""#R7"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R7"">Beesdo et al., 2010</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P10"">Studies that examine GAD and MDD as distinct disorders are complicated by diagnostic, phenomenologic, epidemiologic and clinical issues. First, diagnostic criteria for GAD and MDD overlap (<em>e.g.</em>, dyssomnia, fatigue or low energy, and poor concentration). Second, these overlapping symptoms and features such as interference with schoolwork, somatic symptoms and appetite disturbances are assessed in rating scales for both depressive and anxiety disorders (<a href=""#R10"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R10"">Birmaher et al., 1997</a>; <a href=""#R40"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R40"">Isa et al., 2014</a>; <a href=""#R46"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R46"">Kovacs, 1985</a>; <a href=""#R50"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R50"">March et al., 1997</a>; <a href=""#R57"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R57"">Mossman et al., 2017</a>). Third, multiple formulations have been offered to explain this comorbidity. Tyrer, <em>et al</em>, for example, have proposed that MDD and GAD when present concurrently in the same patient should constitute a distinct diagnosis of “cothymia” (<a href=""#R82"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R82"">Tyrer et al., 2001</a>). Indeed, given shared symptoms, genetic risk factors, and psychopharmocologic interventions some have argued MDD and GAD are differing phenotypes of a similar underlying genotype perhaps due to separate environmental triggers (<a href=""#R43"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R43"">Kendler, 1996</a>; <a href=""#R44"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R44"">Kendler et al., 2007</a>; <a href=""#R68"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R68"">Roy et al., 1995</a>). However, more recent studies (<a href=""#R45"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R45"">Kessler et al., 2008</a>) have argued against this conceptualization given each disorder’s distinct risk factors. GAD and MDD share certain risk factors (e.g., childhood adversity and harm avoidance appear) (<a href=""#R7"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R7"">Beesdo et al., 2010</a>; <a href=""#R14"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R14"">Blanco et al., 2014</a>). However, family history of GAD, behavioral inhibition, childhood separation events, and parental overprotection specifically increase the risk of developing anxiety disorders. Likewise, parental depression, low parental emotional warmth, and parental rejection are specifically associated with the development of MDD (<a href=""#R7"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R7"">Beesdo et al., 2010</a>). Finally, a 15 year, longitudinal study of young adults (aged 19-20 years) suggests that anxiety disorders increase the likelihood of developing anxious-depression or depressive disorders (<a href=""#R54"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R54"">Merikangas et al., 2003</a>). Disorder-specific risk was not evaluated (<em>e.g.</em>, unique risk associated with panic disorder <em>vs.</em> generalized anxiety disorder vs. social anxiety disorder).</p>"
"<p id=""P11"">Multiple biological, environmental and social factors influence the complex relationship between depressive and anxiety symptoms during childhood and adolescence. Anxiety symptoms in children (<em>N</em>=2220) who were prospectively followed from late childhood through late adolescence, initially decreased from age 10 until age 12-14 and then increased during mid-to-late adolescence (<a href=""#R83"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R83"">Van Oort et al., 2009</a>). In these adolescents, sex affects anxiety symptom severity and this effect appears to contribute to the severity of depressive symptoms, while time-dependent variability in anxiety and depressive symptoms differ significantly between sexes. Thus, anxiety symptoms appear to predict later depressive symptoms in youth but the mechanism of this phenomenon remains poorly understood (<a href=""#R83"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R83"">Van Oort et al., 2009</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P12"">Few studies have evaluated the neurobiology of depressive symptoms in youth with anxiety disorders. Most prior work in youth has focused on the functional neurocircuitry of either MDD or anxiety disorders. These studies have observed non-disorder specific differences in amygdala activation (i.e., amygdala hyperactivation in both MDD and anxiety disorders), but differences in task-specific amygdala activation in youth with MDD and those with anxiety disorders (<a href=""#R7"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R7"">Beesdo et al., 2009</a>). Additionally, in a sample of youth who were at risk for developing MDD (<em>e.g.</em>, parental history of MDD), (<a href=""#R56"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R56"">Monk et al., 2008</a>) functional differences were observed in the amygdala and nucleus accumbens. However, in this small sample, 59% of the at risk youth had a history of an anxiety disorder; this high prevalence precluded specific examination of the neurofunctional risk contribution of anxiety disorders and the “contribution of anxiety disorders to neural perturbations in at-risk individuals” could not be specifically determined (<a href=""#R56"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R56"">Monk et al., 2008</a>). Neurostructural evaluations of anxious depression are rare in children, despite numerous studies of the neurostructural basis of anxiety disorders and depressive disorders (as separate conditions) (<a href=""#R1"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R1"">Adleman et al., 2012</a>; <a href=""#R32"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R32"">Gold et al., 2016</a>; <a href=""#R58"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R58"">Mueller et al., 2013</a>; <a href=""#R73"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R73"">Strawn et al., 2015</a>, <a href=""#R74"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R74"">2014</a>). In one voxel-based morphometry study of adolescents with anxiety disorders, depressive disorders or anxiety disorders + MDD (anxious depression), adolescents with anxious depression exhibited decreased gray matter volumes in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex compared to patients with MDD alone, while compared to healthy subjects, adolescents with anxious depression had increased gray matter volumes in the pre- and post-central gyri (<a href=""#R84"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R84"">Wehry et al., 2015</a>). To date, no studies have examined the neurobiology of depressive symptoms in youth with anxiety disorders.</p>"
"<p id=""P13"">To explore the relationship between depressive and anxiety symptom clusters, we focused on patients with GAD. The decision to focus on GAD was based on (1) symptomatic distinctiveness of GAD from other anxiety disorders with overlapping symptoms (<a href=""#R16"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R16"">Cho et al., 2019</a>) (2) reliability and validity of the diagnosis in adolescents (<a href=""#R47"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R47"">Lyneham et al., 2007</a>; <a href=""#R64"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R64"">Rappaport et al., 2017</a>); (3) evidence that it is distinct from depressive disorders (<a href=""#R20"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R20"">Cummings et al., 2014</a>); longitudinal stability during childhood, adolescence and early adulthood (<a href=""#R7"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R7"">Beesdo et al., 2010</a>). Beyond this, most <em>DSM-5</em> anxiety disorders in youth have specific foci (<em>e.g.</em>, separation from a primary attachment figure in separation anxiety disorder, fear of humiliation or embarrassment in social anxiety disorder) whereas the anxiety that typifies GAD is diffuse and prototypic of central cognitive aspects of anxiety—“repetitive chains of thoughts about potentially adverse consequences of issues that present with some degree of uncertainty” (<a href=""#R16"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R16"">Cho et al., 2019</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P14"">Although the comorbidity of anxiety disorders and major depression in youth has been extensively studied (<a href=""#R20"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R20"">Cummings et al., 2014</a>), there are substantial knowledge gaps regarding subthreshold depressive symptoms in anxious youth. Identifying specific symptoms that bridge anxiety and depressive disorders in anxious youth, will inform early intervention development and precision medicine approaches. Targeted screening could prevent the development of depressive disorders and decrease the morbidity of anxiety and depressive disorders. With these considerations in mind, we sought to (1) identify predictors of depressive symptoms in adolescents with a primary anxiety disorder; (2) explore potential associations among features of anxiety and depressive symptoms; and (3) examine neurostructural correlates of depressive symptoms in anxious youth.</p>"

"<p id=""P16"">Study participants (<em>N</em>=52) were outpatient youth aged 12 through 17 years who met <em>DSM-IV-TR</em> criteria for GAD, assessed by unstructured and semi-structured assessments by a board-certified child and adolescent psychiatrist (JRS). The diagnosis of GAD was confirmed with the <em>Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM-IV</em> (<em>ADIS-IV</em>) (<a href=""#R71"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R71"">Silverman et al., 2001</a>). We included only patients who met criteria for GAD and excluded patients with MDD or PTSD. Patients treated with psychotropic medications were not included. Patients with active substance abuse or dependence within the past 6 months were excluded and patients had a negative urine drug screen. Data used for this study was extracted from the screening phase of a randomized controlled trial of escitalopram in the treatment of GAD including functional neuroimaging before and during escitalopram treatment. Importantly, not all patient who were screened were randomized. Results and further detail regarding this randomized controlled trial were recently published (<a href=""#R75"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R75"">Strawn et al., 2020</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P17"">Demographic data including age, sex, and race were collected. Additionally, pubertal status was determined using the Duke Self-Rated Tanner Scale (Self Report) (<a href=""#R25"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R25"">Duke et al., 1980</a>). The CGI-S, a clinician-administered instrument of global severity—which is performed by a clinician—is based both on observed and reported symptoms, functional impairment and behavior over a 7 day period (<a href=""#R34"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R34"">Guy, 1976</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P18"">The <em>Children’s Depression Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R)</em> is a 18-item semi-structured, interview-based assessment is commonly employed in clinical research to monitor depressive symptom severity in youth (<a href=""#R66"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R66"">Rintelmann et al., 1996</a>). Each item represents a feature or symptom of depression: <em>(1) impaired schoolwork (difficulty with concentration); (2) difficulty having fun (anhedonia); (3) social withdrawal; (4) sleep disturbance; (5) appetite disturbance; (6) excessive fatigue; (7) physical complaints; (8) irritability; (9) excessive guilt; (10) low self-esteem, (11) depressed mood; (12) morbid ideation; (13) suicidal ideation; (14) excessive weeping; (15) depressed facial affect; (16) listless speech</em> and (17) <em>hypoactivity.</em> These items are rated from 1 to 5 or 1 to 7 (total possible raw score range: 17-113). For the purposes of imaging analysis, we used the CDRS-R to categorize patients into “high” and “low” burdens of depressive symptoms which we defined as CDRS-R score greater than or less than to our sample-specific median, 35.</p>"
"<p id=""P19"">The Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale (PARS), is a clinician-rated instrument that is commonly used in clinical trials of anxious youth, queries anxiety symptoms, severity, and impairment (RUPP, 2002). The PARS consists of 7 sub-scales, each rated 1-5, including: <em>overall number of anxiety symptoms</em> (based on a symptom checklist), <em>overall frequency of anxiety symptoms, overall severity of anxiety feelings, overall severity of physical symptoms of anxiety, overall avoidance of anxiety-provoking situations, interference with family relationships and/or performance at home, and interference with peer and adult relationships and/or performance outside of home</em>.</p>"
"<p id=""P20"">Descriptive statistics were calculated using Microsoft Excel. All statistical analyses were performed in <em>R</em> (version 3.4.2). First, Pearson’s correlation coefficients calculated for each pairwise combination of the following: (1) total PARS score, (2) each PARS item, and (3) each CDRS item. Based on this correlation matrix, association networks were created using <em>qgraph</em> (R package). Each partial correlation coefficient then constituted an “edge” for the association network while each symptom subscale represented a “node.” <em>qgraph</em> uses the Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm (<a href=""#R30"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R30"">Fruchterman and Reingold, 1991</a>), ported from the SNA package (<a href=""#R15"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R15"">Butts, 2010</a>) to create a force-directed layout which clusters correlated nodes and prevents overlapping edges. This algorithm causes all nodes to repulse each other while correlated or connected nodes also attract each other. The result is a representation of the network of symptoms in which highly correlated nodes visually ‘cluster’ together in proportion to their correlational coefficient. We included only edges with partial correlations greater than 0.25, a cutoff used in previous network analyses (<a href=""#R26"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R26"">Epskamp et al., 2018</a>; <a href=""#R41"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R41"">Jones et al., 2018</a>) to limit spurious correlations. Networks were developed to contain (1) PARS and CDRS sub-scales, as well as (2) <em>total</em> PARS score and CDRS sub-scales. A sensitivity analysis examining the associations between age and each node in the association network was performed to assess the impact of age on depressive and anxious symptoms was also performed.</p>"
"<p id=""P21"">We performed a community analysis to assess which anxiety and depressive symptoms formed highly correlated clusters. This approach has been previously used to identify syndromic networks of psychopathology (<a href=""#R67"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R67"">Robinaugh et al., 2014</a>).

Images were acquired with a repetition time (TR) of 6.8 ms, an echo time (TE) of 2.9 ms, a flip angle of 9°; a matrix size of 256 x 256, a field of view of 256×256×160 mm.</p>"
"<p id=""P23"">Initial image processing was completed automatically using FreeSurfer package 6.0.0 (<a href=""http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu"" class=""usa-link usa-link--external"" data-ga-action=""click_feat_suppl"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu</a>). Processing included motion correction, averaging of multiple volumetric T1 weighted images, skull striping using a deformable template model, automated registration to Talairach space, segmentation of subcortical white matter and deep gray matter volumetric structures, normalization of intensity, tessellation of the gray matter, and white matter boundaries, automated topology correction and surface deformation (based on intensity gradients to optimally place the gray/white and gray/cerebrospinal fluid borders) (<a href=""#R27"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R27"">Fischl et al., 2002</a>). The segmentation procedure was visually inspected for inaccuracies (HKS, MJL), and manual corrections were performed as needed by incorporating control points. This was followed by surface inflation and registration to a spherical atlas (based on subject cortical folding patterns) to harmonize the cortical geometry across the patients. The cerebral cortex was subsequently auto-parcellated into 34 different gyral regions per hemisphere using gyral and sulcal anatomy as previously described (<a href=""#R22"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R22"">Desikan et al., 2006</a>). Individual cortical reconstructions were smoothed using a Gaussian kernel of 10mm FWHM and fit to an average subject through recognition of cortical curvature for visualization of results. Differences in cortical thickness, at each vertex of the cortical surface, between groups (see next section) were determined using a general linear model (GLM). This was performed in Freesurfer’s QDEC (Query, Design, Estimate, Contrast) graphic user interface using a cross-subject GLM with a different offset different slope (DODS) design matrix that co-varied for age with gender as a nuisance factor. A vertex-wise threshold of p&lt;0.001 was used and, to correct for multiple comparisons, a Monte Carlo simulation with 10,000 iterations was used to identify findings at a cluster-level significance threshold of 0.05, as previously described (<a href=""#R74"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R74"">Strawn et al., 2014</a>; <a href=""#R78"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R78"">Sylvester et al., 2016</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P24"">To investigate distinct anatomic correlates of depressive symptoms (<em>i.e.</em>, the core depressive symptoms identified in the community analysis), anxious adolescents were divided into 2 groups (“high” and “low” depressive symptoms) based on a core CDRS score greater than or less than 35—the median core CDRS-R score in our sample. These groups were then evaluated with regard to differences in cortical thickness as described in <em>Image Processing.</em> Additionally, to understand the neurodevelopmental effects of depressive symptoms in this age range and given that this period of time—adolescence—represents a critical neurodevelopmental period, we performed a <em>post-hoc</em> analysis of age-cortical thickness relationships in anxious adolescents with high core depressive symptoms and a separate analysis of age-cortical thickness relationship in those with low levels of core depressive symptoms (<em>i.e.</em>, “high” and “low” depressive symptom groups). A dichotomous approach to our analysis was chosen due to concern that a continuous analysis may be more sensitive to multicollinearity given the multidimensionality of our measures, however it should be noted that dichotomization of continuous variables can lead to several disadvantages including decreased power and loss of patient-level information (<a href=""#R48"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R48"">MacCallum et al., 2002</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P25"">Of the 52 patients included in this analysis, 40 were female (76.9%) and 12 were male (23.1%).

The patients were aged 15.4±1.6 years and all patients were post-pubertal (12.2% Tanner 3, 42.9% Tanner 4, 42.9% Tanner 5). Family history was available for 51 of the 52 patients in this study. Among these, many patients had a family history of a first degree relative with an anxiety disorder (66.6%) or with major depressive disorder (37.3%).

Anxiety symptoms were moderate to severe as reflected by a total PARS score of 25.2±3.7 (clinical trial scoring: 19.1±2.7). The average CGI-S score was 4.2 ± 1.0.

"<p id=""P31"">This study is the first to identify a constellation of symptoms that correlatively “bridge” clusters of anxiety and depressive symptoms in adolescents with primary anxiety disorders. Understanding the putative links between clusters of anxiety and depressive symptoms in younger patients provides insights into this relationship <em>before</em> it is modified by the onset of full, syndromic MDD. From a developmental psychopathology standpoint, bridging symptoms (<em>e.g.</em>, excessive weeping, low self-esteem, impaired schoolwork, appetite disturbances, and physical symptoms), early in the course of illness may play critical roles in the pathogenesis of depressive disorders in youth with anxiety disorders and may represent specific treatment targets. Additionally, our findings of two distinct symptom clusters representing anxious and depressive symptoms extend the findings of a longitudinal symptom network study, which focused on a broader and younger population (age 5-14 years) of developing children rather than those with anxiety disorders. In this prior analysis, maternally-reported depressive and anxious symptoms did not form distinct networks and symptoms highly correlated regardless of which diagnostic family to which a symptom belonged (<a href=""#R52"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R52"">McElroy et al., 2018</a>). Taken together with the current findings, clustering of depressive and anxiety symptoms may emerge following the onset of an anxiety disorder.</p>"
"<p id=""P32"">For nearly two centuries, psychiatric diagnoses have been based on the identification of symptom clusters that represent reported and observed symptoms. Within the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5)</em>, (<a href=""#R2"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R2"">American Psychiatric Association, 2013</a>) diagnoses represent the consensus of symptom clusters which represent distinct disorders. This approach represents the backbone of structured diagnostic assessments and the <em>DSM</em>, however, it has been challenged in recent years. The last decade saw dimensional approaches (<em>e.g., Research Domain Criteria [RDoC])</em> to psychiatric illness based on domains and valence which promised to elucidate the pathoetiology of these disorders at genetic, molecular, circuit and behavioral levels (<a href=""#R38"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R38"">Insel, et al., 2010</a>; <a href=""#R39"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R39"">Insel et al., 2015</a>). Although both RDoC and cluster-based (i.e., conventional) constructs classify psychiatric illnesses based on empirical data, cluster-based approaches focus on reported symptoms (<em>e.g.</em> excessive guilt or anhedonia) or observed signs (<em>e.g.</em>, psychomotor retardation or agitation). By contrast, RDoC focuses on “dimensions of <em>observable</em> behavior and neurobiological measures” with little attention given to subjective experience of patients (<a href=""#R21"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R21"">Cuthbert, 2015</a>). Implementation of such construct-based based on specific domains (<em>i.e.</em>, RDoC approaches) raises concerns with regard to (1) underlying developmental processes, (2) classification of specific disorders within a dimensional framework, (3) shared symptoms as well as circuits (<a href=""#R28"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R28"">Franklin et al., 2015</a>). Additionally, some argued that RDoC approaches are problematic an create biological reductionism (<a href=""#R28"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R28"">Franklin et al., 2015</a>). Regardless of whether neurobiologically based constructs such as RDoC or a symptom-focused cluster-based construct are preferred, it is imperative that both the unique symptomatology of disorders in youth and symptoms linking comorbid diagnoses are considered in research settings and in the clinic.</p>"
"<p id=""P33"">The analyses presented herein suggest the validity of cluster-based constructs. Specifically, we observed that patients with predominantly anxiety-related symptoms included all seven PARS items as well as dysomnia and fatigue whereas a second group featured predominantly of depression-related symptoms and included listless speech, depressed affect, hypoactivity, depressed mood, and anhedonia. The symptoms in the depressive cluster are specific for depression and include anhedonia and depressed mood—core depressive symptoms. Within the depressive cluster, anhedonia is the only directly linked symptom to the anxiety cluster (through anxiety-related distress). Given the link between anxiety-related distress and anhedonia (but not depressed mood), the emergence of anhedonia in anxious youth may be a more sensitive risk marker for developing MDD than depressed mood. This finding is consistent with lower animal studies in which chronic stress reduces dopamine release in response to pleasurable stimuli (<a href=""#R23"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R23"">Di Chiara et al., 1999</a>) and decreases engagement in pleasurable activities (<a href=""#R60"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R60"">Papp et al., 1991</a>; <a href=""#R81"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R81"">Treadway and Zald, 2011</a>). Therefore, a treatment focusing on discriminating between rewarding and non-rewarding behaviors, such as behavioral activation, may be useful in preventing the development of depression in at-risk anxious youth (<a href=""#R81"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R81"">Treadway and Zald, 2011</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P34"">We identified five symptoms that bridge depression and anxiety clusters (low self-esteem, impaired schoolwork, appetite disturbances, physical symptoms of depression (CDRS-R) and excessive weeping). Some of these symptoms (<em>e.g.</em>, self-esteem and excessive weeping) represent sequelae of anxiety (<em>e.g.</em>, crying in times of severe anxiety or when experiencing anxiety-related distress when being overwhelmed by anxiety, etc.). Additionally, some bridging symptoms reflect functional impairment (<em>e.g.</em>, impaired schoolwork) and could be attributed to either the anxiety disorder or to an emerging depressive disorder. To this end, both severe anxious symptoms and emerging depressive symptoms could result in poor schoolwork but would not necessarily be due to the same underlying symptoms or disease process. Specific bridge symptoms (<em>e.g.</em>, impaired schoolwork) may lend themselves to specific intervention (<em>i.e.</em>, increased educational support and accommodations). Many of these symptoms can be recognized and reported by family members (<em>e.g.</em>, appetite disturbances, excessive weeping, impaired schoolwork) and thus, clinicians might increase vigilance in monitoring these specific symptoms with the hopes that early identification could forestall the development of MDD. Finally, the bridging role of physical symptoms which represent somatic manifestations of internalizing disorders in pediatric populations (<a href=""#R9"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R9"">Bernstein et al., 1997</a>; <a href=""#R18"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R18"">Crawley et al., 2014</a>; <a href=""#R31"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R31"">Ginsburg et al., 2006</a>), may reflect a shared neurobiologic/psychological etiology. Specifically, in patients with anxiety disorders and in those with depressive disorders, neurostructural and neurofunctional abnormalities in the anterior insula and salience network have been described (<a href=""#R17"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R17"">Craig, 2009</a>; <a href=""#R61"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R61"">Peters et al., 2016</a>). This network processes interoceptive information and somatic afferent signals and the processing of this information is disrupted in both anxiety and depressive disorders. Whether altered interoceptive processing represents a specific endophenotype of youth with anxiety or depressive disorders remains to be determined. At this time, the relationship between abnormal interoceptive functioning and high somatic symptom burden in individuals with anxiety disorders and those who develop depressive symptoms represents a significant void in our understanding of the relationship between anxiety and depression. Importantly, although comorbidities and family history were not significantly related to bridge symptoms, these results should be interpreted with caution given our limited power to detect these differences. Further research with larger samples is needed to elucidate the relationship between genetic loading and various comorbidities and symptoms bridging anxious and depressive symptom clusters.</p>"
"<p id=""P35"">Social withdrawal, a symptom found in our anxiety cluster, is the starting point for a bridge to our depressive cluster (specifically, depressed mood and depressed affect). That social withdrawal begins a cascade leading to depressive symptoms is consistent with previous observations that more than half of patients with social anxiety disorder in childhood or adolescence later develop MDD (<a href=""#R5"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R5"">Beesdo et al., 2007</a>). Importantly, the correlation between social withdrawal and depressed mood and affect is not direct, but rather linked through low self-esteem and excessive weeping. We postulate that future longitudinal studies will find these linking symptoms to precede more frank and specific signs of MDD (<em>i.e.</em>, anhedonia and depressed mood). Further, by addressing low self-esteem, specifically in adolescents with anxiety-related social withdrawal we may thwart the development of depressive disorders in youth with primary anxiety disorders. Similarly, disturbed sleep clustered with other anxiety-related symptoms but form the start point to a bridge to anhedonia, a depressive-cluster symptom. Previous studies have found that sleep deprivation can confer greater risk for psychopathology and medical illness in adolescents and may portend poorer outcomes irrespective of diagnoses (<a href=""#R59"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R59"">Owens, 2014</a>). For this reason, researchers have begun targeting sleep from a transdiagnostic perspective (<a href=""#R24"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R24"">Dong et al., 2020</a>) which could be particularly useful in youth with mixed depressive and anxious symptoms.</p>"
"<p id=""P36"">In anxious adolescents with more depressive symptoms, abnormalities were observed in key cognitive networks including the salience, default mode and ventral attention networks. These three networks have been associated with the pathophysiology of anxiety disorders but also the pathophysiology of depressive disorders in adults and in pediatric populations (<a href=""#R86"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R86"">Williams, 2016</a>). Thus, cortical abnormalities in these regions likely relate to shared cognitive processes and functions. First, we observed cortical thickness differed in the salience network (<em>i.e.</em>, cingulo-opercular network) and specifically within the bilateral superior frontal, left insula, bilateral supramarginal cortex. This network putatively processes negative affect, pain, and cognitive control, (<a href=""#R69"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R69"">Seminowicz et al., 2007</a>; <a href=""#R70"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R70"">Shackman et al., 2011</a>) functions that are shared by both depressive and anxiety disorders. Second, we observed differences in cortical thickness in the bilateral precuneus and cuneus, as well as the bilateral inferior temporal, right posterior cingulate, right medial frontal, left superior temporal cortices. These regions collectively belong to the default mode network which has been implicated in the pathophysiology of both anxiety and depressive disorders (<a href=""#R36"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R36"">Ho et al., 2015</a>; <a href=""#R53"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R53"">McVoy et al., 2019</a>) in children and adolescents. It should be noted that within our sample anxious adolescents with high depressive symptom burden showed relative increased and decreases in cortical thickness contingent on specific foci involved. It has been hypothesized that depressive and anxiety disorder are the result of abnormal trajectories of childhood brain development (<a href=""#R4"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R4"">Bale et al., 2010</a>; <a href=""#R38"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R38"">Insel et al., 2010</a>). Early adolescence is a major period of brain development that is characterized by dynamic structural and functional brain maturation as well as reorganization. While the specific cellular and molecular changes underlying these developmental changes are unknown, likely mechanisms include increasing myelination and axon caliber, pruning and synaptogenesis which have variable importance relative to age and neuroanatomical region (<a href=""#R8"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R8"">Benes et al., 1994</a>; <a href=""#R80"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R80"">Tamnes et al., 2017</a>). These factors ultimately result in region-specific cortical thickness and surface area changes that are likely result from a complex interplay of age, sex, genetic and environmental factors (<a href=""#R55"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R55"">Mills et al., 2014</a>; <a href=""#R85"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R85"">Whitaker et al., 2016</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P37"">Within the default mode network, previous work has examined functional connectivity in patients who were at high and low risk for developing depressive and anxiety disorders and observed that children who are at high risk (based on the presence of behavioral inhibition) have decreased default mode network connectivity, although salience network connectivity did not differ between the two groups (<a href=""#R29"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R29"">Bellgowan et al., 2015</a>). Taken together with the current findings, these results raise the possibility that structural and functional abnormalities within these networks may be related. Additionally, the two regions within the ventral and dorsal attention networks (bilateral interior and superior parietal cortex) differed between those patients with and without high levels of depressive symptoms. Within this network, resting state functional connectivity differs between those youth 8-12 years of age with a history of anxiety or depressive disorders and healthy, age-matched youth (<a href=""#R77"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R77"">Sylvester et al., 2013</a>). Further, these networks may already exhibit distinct connectivity patterns in infants who are at risk for developing depressive disorders (<a href=""#R79"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R79"">Sylvester et al., 2018</a>)—which typically precede the development of anxiety disorders (<a href=""#R3"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R3"">Asselmann et al., 2014</a>; <a href=""#R62"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R62"">Pine et al., 1998</a>) suggesting the neurobiological underpinnings of anxiety and depressive disorders may far precede clinical manifestations of illness. Although functional connectivity analyses are beyond the scope of the present study, processing of fMRI data in this sample before and during treatment as part of a larger randomized control trial is ongoing (<a href=""http://clinicaltrials.gov"" class=""usa-link"" data-ga-action=""click_feat_suppl"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">clinicaltrials.gov</a>, <a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02818751"" class=""usa-link"" data-ga-action=""click_feat_suppl"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">NCT02818751</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P38"">Finally, in our <em>post-hoc</em> examination of cortical thickness-age relationships, anxious adolescents with more depressive symptoms had thicker cortices than expected for their age in many of the same structures within with salience, default mode, and ventral attention networks. During adolescence, these regions typically undergo pruning (<a href=""#R12"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R12"">Blakemore, 2008</a>; <a href=""#R13"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R13"">Blakemore et al., 2006</a>) although environmental factors can alter network connectivity in these regions during childhood and early adolescence (<a href=""#R65"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R65"">Rebello et al., 2018</a>). Importantly, neurostructural changes (<em>e.g.</em>, changes in cortical thickness, synaptic pruning, and myelination) impact network dynamics (<a href=""#R35"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R35"">He et al., 2007</a>; <a href=""#R76"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R76"">Sur et al., 2005</a>) and likewise network dynamics can modify the physical structure of a network (<a href=""#R42"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R42"">Katz et al., 1996</a>; <a href=""#R49"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R49"">Majewska et al., 2006</a>). The aberrancies in cortical thickness-age relationship that we observed could suggest delayed cortical maturation (<em>ie</em>, slowed cortical migration or pruning) in anxious adolescents who develop more severe depressive symptoms. This delay in cortical maturation could then disrupt network connectivity and pathogenically contribute to depressive symptoms in anxious adolescents.</p>"
"<p id=""P39"">The present article has important limitations. First, our data are observational and cross-sectional. We cannot comment on the time course of the development of these depressive symptoms or predict in which patients these depressive symptoms will indeed later present as full MDD. Second, our sample size is relatively small, which increases the risk of Type II error. Third, whether these individuals go on to develop MDD or continue to experience persistent levels of depressive symptoms remains to be determined. Fourth, the primary rating scales used in this study (<em>ie</em>, CDRS-R and PARS) were developed to characterize symptoms as they relate to depressive and anxiety disorders, respectively. Network clustering of one scale’s items with other items on the same scale could be due to biased terminology used in the rating scale rather than unbiased appraisal of a given symptom. For example, the CDRS-R defines severely “impaired schoolwork” as “no motivation to perform” which implies impaired schoolwork is related to an amotivational state rather than avoidance or poor concentration due to anxiety (<a href=""#R51"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R51"">Mayes et al., 2010</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P40"">While these cross-sectional analyses cannot causally link anxiety and depressive symptoms nor can they establish that anxiety-cluster symptoms predate depression-cluster symptoms, our findings are consistent with several lines of evidence concerning the relationship between anxiety and depression. First, anxiety disorders typically precede depressive disorders in youth (<a href=""#R5"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R5"">Beesdo et al., 2007</a>; <a href=""#R11"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R11"">Bittner et al., 2004</a>). Second, our patients’ primary diagnosis of GAD, rather than MDD, makes these bridge symptoms areas of interest for further, longitudinal studies in the pathogenesis of MDD in anxious adolescents. Third, the clustering of classically depression-related symptoms (<em>e.g.</em>, social withdrawal, poor sleep, and fatigue) within our anxious cluster underscores their poor specificity for depression; they may not constitute true “bridge” symptoms. Further, these three symptoms do not directly correlate with either core depression symptom (<em>i.e.</em>, anhedonia and depressed mood) in our association network. Therefore, in the case of youth with anxiety disorders, these three symptoms can arise solely due to the anxiety disorder and should not be seen as evidence of an emerging depressive disorder.</p>"
"<p id=""P41"">Anxiety and depressive symptoms form distinct clusters in adolescents with primary anxiety disorders who do not meet criteria for MDD. These clusters mirror groupings in common assessment instruments (<em>i.e.</em>, CDRS-R and PARS) for youth with anxiety or depression; however, some key symptoms (<em>e.g.</em>, excessive weeping, low self-esteem, impaired schoolwork, appetite disturbances, physical symptoms) fail to cluster within either the anxiety or depressive cluster and form correlative links between anxious and depressive clusters. These “bridge” symptoms may be important in the pathogenesis of depressive disorders in anxious youth. Further, adolescents with GAD and high depressive symptom burden show specific changes in default mode and central executive networks which may serve as a neurostructural fingerprint in anxious youth with early depressive symptoms. Moreover, these same youth have reduced age-cortical thickness correlations relative to anxious youth with low depressive symptom burden suggesting the emergence of depressive symptoms in early GAD and cortical development may have bidirectional, neurobiological relationships. Finally, longitudinal studies are needed to explore the development of depression in anxious youth.</p>"
