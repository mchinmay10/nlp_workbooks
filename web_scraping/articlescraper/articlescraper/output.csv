"<p>In the prodromal phase of schizophrenia, severe alterations of the visual appearance of the environment have been found, accompanied by a state of intense anxiety. The present study considers the possibility that these alterations really exist in the appearance of objects, but that healthy people do not see them. The image of the world that we see is continuously deformed and fragmented by foreshortenings, partial overlapping, and so on and must be constantly reassembled and interpreted; otherwise, it could change so much that we would hardly recognize it. Since pleasure has been found to be involved in visual and cognitive information processing, the possibility is considered that anhedonia (the reduction of the ability to feel pleasure) might interfere with the correct reconstruction and interpretation of the image of the environment and alter its appearance. The possibility is also considered that these alterations might make the environment hostile, might at times evoke the sensation of being trapped by a predator, and might be the cause of the anxiety that accompanies them. According to some authors, they might also induce delusional ideas, in an attempt to restore meaning in a world that has become chaotic and frightening. </p>"
"<p>The prodromal phase of schizophrenia refers to the early signs and symptoms that precede the clear manifestation of the illness. It begins when the first alterations of the mood or behavior are noticed and ends with the onset of frank psychotic symptoms [<a href=""#B1"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B1"">1</a>]. This period, which can last days, months, or years, is characterized by heterogeneous and nonspecific symptoms which may include, among others, depressive and anxious symptoms as well as attenuated psychotic symptoms [<a href=""#B1"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B1"">1</a>].</p>"
"<p>Towards the middle of the last century Conrad, director of the University Psychiatric Hospital in Göttingen, found that in the prodromal phase of schizophrenia severe alterations in the perception and organization of sensory information are present, accompanied by intense anxiety, and he expounded the theory that schizophrenia may be caused by a perceptual disorder and that the delusional ideas may be an attempt to give meaning to a world that has become incomprehensible on account of the perceptual disorder [<a href=""#B2"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B2"">2</a>]. Cutting and Dunne confirmed the frequency and the severity of disturbances of visual perception in the prodromal phase of schizophrenia. All the patients interviewed reported that at the beginning of the illness the shapes of objects appeared profoundly changed: “there is an undoubted and dramatic change in the way they [the patients] perceive the world” [<a href=""#B3"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B3"">3</a>, p. 230]. Their accounts agree with those supplied by Conrad's patients, for whom “familiar things, whose authenticity would never have been doubted, are not recognized, they are rejected as something extraneous or, at least, they appear to be singularly modified” [<a href=""#B2"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B2"">2</a>, p. 100]. According to Cutting and Dunne, the most plausible psychological theory concerning the cause of schizophrenia is a “break-down in Gestalt” [<a href=""#B3"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B3"">3</a>, p. 230]. (Gestalt in German means shape, form, but also, as in this case, the percept of something as a hole beyond its individual parts: a “minimum cohesive pattern” according to the definition of Muth et al. [<a href=""#B4"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B4"">4</a>, p. 1].)</p>"
"<p>Cutting sums up Conrad's thought as follows: “In the first phase, which he [Conrad] called the<em> trema</em>, because of the accompanying mood of terror, the ability to form a Gestalt is disintegrated” and in the next phase the patient “attaches new meanings to the change, and these new beliefs are what the observer calls delusions. Delusions, for Conrad, are not therefore abnormal in themselves, which is the traditional view of schizophrenia, from Jaspers onward. They are the normal responses of anyone whose perceptual world has been degraded in this dramatic way” [<a href=""#B5"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B5"">5</a>, p. 430].</p>"
"<p>In a research in 1966, Chapman confirmed Conrad's observations, both on the alterations of the appearance of the environment and on the presence of intense anxiety in the initial phase of schizophrenia, and considered anxiety a consequence of the visual alterations. The visual alterations that Chapman found consisted initially of changes of colour and contrast (contrast: difference in brightness or colour between various shapes), which could also be pleasant, but “as the breakdown in visual perception progresses, and as other disturbances in perceptions and cognitions develop, this early reaction changed to one of intense anxiety” [<a href=""#B6"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B6"">6</a>, p. 240].</p>"
"<p>The presence of anxiety at the beginning of schizophrenia, pointed out by Conrad and by Chapman, has been verified by other researchers [<a href=""#B7"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B7"">7</a>]. There is a close relationship between anxiety and schizophrenia. Anxiety often precedes [<a href=""#B7"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B7"">7</a>–<a href=""#B12"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B12"">12</a>] and accompanies [<a href=""#B13"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B13"">13</a>, <a href=""#B14"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B14"">14</a>] schizophrenia and is one of its risk factors [<a href=""#B9"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B9"">9</a>, <a href=""#B15"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B15"">15</a>]. Longitudinal studies have shown that anxiety precedes paranoia, and this seems to exclude the possibility that paranoid ideas can be the cause of the anxiety that accompanies schizophrenia [<a href=""#B7"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B7"">7</a>, <a href=""#B16"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B16"">16</a>].</p>"
"<p>A possible relationship between disturbances in the perception of the aspect of the environment and anxiety seems understandable, since an unexplainable alteration of forms such as that found at the beginning of schizophrenia could render the environment different and unknown, and this might justify the onset of an anxious state. For example, an unknown environment is used as a stimulus to cause anxiety in experiments on animals [<a href=""#B17"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B17"">17</a>, <a href=""#B18"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B18"">18</a>], and it is sufficient to provoke a dramatic [<a href=""#B19"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B19"">19</a>] increase of anxiety. Moreover, distortions of the visual aspect of objects could make the environment not only new, but also inexplicably deformed, and for that reason all the more dangerous and frightening.</p>"
"<p>The visual deformations could be caused by visual defects, and many visual defects, the best known of which is a reduced sensitivity to contrast, have been found in schizophrenia [<a href=""#B20"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B20"">20</a>]. However it is not clear whether these defects, identifiable only through particular tests of the eyesight and present also in patients with only depressive disturbances [<a href=""#B21"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B21"">21</a>, <a href=""#B22"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B22"">22</a>], can go so far as to cause the serious deformations of the form of objects reported by the patients of Conrad, Chapman, and Cutting and Dunne (for a recent review of the literature on perceptive alterations in schizophrenia and in its prodromal phase, see Silverstein 2016 [<a href=""#B23"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B23"">23</a>]).</p>"
"<p>However, perhaps it is not necessary for the visual deformations to be caused exclusively by visual problems: perhaps the images we see are in reality already deformed; only we do not normally notice it. In fact, the image of the world we receive through what we see has to be continuously reassembled and reorganized; otherwise it could become distorted and fragmented and could change so much that we would hardly recognize it. According to Muth et al., for example, “our perceptual impressions of an object and its context are in permanent flux as we move or as the object moves or transforms itself: the (perceived) world is not static but permanently physically changing” [<a href=""#B24"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B24"">24</a>, p. 2]. We must immediately realize that foreshortening is not a real deformation, that an object that is partially hidden is not cut off but extends under the cover, that a cloud seen through the branches of a tree is not part of the tree, and so on. For example, every time we look at a three-dimensional object from a different angle: “the observer should be expected to see an object of changing shape. The cube should undergo constant amoebic transformations … Fortunately, but surprisingly enough, this does not happen.” [<a href=""#B25"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B25"">25</a>, p. 71]. However, perhaps this might happen if something interferes with the mechanism of the indispensable continuous reorganization and interpretation of an “amoebic” reality. In this case, the alterations might become evident, objects might seem deformed and frightening, sky and clouds might seem head-spinningly close to the observer, making the surrounding world flat and oppressive, and so on.</p>"
"<p>Even in a person without psychiatric pathologies, the sudden awareness of a deformation of the appearance of the environment, deformation that had always been present but had previously been ignored, may give rise to intense anxiety. An example of this can be found in<em> Art and Visual Perception</em>, a book by Arnheim, former president of the Division on Psychology and the Arts of the American Psychological Association, where the author describes the distressed reaction of a student when, following a suggestion by the teacher, she became aware of the deformations assumed by the appearance of an object according to the viewpoint from which it was observed, deformations which she had always corrected automatically without realizing it. “It is very difficult for many persons to visualize the working of perspective, even when it is demonstrated to them with a yardstick. Recently an intelligent and sensitive young college student, to whom I tried to show the oblique shape of a box on the table, finally hid her face in sudden terror and exclaimed, ‘It is true - how horrible!'” [<a href=""#B25"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B25"">25</a>, p. 160]. And in the case reported by Arnheim it was only a completely explainable alteration of the appearance of a single small object.</p>"
"<p>One of the possible factors that might interfere with the indispensable and continuous reconstruction of the world could be anhedonia. Anhedonia has been considered a core symptom of schizophrenia [<a href=""#B26"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B26"">26</a>, <a href=""#B27"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B27"">27</a>] and often precedes [<a href=""#B28"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B28"">28</a>–<a href=""#B30"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B30"">30</a>] and predicts [<a href=""#B11"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B11"">11</a>] the disorder. Anhedonia is also present in persons with a high risk of schizophrenia [<a href=""#B11"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B11"">11</a>, <a href=""#B31"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B31"">31</a>].</p>"
"<p>Pleasure has recently been subdivided into pleasure felt in the moment, or consummatory pleasure, and future or anticipatory pleasure [<a href=""#B32"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B32"">32</a>–<a href=""#B34"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B34"">34</a>]. Numerous studies indicate that in schizophrenia anhedonia concerns especially, or only, future pleasures [<a href=""#B35"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B35"">35</a>–<a href=""#B37"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B37"">37</a>]. Consummatory and anticipatory pleasure are, respectively, connected to the liking and wanting of the reward model suggested by Berridge and Robinson [<a href=""#B38"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B38"">38</a>] and it has been proposed that dopamine is more involved in the wanting process, while opioids are more involved in the liking process [<a href=""#B38"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B38"">38</a>]. However, the action of dopamine and that of opioids are closely interwoven and overlapped, since dopamine releases endogenous opioids [<a href=""#B39"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B39"">39</a>, <a href=""#B40"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B40"">40</a>], while the opioids in turn release dopamine in the nucleus accumbens [<a href=""#B41"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B41"">41</a>, <a href=""#B42"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B42"">42</a>]. In this chain of interconnections between dopamine and endogenous opioids, some authors believe that dopamine could be the “basic link” [<a href=""#B43"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B43"">43</a>]. Besides, anhedonia regarding in-the-moment pleasures has also been found in schizophrenia, both for pleasures in general [<a href=""#B34"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B34"">34</a>, <a href=""#B44"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B44"">44</a>, <a href=""#B45"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B45"">45</a>] and for only some of them such as unexpected pleasures [<a href=""#B46"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B46"">46</a>], social pleasures [<a href=""#B47"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B47"">47</a>–<a href=""#B49"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B49"">49</a>], and the pleasure of odours [<a href=""#B26"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B26"">26</a>, <a href=""#B50"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B50"">50</a>]. It has also been proposed that, in schizophrenia, anhedonia for in-the-moment pleasures may vary according to the type of pleasant sensation involved [<a href=""#B51"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B51"">51</a>].</p>"
"<p>Anhedonia is also present in anxiety [<a href=""#B52"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B52"">52</a>–<a href=""#B55"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B55"">55</a>]. Its presence in both schizophrenia and anxiety could be because both the former [<a href=""#B56"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B56"">56</a>–<a href=""#B60"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B60"">60</a>] and the latter [<a href=""#B61"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B61"">61</a>, <a href=""#B62"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B62"">62</a>] are induced by stress, and stress is regularly accompanied and followed by anhedonia in both man [<a href=""#B63"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B63"">63</a>–<a href=""#B68"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B68"">68</a>] and animals [<a href=""#B65"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B65"">65</a>, <a href=""#B66"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B66"">66</a>].</p>"
"<p>Anhedonia might possibly accompany stress because the loss of the pleasure of aiming for a goal and achieving it (including defending oneself and escaping from a danger) could lead to immobility, and immobility offers the extreme chance of safety when an animal is facing the worst possible stressful situation—being seized by a predator—as in this case any movement can further stimulate the predator's aggressiveness. It also might discourage devouring, since many predators are reluctant to eat the flesh of animals that have been dead for some time [<a href=""#B69"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B69"">69</a>], and the immobility that occurs when at the mercy of a predator is tonic (hence the term tonic immobility, or playing dead), that is, as rigid as an animal a few hours after death. Also rigidity might be influenced or caused by anhedonia, since the relaxation of the antagonist muscles coinciding with the action of the agonist muscles (a relaxation indispensable for each fluid movement whether active or passive) is linked to the ability to feel the pleasure connected to the movement [<a href=""#B70"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B70"">70</a>]. Tonic immobility might be connected to catatonia [<a href=""#B71"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B71"">71</a>], the inability to move and speak sometimes seen in serious depression and schizophrenia [<a href=""#B71"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B71"">71</a>, <a href=""#B72"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B72"">72</a>], but that can even happen to mentally sane people when they realize that death (the predator they can no longer evade) is imminent and inevitable [<a href=""#B71"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B71"">71</a>].</p>"
"<p>Some hormones are released during intense or repeated stress: adrenalin and noradrenaline which help to combat stress by increasing the flow of blood and glucose to the muscles and the brain; corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) which provokes the release of cortisone, the action of which accompanies and reinforces that of adrenalin and noradrenaline. The CRH also releases another hormone, dynorphin [<a href=""#B73"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B73"">73</a>–<a href=""#B75"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B75"">75</a>], which activates <em>κ</em> opioid receptors (KORs) in the central and peripheral nervous system. Dynorphin reduces the release of dopamine [DA] in the nucleus accumbens [<a href=""#B76"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B76"">76</a>, <a href=""#B77"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B77"">77</a>]. The dopamine released in the nucleus accumbens is the basis for generating pleasure [<a href=""#B78"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B78"">78</a>, <a href=""#B79"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B79"">79</a>], so that stress can reduce the ability to perceive pleasure by reducing dopamine through the action of dynorphin. On account of its ability to cause anhedonia, dynorphin has been considered to be responsible for depression due to stress [<a href=""#B80"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B80"">80</a>].</p>"
"<p>Dynorphin also causes anxiety [<a href=""#B75"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B75"">75</a>]. Its anxiogenic effect has not been considered in relation to anhedonia but has been considered a consequence of a direct action of dynorphin on the anxiogenic centres (in particular on the amygdala, through <em>κ</em> opioid receptors present in the amygdala) [<a href=""#B73"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B73"">73</a>]. However, some authors leave the possibility open that anhedonia could intervene in the pathogenesis of anxiety: “Given the high comorbidity of depressive and anxiety disorders, KOR signalling and control of DA function may underlie the pathogenesis of both” [<a href=""#B81"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B81"">81</a>, p. 442]. Besides, “recently, two lines of mice with mutations in the <em>κ</em> opioid receptor system were generated. One is a constitutive <em>κ</em> opioid receptor knockout (KOR<sup>−/−</sup>), the other is a conditional knockout (DAT-KOR<sub>lox/lox</sub>) in which <em>κ</em> opioid receptors are lacking in DA-containing neurons. Behavioral characterization demonstrated that DAT-KOR<sub>lox/lox</sub> mice displayed reduced anxiety-like behaviors in the open field and light/dark box tests. These findings suggest that the activation of <em>κ</em> opioid receptors in the mesocorticolimbic DA system plays a key role in anxiety” [<a href=""#B82"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B82"">82</a>, p. 785-786]. It is perhaps worth considering the possibility that a possible direct action of dynorphin on the anxiogenic centres may be accompanied by an indirect anxiogenic action mediated by the anhedonic effect of dynorphin. However, how could anhedonia arouse anxiety, that is, arouse an inexplicable fear of a grave imminent and unknown danger?</p>"
"<p>According to many researchers, our capacity to feel pleasure can influence our ability to perceive and link sensory information and the ability to learn. For example, in animals, when two separate stimuli, which individually do not provoke pleasure, are mentally connected to each other, the formation of this new bond causes pleasure, and this is considered important for learning in general [<a href=""#B83"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B83"">83</a>, <a href=""#B84"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B84"">84</a>]. In man, satisfying a curiosity is pleasant [<a href=""#B85"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B85"">85</a>], just as it is pleasant to grasp an inner meaning [<a href=""#B86"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B86"">86</a>], and the pleasure connected to awaiting a novelty (novelties are pleasant [<a href=""#B87"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B87"">87</a>]) facilitates learning [<a href=""#B88"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B88"">88</a>].</p>"
"<p>As regards the visual aspect in particular, recognizing an expected image gives pleasure, and if the image is unexpected the pleasure is even greater [<a href=""#B89"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B89"">89</a>]. Recognizing a shape in an ambiguous context gives pleasure [<a href=""#B86"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B86"">86</a>], and this stimulates us to look for other ambiguous shapes to discover their correct shape [<a href=""#B24"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B24"">24</a>]. Getting rid of visual ambiguity gives pleasure in the same way as escaping a danger [<a href=""#B90"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B90"">90</a>], and visual learning is also facilitated by a simultaneous pleasure, even if this pleasure is completely extraneous to vision [<a href=""#B91"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B91"">91</a>].</p>"
"<p>Anhedonia, both consummatory and anticipatory, could reduce these pleasures and therefore interfere with the correct processing of visual sensations. According to Der-Avakian et al., “if an individual is unable to derive pleasure from a normally rewarding activity or from anticipation of that activity, then it is unlikely that the individual will be motivated to pursue that activity” [<a href=""#B92"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B92"">92</a>, p. 245]. It therefore seems possible that, in the case of anhedonia, the spur to perceive, link, and interpret all the unceasing new and different aspects of what we see (e.g., understanding that foreshortening does not imply deformation of the whole object but just depends on the viewer's angle) might be weaker, or be lacking. In this case, the usual appearance of objects may change, and various degrees of alteration of the aspect of the environment might result.</p>"
"<p>If this happens, then perhaps even just a very brief, but unexpected and inexplicable, deformation of some aspect of the environment might give in some cases the sensation that the apparent normality of the objects is only a fragile veil, which could be torn and reveal inexplicable and frightening deformities. Even just the vague feeling that this might happen might induce indefinable, inexpressible fear of imminent catastrophe, generating a state of anxiety, the cause of which cannot be explained to other people because the sufferers cannot explain it to themselves. Moreover, to provoke a reaction of fear or anxiety it is not necessary to be aware that one has seen a danger: the danger can influence behaviour also if seen only subliminally, unconsciously [<a href=""#B93"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B93"">93</a>–<a href=""#B95"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B95"">95</a>]; indeed, if a stimulus has been perceived unconsciously, the subsequent defence reactions may be stronger than when it is perceived consciously [<a href=""#B96"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B96"">96</a>, <a href=""#B97"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B97"">97</a>].</p>"
"<p>Close correspondences have been found between anxious reactions in anxiety disorders and the reactions of defence against a predator [<a href=""#B98"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B98"">98</a>–<a href=""#B100"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B100"">100</a>]. However, in anxiety disorders, since the predator does not exist, these defensive reactions would be unjustified and aberrant [<a href=""#B99"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B99"">99</a>, <a href=""#B100"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B100"">100</a>]. However, perhaps it is possible that, even in the absence of a real predator and excluding hallucinations, if certain facilitating external circumstances occur (e.g., stressful experiences with consequent serious anhedonia) a healthy person could in any time and unexpectedly feel faced with a predator. In fact, in man it is sufficient to feel cornered and with no possibility of escape for extreme defence reflexes to be triggered that occur when one is seized by a predator [<a href=""#B69"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B69"">69</a>], and a deformed environment not only can be felt hostile but takes away any possibility of finding a refuge; in addition any loss of the ability to see depth would prevent seeing an escape route. In this case, inexplicable environmental deformations could be equivalent to a very close and inescapable predator and the apparently aberrant defensive reactions of people with anxiety disorders could be justified.</p>"
"<p>Recently, concepts similar to Conrad's concerning delusional ideas (i.e., that they are an attempt to restore meaning in a chaotic, frightening word) have been expressed by various authors. According to Freeman et al., for example, “it is hypothesized that individuals prone to paranoid ideation are trying to make sense of feelings of oddness caused by internal anomalies (e.g. hallucinations, perceptual anomalies, arousal).” [<a href=""#B101"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B101"">101</a>, p. 1122], and according to Marwaha et al., in forms of psychosis: “the world comes to seem persistently unsafe. The sense that emotional experiences are out of one's personal control may prompt a search for meaning that may find explanations in terms of external influence.” [<a href=""#B102"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B102"">102</a>, p. 274].</p>"
"<p>On this point, it might be interesting to recall the observation of Owens that “anxiety phenomena may partially remit as psychotic features escalate” [<a href=""#B9"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B9"">9</a>, p. 390], that is, perhaps, when the classic symptoms of schizophrenia appear, including delusional ideas. This could suggest the possibility that delusional ideas might reduce anxiety because, as Conrad proposes, they allow a reorganization of reality with a new meaning, which does not correspond to the truth and is able to create serious problems in relationships with persons and things—for example, believing that the environment is artificially built in order to test the patient or to deceive him and so on [<a href=""#B2"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B2"">2</a>, p. 101]—but which is nevertheless not as frightening as the incomprehensible chaos that preceded. This might explain the relief with which schizophrenic patients seem to welcome the delusional reorganization of the environment, a relief which is very effectively expressed by Uhlhaas and Mishara in their discussion of the anomalies of perceptual processing in schizophrenia: “In beginning schizophrenia, the patient may have an agitated mood with the feeling that something very special or terrible is about to happen but is unable to say what this might be... Suddenly, from out of the fragments, the patient has an<em> aha erlebnis, </em>a sudden insight into the situation. This relieves the increasing distress due to the fragmentariness or gaps in the natural successive organization of this experience in time. The seeming “insight” of the delusion imposes a retroactive organization on the collected, non-temporalized fragments.” [<a href=""#B103"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B103"">103</a>, pp 147-148]. Fragments may refer to the inability to connect the various objects composing a scene, but also to individual objects, since in certain cases “not only the organization or the context between objects is loosened but also the objects themselves appear disintegrated” [<a href=""#B103"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B103"">103</a>, p 144].</p>"
"<p>This interpretation of the anxiety and of the delusional ideas present in schizophrenia could perhaps also help to propose a hypothesis to explain a fact that is still unexplained: blindness at birth seems to eliminate the risk of schizophrenia [<a href=""#B104"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B104"">104</a>, <a href=""#B105"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B105"">105</a>]. According to Silverstein et al., for example, in the United States there should be about 620 cases of people blind from birth who present schizophrenia, whereas in more than 60 years not a single case has been reported [<a href=""#B104"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B104"">104</a>]. One reason could be that those who are blind since birth cannot have had any deformed vision of their environment, and so they do not suffer any of the possible consequences, for example, the need for delusional ideas to interpret any deformations.</p>"
"<p>Taking into consideration the possibility that anhedonia could interfere with the correct reconstruction and interpretation of a world that continuously changes its appearance could perhaps help to explain the presence of alterations of the visual appearance of the environment found in the initial phase of schizophrenia. These alterations might be the cause of the anxious state that accompanies them, might sometimes provoke the sensation of being trapped by a predator, and according to some authors might induce delusional ideas.</p>"

"<p><strong>Background:</strong> Schizophrenia is a complex disorder characterized by positive symptoms (e.g., hallucinations), negative symptoms (e.g., social withdrawal), and disorganized symptoms (e.g., thought disorder). Alongside these, cognitive and depressive symptoms often emerge, with depressive symptoms sometimes dominating the clinical picture. Understanding the factors that influence the development of depressive symptoms in schizophrenia could clarify the dynamics between depressive and psychotic symptoms and guide clinical interventions. <strong>Methods:</strong> A total of 105 patients with schizophrenia (66 women, 39 men) were assessed using several clinical scales: PANSS, BPRS, DOCS, DES, HAM-D, and the Luria-Nebraska Neuropsychological Battery for cognitive evaluation. Statistical analyses, including correlation and regression, were conducted using SPSS to determine the significance of associations. <strong>Results:</strong> Disorganized and obsessive-compulsive symptoms were identified as primary factors associated with depressive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. Conversely, a longer duration of untreated psychosis was linked to a lower severity of depressive symptoms, suggesting that early intervention may alter the depressive symptom trajectory. <strong>Conclusions:</strong> Here, we suggest a complex interaction between psychotic and depressive symptoms, possibly indicating a biological antagonism. The association of depressive symptoms with disorganized and obsessive-compulsive features may reflect an adaptive psychological response, attempting to stabilize amidst the disintegration of schizophrenia. These insights support a more integrated approach to treatment, addressing both psychotic and depressive symptoms to improve patient outcomes.</p>"

"<p>Schizophrenia is a complex nosological entity that results from the interaction of genetic and epigenetic factors [<a href=""#B1-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B1-biomedicines-12-02646"">1</a>,<a href=""#B2-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B2-biomedicines-12-02646"">2</a>,<a href=""#B3-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B3-biomedicines-12-02646"">3</a>,<a href=""#B4-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B4-biomedicines-12-02646"">4</a>]. Genetic predisposition is easily detectable in the analysis of family history. This encumbrance in an etiological aspect cannot be accepted too categorically due to the influence of the impact of learned patterns of behavior, as well as the lack of stable parental role models. These factors can also be considered epigenetic impacts [<a href=""#B5-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B5-biomedicines-12-02646"">5</a>]. Analysis of the interaction of epigenetic influence and genetic polymorphism shows a relationship with both the development of the schizophrenia process and the effect of antipsychotic therapy [<a href=""#B6-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B6-biomedicines-12-02646"">6</a>]. The clinical picture of schizophrenic disorders is diverse, but positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms have been analyzed as the main storyline. In patients with schizophrenia, many other symptoms are also superimposed, such as anxiety, affective, and obsessive-compulsive disorders, as well as disorders in the perception of time and the perception of personal space [<a href=""#B7-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B7-biomedicines-12-02646"">7</a>,<a href=""#B8-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B8-biomedicines-12-02646"">8</a>]. All these deviations in mental status are also associated with changes in both metabolism and immunological markers [<a href=""#B9-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B9-biomedicines-12-02646"">9</a>,<a href=""#B10-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B10-biomedicines-12-02646"">10</a>]. All this multiplicity, both in the etiological and clinical aspects, poses the question of searching for a complex approach and therapeutic behavior that is consistent with the main and priority aspects in the clinical presentation [<a href=""#B11-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B11-biomedicines-12-02646"">11</a>,<a href=""#B12-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B12-biomedicines-12-02646"">12</a>,<a href=""#B13-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B13-biomedicines-12-02646"">13</a>].</p>"
"<p>Depressive symptoms and psychotic symptoms have many similarities and differences. These similarities and differences can be observed at the structural, functional, neurotransmitter, and metabolic levels. In both conditions, the analysis of structural disorders shows that we have a loss of gray brain matter in different parts of the brain, with a corresponding predilection for changes in them. In depression, changes are more pronounced in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex [<a href=""#B14-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B14-biomedicines-12-02646"">14</a>], and the amygdala and white brain matter [<a href=""#B15-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B15-biomedicines-12-02646"">15</a>]. In schizophrenia, they are associated with gray matter loss and cortical thickness reduction [<a href=""#B16-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B16-biomedicines-12-02646"">16</a>], as well as hippocampal and temporal lobe changes [<a href=""#B17-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B17-biomedicines-12-02646"">17</a>]. Functional changes in depression are associated with hyperactivity in the default mode network (DMN) [<a href=""#B18-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B18-biomedicines-12-02646"">18</a>] and hypoactivity in the executive control network (ECN), as well as hyperactivation of the amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) [<a href=""#B19-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B19-biomedicines-12-02646"">19</a>]. In psychosis, DMN hypoactivity and dysfunction [<a href=""#B20-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B20-biomedicines-12-02646"">20</a>] and dysregulation in the salience network (SN) [<a href=""#B21-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B21-biomedicines-12-02646"">21</a>] altered thalamocortical connectivity and dopamine system dysfunction [<a href=""#B22-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B22-biomedicines-12-02646"">22</a>]. Differences in the neurotransmitter system are also observed in both conditions. In depression, there are major changes in serotonin and norepinephrine [<a href=""#B23-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B23-biomedicines-12-02646"">23</a>], as well as in the glutamate and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis [<a href=""#B24-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B24-biomedicines-12-02646"">24</a>]. In schizophrenia, the main neurotransmitter changes are found in dopamine and glutamate [<a href=""#B25-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B25-biomedicines-12-02646"">25</a>,<a href=""#B26-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B26-biomedicines-12-02646"">26</a>], as well as in the dysfunction of NMDA receptor activity [<a href=""#B27-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B27-biomedicines-12-02646"">27</a>]. Differences can be found in a purely metabolic aspect, related to the metabolism of kynurenic acid. Schizophrenia shows a KYNA elevation that interferes with receptor activity crucial to cognitive function and psychosis [<a href=""#B28-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B28-biomedicines-12-02646"">28</a>] while depression often shows a neurotoxic shift, increasing quinolinic acid [<a href=""#B29-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B29-biomedicines-12-02646"">29</a>]. These changes also warrant the search for therapeutic strategies to influence kynurenic acid metabolism [<a href=""#B30-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B30-biomedicines-12-02646"">30</a>,<a href=""#B31-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B31-biomedicines-12-02646"">31</a>,<a href=""#B32-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B32-biomedicines-12-02646"">32</a>].</p>"
"<p>Depressive symptoms are frequent and characteristic symptoms observed in patients with schizophrenia. On the one hand, they can be observed as clinically established symptoms in the post-psychotic period, reaching up to 50% in patients with first episodes and up to 25% in those with subsequent episodes. The presence of these episodes is associated, according to some authors, with a poor prognosis [<a href=""#B33-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B33-biomedicines-12-02646"">33</a>,<a href=""#B34-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B34-biomedicines-12-02646"">34</a>]. The opinion of other authors takes an opposite position, associating affective symptoms with a favorable course of schizophrenia [<a href=""#B35-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B35-biomedicines-12-02646"">35</a>,<a href=""#B36-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B36-biomedicines-12-02646"">36</a>,<a href=""#B37-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B37-biomedicines-12-02646"">37</a>], especially in those with high values on the depression scale [<a href=""#B38-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B38-biomedicines-12-02646"">38</a>] and in those with high values on the mania scale [<a href=""#B39-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B39-biomedicines-12-02646"">39</a>]. The importance of depressive symptoms in the development of the schizophrenic process has led to their special classification in ICD 10 and ICD 11 as post-schizophrenic depression [<a href=""#B40-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B40-biomedicines-12-02646"">40</a>,<a href=""#B41-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B41-biomedicines-12-02646"">41</a>]. These divergent data indicate that depressive symptoms themselves are most likely to have a diverse genesis, which in turn is associated with a different prognosis. On the other hand, apart from being a clinically evident phenomenon, depressive symptomatology can be observed as a subclinical persistent finding in the clinical picture of patients, not always demonstrably presented and mixed with the main symptomatology. A study conducted with the aim of analyzing depressive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia showed that they are moderately pronounced and persistent over time in patients with resistance to treatment and are relatively mild in those in remission [<a href=""#B42-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B42-biomedicines-12-02646"">42</a>]. These data give us reason to conclude that smoldering depressive symptoms are associated with resistance to the schizophrenic process, while the appearance of pronounced depressive and manic symptoms is associated with a good prognosis.</p>"
"<p>In the analysis of the factors related to the presence of depressive symptoms, the author team established a relationship between the negative subscale of the PANSS and the scale of general psychopathology with sociodemographic factors such as loneliness, isolation, and lack of support [<a href=""#B43-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B43-biomedicines-12-02646"">43</a>,<a href=""#B44-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B44-biomedicines-12-02646"">44</a>]. On the other hand, whether there is a connection with sociodemographic factors as a cause of depressive symptoms or whether sociodemographic factors are a consequence of the development of the schizophrenic process with the gradient loss of social connectivity associated with its progression is a question that can be discussed. In this case, it is difficult to give an exact answer, as an analogy can be made with the question: ""Which came first - the chicken or the egg?""”</p>"
<p>There are multivariate analyses that present a different clinical value of depressive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. This lack of consistency in research gave us reasons to look for and establish the relationship between depressive symptoms and other factors and symptoms in patients with schizophrenia.</p>
"<p>In the analysis of the factors related to depressive symptoms, we considered it appropriate not to include the sociodemographic data. Due to the fact that they also appear as a result of the persistence of the main symptoms of the schizophrenia process, depressive complaints, in themselves and as the development of social maladaptation, appear to be directly deducible from the schizophrenic process.</p>"
"<p>We conducted a study of 105 patients with schizophrenia, of whom 66 were women and 39 were men. The examination and evaluation of the patients was carried out in the Psychiatric Clinic of the University General Hospital for Active Treatment —Stara Zagora. Patients were admitted for observation and treatment after consecutive psychotic episodes. The initial examination of the patients was performed in an outpatient setting, and after giving informed consent, they were admitted for treatment and assessment of the condition. Patients were recruited and followed for the period from 2017 to 2022.</p>"

"<p>For the purpose of the research, the capabilities of the statistical package SPSS version 26 were used. The methods used were tailored to the specifics and objectives of the research.

Independent variables were age, disease onset, duration of untreated symptoms, duration of schizophrenia process, body mass index, PANSS positive, negative, and disorganized symptoms, dissociation scale, and obsessive-compulsive symptom scale. An assessment of the co-linearity index was also made to measure the significance and reliability of the obtained results. We have also used analysis of variance (ANOVA) as a statistical formula used to compare variances across the means (or average) of different variables. A correlation analysis was also conducted to find a relationship between the analyzed variables. On the other hand, correlation analysis and its results are a prerequisite for the choice of method when conducting regression analysis.</p>"
"<p>The same group of patients was studied in order to investigate other clinical indicators such as obsessive-compulsive, dissociative, and cognitive symptoms, lateralization of brain processes, the effect of the administration of the first antipsychotic drug, and the role of gender in patients with schizophrenia [<a href=""#B42-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B42-biomedicines-12-02646"">42</a>,<a href=""#B54-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B54-biomedicines-12-02646"">54</a>,<a href=""#B55-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B55-biomedicines-12-02646"">55</a>,<a href=""#B56-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B56-biomedicines-12-02646"">56</a>,<a href=""#B57-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B57-biomedicines-12-02646"">57</a>,<a href=""#B58-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B58-biomedicines-12-02646"">58</a>,<a href=""#B59-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B59-biomedicines-12-02646"">59</a>,<a href=""#B60-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B60-biomedicines-12-02646"">60</a>].

"<p>The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital “Prof. Dr. Stoyan Kirkovich” Stara Zagora, protocol code TR3-02-242/30 December 2021.</p>"
"<p>Out of a total of 105 patients with schizophrenia, 66 were female and 39 were male. The mean age of patients was 37.13 years (<a href=""#biomedicines-12-02646-t001"" class=""usa-link"">Table 1</a>). The minimum age was 21 years and the maximum was 62 years.</p>"
<p>Some of the main characteristics of the group of patients.</p>

"<p>This analysis reveals that depressive symptoms are modestly associated with longer illness duration, suggesting that the chronicity of schizophrenia may contribute to increased depressive symptoms over time. However, onset age and duration of untreated symptoms do not appear to have direct impacts on depression levels. These findings point to a potentially cumulative effect of long-term schizophrenia on depressive experiences, which could suggest treatment approaches that address the emotional impact of prolonged illness.</p>"
"<p>The analysis of data in <a href=""#biomedicines-12-02646-t003"" class=""usa-link"">Table 3</a> reveals that depressive symptoms are moderately associated with overall psychiatric severity (PANSS and BPRS), particularly with disorganized symptoms. The findings suggest that disorganization, along with positive symptoms, may play a more significant role in the experience of depressive symptoms in schizophrenia than negative symptoms do. These insights highlight the importance of addressing both mood and cognitive disorganization in managing depressive symptoms within this population.</p>"
"<p>The analysis reveals that depressive symptoms are strongly associated with anxiety and obsessive-compulsive symptoms. In contrast, there is little to no significant relationship between depressive symptoms and dissociation or fixation. The strong link between anxiety and depression highlights the importance of addressing both conditions in clinical settings, as they often exacerbate each other. The associations found between dissociation and obsessive-compulsive symptoms suggest that these constructs may warrant further exploration, particularly in their relationship with depressive experiences. Also striking is the negative correlation between depressive symptoms and short-term memory reflected by fixation in this analysis. Overall, we can say that these findings emphasize the interconnected nature of various psychiatric symptoms and the need for comprehensive assessment and treatment strategies.</p>"
"<p>In order to establish the most important factors influencing the appearance of depressive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia, we conducted a regression analysis. Regression analysis was conducted, with the dependent variables being depressive symptoms. Independent variables were age, age of onset, duration of untreated symptoms, duration of schizophrenia process, body mass index (BMI), PANSS positive, negative, and disorganized symptoms, dissociation scale, and obsessive-compulsive symptom scale. The results are presented in <a href=""#biomedicines-12-02646-t005"" class=""usa-link"">Table 5</a> and <a href=""#biomedicines-12-02646-t006"" class=""usa-link"">Table 6</a>.</p>"
<p>Results of the regression analysis. The factors with a statistically significant influence on the occurrence of depressive symptoms and their coefficients are presented.</p>
<p>Statistical significance of established models when conducting regression analysis.</p>
<p>Regression analysis identified three main predictors and models.</p>
<p>These predictors are:</p>
"<p>PANSS Disorganized Symptoms: The strong positive impact of disorganized symptoms on depression highlights the significant role of cognitive and perceptual disorganization in contributing to depressive symptoms. This may reflect the distress and impairment that disorganized thinking and behavior impose, potentially fostering feelings of depressive complaints.</p>"
"<p>Duration of Untreated Symptoms: The negative relationship here suggests that individuals who experienced shorter periods of untreated psychosis report higher depressive symptoms. This finding could imply that early intervention mitigates long-term depressive symptoms, or that those who seek help sooner may be more likely to experience depression due to increased insight of their symptoms.</p>"
"<p>Obsessive-Compulsive Symptoms (OCS): The positive correlation between OCS scores and depressive symptoms implies that the presence of obsessive-compulsive symptoms may aggravate depressive symptoms, possibly due to the distress and mental strain associated with them.</p>"
"<p>Our study showed that gender distribution is not a factor related to the appearance of depressive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. In the main population, there is evidence that there is a clear distinction between the sexes, with depressive symptoms being more characteristic of females. This is also directly deducible from the differences between the sexes, related to biological, psychological, and social factors, which are a prerequisite for the prevalence of depressive symptoms in persons of the female gender [<a href=""#B61-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B61-biomedicines-12-02646"">61</a>]. This is not the case in patients with schizophrenia. One study examines gender differences in the onset and progression of schizophrenia, including the expression of depressive symptoms, and suggests that typical gender differences in depression may not apply to individuals with schizophrenia [<a href=""#B62-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B62-biomedicines-12-02646"">62</a>]. Our results support this study by showing that schizophrenia patients did not differ in terms of the expression of depressive complaints. Other articles have also discussed how schizophrenia may diminish the usual gender differences seen in mood disorders, with a focus on the expression of depressive symptoms [<a href=""#B63-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B63-biomedicines-12-02646"">63</a>,<a href=""#B64-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B64-biomedicines-12-02646"">64</a>,<a href=""#B65-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B65-biomedicines-12-02646"">65</a>]. Other studies have attempted to analyze the reasons for the lack of differences in the occurrence of depressive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. They examine and develop the concept of blunted gender differences in schizophrenia [<a href=""#B66-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B66-biomedicines-12-02646"">66</a>].</p>"
"<p>Another transcultural study also shows that there is a reduction of gender differences as a consequence of the influence of the schizophrenic process [<a href=""#B67-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B67-biomedicines-12-02646"">67</a>]. We also registered these blurred boundaries of gender differences in schizophrenia when conducting an assessment of the distribution of gender roles in patients with schizophrenia [<a href=""#B57-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B57-biomedicines-12-02646"">57</a>]. Our data also support the idea of blunted gender differences. The results of these studies give some authors reason to consider the idea of a strictly individual view and approach to these patients, not one based only on gender differences [<a href=""#B68-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B68-biomedicines-12-02646"">68</a>,<a href=""#B69-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B69-biomedicines-12-02646"">69</a>].</p>"
"<p>We find a directly proportional relationship between the expression of disorganized symptoms in schizophrenia and depressive symptoms. This dependence can be considered in the context that disorganized symptoms, unlike positive and negative symptoms, are directly related to functional impairment, which in turn leads to depressive complaints [<a href=""#B70-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B70-biomedicines-12-02646"">70</a>]. Negative symptoms are not perceived as ego-dystonic in the sense of suffering, and thus they do not lead to depressive complaints, although an overlap between depressive and negative symptoms may be observed outwardly, further impairing social functioning [<a href=""#B71-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B71-biomedicines-12-02646"">71</a>]. This close relationship between disorganized and depressive symptoms, as was shown in our previous study between disorganized and obsessive-compulsive symptoms [<a href=""#B54-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B54-biomedicines-12-02646"">54</a>], gives us reason to consider the idea of symptom formation as a consequence of the development of a process of “disintegration” in patients with schizophrenia. We can view depressive, positive, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms as defense mechanisms against the “disintegration” underlying the schizophrenic process [<a href=""#B72-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B72-biomedicines-12-02646"">72</a>,<a href=""#B73-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B73-biomedicines-12-02646"">73</a>,<a href=""#B74-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B74-biomedicines-12-02646"">74</a>].</p>"
"<p>This study also gives us an explanation of why we find obsessive-compulsive symptoms as a factor that is, to a large extent, a determinant of the appearance of depressive symptoms. Obsessive-compulsive symptoms themselves lead to severe stress and can further trigger the onset of depressive symptoms. Obsessive-compulsive symptoms in schizophrenia can also be seen as an adaptive phenomenon, a reaction against the chaos of disorganized symptoms [<a href=""#B75-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B75-biomedicines-12-02646"">75</a>].</p>"
"<p>We find the greatest association of depressive symptoms with disorganized and obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Another study of ours, which analyzed obsessive-compulsive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia, showed that they were also highly associated with the presence of disorganized symptoms [<a href=""#B54-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B54-biomedicines-12-02646"">54</a>]. Is it precisely the disorganized symptoms, symptoms without organization, that do not seek their secondary organization as psychotic, obsessive-compulsive, and depressive symptoms? Other studies also find a link between disorganized and depressive symptoms [<a href=""#B76-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B76-biomedicines-12-02646"">76</a>,<a href=""#B77-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B77-biomedicines-12-02646"">77</a>,<a href=""#B78-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B78-biomedicines-12-02646"">78</a>,<a href=""#B79-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B79-biomedicines-12-02646"">79</a>,<a href=""#B80-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B80-biomedicines-12-02646"">80</a>,<a href=""#B81-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B81-biomedicines-12-02646"">81</a>]. When conducting a correlation analysis, we found a high correlation dependence of depressive complaints, both with the individual subscales of the PANSS and with the BPRS scale. We found a higher correlation significance of depressive symptoms with disorganized symptoms and with the BPRS scale. The explanation of this observation can be found in the research that conducted a comparison between the PANSS and BPRS scales. The PANSS scale is much more specific than the BPRS. The BPRS scale reflects more the main psychopathology, which is also related to an overlap with some depressive and disorganized symptoms, which is the reason for their higher correlation coefficient [<a href=""#B82-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B82-biomedicines-12-02646"">82</a>,<a href=""#B83-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B83-biomedicines-12-02646"">83</a>,<a href=""#B84-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B84-biomedicines-12-02646"">84</a>].</p>"
"<p>Our study found that the duration of untreated symptoms was inversely related to the development of depressive symptoms. We find that the longer the duration of untreated psychosis, the lower the likelihood of developing depressive complaints. How should we analyze this observation?</p>"
"<p>In the context that psychosis is the primary and main disease, depressive symptomatology appears as an additional symptom in the course of the evolution of the disease or, on the other hand, as a side effect and as a symptom as a result of therapy. These relationships can be considered in the context of the relationship between dopamine blockade and depression, cognitive impairment associated with dopamine blockade, fatigue, sedation, motor side effects, etc. [<a href=""#B78-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B78-biomedicines-12-02646"">78</a>,<a href=""#B85-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B85-biomedicines-12-02646"">85</a>,<a href=""#B86-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B86-biomedicines-12-02646"">86</a>] . This is also the classic approach to looking at these relationships, and for this reason, in the F20 rubric of ICD 10 and 11, we have a sub-section on post-schizophrenic depression. Our data on the inverse correlation between depressive symptoms and duration of untreated psychosis prompts us to discuss another hypothesis. Since depressive symptomatology appears, on the one hand, as one of the main prodromal symptoms in schizophrenia, on the other hand, it represents a symptom that we can follow in the course of the schizophrenic process. From this point of view, the interrelationships between depressive and psychotic symptoms give us reason to ask the questionCan we not take a mirror look at these processes?</p>"
"<p>Depression is the primary disorder in which, in some cases, psychotic symptomatology is superimposed, which is clinically significant, expressed, and meets the diagnostic criteria of the main classification systems and, as such, requires antipsychotic therapy. In support of this observation comes the fact that often-expressed depression has psychotic symptoms that require antipsychotic therapy in parallel with the use of antidepressants [<a href=""#B87-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B87-biomedicines-12-02646"">87</a>,<a href=""#B88-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B88-biomedicines-12-02646"">88</a>,<a href=""#B89-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B89-biomedicines-12-02646"">89</a>,<a href=""#B90-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B90-biomedicines-12-02646"">90</a>,<a href=""#B91-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B91-biomedicines-12-02646"">91</a>].</p>"
"<p>On the other hand, the use of antidepressants has an effect on patients with schizophrenic disorder, even in the absence of clinically expressed depressive symptoms [<a href=""#B92-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B92-biomedicines-12-02646"">92</a>,<a href=""#B93-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B93-biomedicines-12-02646"">93</a>,<a href=""#B94-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B94-biomedicines-12-02646"">94</a>,<a href=""#B95-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B95-biomedicines-12-02646"">95</a>].</p>"
"<p>We can also judge the proximity of the two states by their prognosis. Both schizophrenia and psychotic depression have a similar prognosis, despite the presence of certain differences [<a href=""#B96-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B96-biomedicines-12-02646"">96</a>,<a href=""#B97-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B97-biomedicines-12-02646"">97</a>,<a href=""#B98-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B98-biomedicines-12-02646"">98</a>,<a href=""#B99-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B99-biomedicines-12-02646"">99</a>], which, again, gives us reason to question what is the primary underlying disorder. On the other hand, perhaps we should just accept that the question is largely rhetorical and that the two states are interwoven as one common entity.</p>"
"<p>These clinical observations give us reason to look at the biochemical disturbances in order to find similarities between them. In both conditions, a biochemical imbalance is established. In both conditions, there is a dopamine imbalance, disorders of serotonin, glutamate transmission, GABA mediation, an increased level of inflammatory factors, and a generally increased inflammatory background, associated with a change in cortisol secretion [<a href=""#B100-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B100-biomedicines-12-02646"">100</a>,<a href=""#B101-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B101-biomedicines-12-02646"">101</a>,<a href=""#B102-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B102-biomedicines-12-02646"">102</a>,<a href=""#B103-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B103-biomedicines-12-02646"">103</a>].</p>"
"<p>If we look at DMN changes in depression and psychosis, we find that they are opposite. While, in depression, we have hyperactivity [<a href=""#B18-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B18-biomedicines-12-02646"">18</a>], in schizophrenia, we have altered activity related to the loss of connectivity or altered activity to hypoactivity [<a href=""#B20-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B20-biomedicines-12-02646"">20</a>]. This process is most likely also related to the disorganization in the sense of “I”, which provokes the creation of clinical symptoms such as positive or depressive or OCD [<a href=""#B104-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B104-biomedicines-12-02646"">104</a>]. How can we explain, from this perspective based on DMN dysfunction, the inverse relationship between the duration of untreated psychosis and depressive symptoms? The prolonged state of dysfunction of this neuronal network over time is related to strengthening the loss of connectivity at the functional and neuronal level, where it becomes even more difficult to react with “hyperfunction” of the same system and transition to depression.</p>"
"<p>In patients with resistant schizophrenia, depressive symptoms are registered in the range of moderately expressed [<a href=""#B42-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B42-biomedicines-12-02646"">42</a>]. These results can be commented on in light of our observation that schizophrenic disorder, which is essentially a form of disorganization of the psyche, finds its clinical expression in the construction of disorganized symptoms as a clinical phenomenon. The organism is not able to reach a new form of mental allostasis, regardless of whether it is a psychotic or depressive episode, and remains in an unbalanced state with persistent disorganized symptoms, which also show the highest degree of resistance in individual studies [<a href=""#B105-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B105-biomedicines-12-02646"">105</a>,<a href=""#B106-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B106-biomedicines-12-02646"">106</a>,<a href=""#B107-biomedicines-12-02646"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B107-biomedicines-12-02646"">107</a>].</p>"
"<p>Limitation: The limitation of our study is related, on the one hand, to the number of observed patients. In order to answer fundamental questions related to the perception and analysis of the clinical dynamics of larger nosological categories, observation of a large number of patients with a long follow-up period is necessary, which we are currently unable to provide. The observation of these patients continues, which gives us the opportunity to follow the pathoplasticity of the described phenomenology, which we hope to be able to present in the future.</p>"
"<p>Another limitation of our study is that it is purely clinical, as we did not have the opportunity to analyze the functional connections in individual neuronal networks, metabolic disorders, and individual registered inflammatory markers characterizing these processes.</p>"
"<p>We found that the presence of disorganized and obsessive-compulsive symptoms is associated with the appearance of depressive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. Additionally, an inverse relationship between the duration of untreated psychosis and the onset of depressive symptoms suggests that early intervention may impact the development of depressive features. These findings offer valuable insights for clinical practice, potentially enabling the prediction of individual symptom dynamics throughout the course of the schizophrenic process. Moreover, these observations prompt a reconsideration of the relationship between depression and psychosis as conditions that often exhibit convergent aspects in therapy. Rather than viewing them as separate entities, our results align with the concept of a single underlying pathology—a unified disease process that may express itself through varying symptom profiles over time. This perspective encourages a holistic approach to treatment, addressing core vulnerabilities that underpin both psychotic and depressive symptoms in a continuum of mental health disorders.</p>"

<p>Major depressive disorder contributes to the global burden of mental illness. Therapeutic guidelines promote treatment self-management and support caregivers and family members in this process.</p>
<p>We aimed to identify therapeutic guidelines for the symptoms of major depressive disorder.</p>
"<p>This scoping review followed the assumptions established by the Joanna Briggs Institute and the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) protocol, carried out in 12 databases (LILACS, PubMed, SciELO, Scopus, Web of Science, b-on, BDENF, AgeLine, Cochrane, BVS, IBECS, and CINAHL) and 5 secondary gray literature sources (Google Scholar, Global ETD Search, EBSCO Open Dissertations, CAPES Catalog of Theses and Dissertations, and the Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations of the University of Sao Paulo). The eligibility criteria were based on the population, concept, and context framework: people diagnosed with major depressive disorder aged &gt;18 years (population), therapeutic guidelines for self-management of major depressive disorder symptoms (concept), and symptoms of major depressive disorder (context). Data collection was carried out from March to July 2022 and updated in June 2024. The included studies were experimental, quasi-experimental, analytical observational, descriptive observational, qualitative, or quantitative studies; systematic reviews and meta-analyses; and scoping and literature reviews published in full without time restrictions in English, Spanish, or Portuguese. All the information, as well as the studies captured, was stored in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet using Rayyan and the <em>JBI Manual for Evidence Synthesis</em>. The titles, abstracts, and full texts were carefully read and classified, extracting the results. After review by 2 independent researchers, 62 studies were selected. The results are presented descriptively, including characterization of the studies and mapping and categorization of groups and subgroups of therapeutic guidelines for self-management of major depressive disorder.</p>"
"<p>In total, 62 studies published between 2011 and 2023 were included, where 44 (71%) came from indexed data sources and 18 (29%) were gray literature indexed on Google Scholar (13/62, 21%), doctoral theses (3/62, 5%), and master’s dissertations (2/62, 3%). Among the therapeutic guidelines identified, mapped, and categorized, 7 major groups were identified for self-management: psychotherapy (32/62, 52%), adoption of healthy habits (25/62, 40%), integrative and complementary practices (17/62, 27%), relaxation techniques (9/62, 14%), consultation with a health professional (14/62, 22%), pharmacological therapy (9/62, 14%), and leisure or pleasurable activities (4/62, 6%).</p>"
"<p>It was possible to identify therapeutic guidelines to promote self-management of major depressive disorder in the adult population. Therapeutic guidance is an important resource for patients, their families, and the community, making patients the protagonists of their own health. For health professionals, therapeutic guidelines become tools that help develop skills and competencies for care among patients, thus ensuring their ability to self-manage major depressive disorder.</p>"

"<p>Major depressive disorder is one of the most prevalent mental disorders in the world, as well as one of the clinical conditions that contributes most to the global burden of mental illnesses [<a href=""#ref1"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref1"">1</a>]. The number of people presenting with symptoms suggestive of this disorder has shown a significant increase at an alarming and worrying rate, and it is estimated that it will be the world’s first major disabling public health problem by 2030 [<a href=""#ref2"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref2"">2</a>].</p>"
"<p>It is a classic mental disorder that involves evident alterations in affect, cognition, and neurovegetative functions, affecting approximately 300 million people worldwide [<a href=""#ref2"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref2"">2</a>]. It is estimated that 3.8% of cases lead to functional incapacity and damage to physical and mental health, as well as professional losses and considerable morbidity and mortality due to suicide or association with other illnesses [<a href=""#ref3"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref3"">3</a>].</p>"
"<p>In addition to these impacts, it is difficult to diagnose major depressive disorder accurately and quickly as its classification and assessment are based on clinical findings and the patient’s history [<a href=""#ref2"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref2"">2</a>]. Therapies for the treatment of major depressive disorder, such as psychobiosocial therapies, psychotherapy, and pharmacotherapy, have advanced and are used according to the severity of the symptoms and potential adverse events [<a href=""#ref4"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref4"">4</a>]. Considering that mental health care has undergone important transformations, such as the creation of an out-of-hospital network made up of substitute services that propose the rescue of the singularity or subjectivity of the person in psychological distress, respecting their integrality and existence [<a href=""#ref5"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref5"">5</a>], promoting their autonomy in the management of the illness or treatment means encouraging empowerment, the ability to make choices, and taking responsibility for themselves as a citizen and social being [<a href=""#ref6"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref6"">6</a>].</p>"
"<p>This knowledge and skills are important tools to prevent complications, control symptoms, self-manage treatment, and even avoid recurrences and hospitalizations [<a href=""#ref7"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref7"">7</a>]. Due to the complexity of the disease, some adaptive actions can be taken, including controlling destabilizing factors, preserving self-confidence, re-establishing important relationships, attempting to regain functioning, managing symptoms, negotiating the care environment, and maintaining satisfying relationships [<a href=""#ref7"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref7"">7</a>,<a href=""#ref8"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref8"">8</a>].</p>"
"<p>Society has been moving toward the construction and adoption of technological innovations using smartphones and computer applications. These resources can be of great value in the process of promoting people’s skills in the mental health field [<a href=""#ref8"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref8"">8</a>]. In this sense, based on the results of this scoping review, a systematic set of therapeutic guidelines was developed based on clinical practice and scientific evidence. This set of therapeutic guidelines is capable of supporting a computational application, generating knowledge in the area of mental health, creating a connection with the patient, and supporting self-management of one’s health remotely [<a href=""#ref8"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref8"">8</a>,<a href=""#ref9"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref9"">9</a>].</p>"
"<p>These therapeutic guidelines can be adopted with the aim of promoting and supporting self-management in the daily treatment of the patient and supporting the caregiver or family members in performing techniques safely and appropriately, completing therapeutic sessions, maintaining functionality, or preventing possible complications of the disorder [<a href=""#ref9"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref9"">9</a>]. It should be emphasized that, although it is important to encourage self-management by the individual and the family, it is also essential that the care provided by health professionals, including nurses, assists in the promotion and reorganization of the self, breaks and overcomes relationships of dependence, and levels the acquisition or development of knowledge and skills for self-management [<a href=""#ref7"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref7"">7</a>,<a href=""#ref9"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref9"">9</a>].</p>"
"<p>Given the extent of the symptomatology and the particularities of major depressive disorder, a scoping review allows for an exhaustive analysis of the studies available so that the patient has access to information that will allow them to develop attitudes, knowledge, and skills to self-manage based on the best scientific evidence.</p>"
"<p>Similarly, a set of therapeutic guidelines will constitute an instrument for the clinical practice of nurses and of the multidisciplinary team as the deepening of specific skills will allow for the provision of individualized care that is more suited to the needs of the person with major depressive disorder. Therefore, this scoping review was carried out with the aim of identifying therapeutic guidelines in scientific production for the self-management of major depressive disorder symptoms.</p>"
"<p>A scoping review is used to map key concepts, examine existing evidence before conducting a systematic review, and clarify and define conceptual boundaries. This scoping review was prepared in accordance with the methodological proposal of the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) in 2020, supported by the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) [<a href=""#ref10"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref10"">10</a>] and PRISMA extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) [<a href=""#ref11"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref11"">11</a>] guidelines based on the following steps: formulation of the research question, identification of relevant studies, selection of studies, extraction and analysis of data, and synthesis and construction of the report. The PRISMA-ScR checklist is available in <a href=""#app1"" class=""usa-link"">Multimedia Appendix 1</a>. This review protocol was registered in the Open Science Framework platform [<a href=""#ref12"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref12"">12</a>] on November 11, 2023, and was modified on February 19, 2025. There was no deviation from the protocol registered on the Open Science Framework platform.</p>"
"<p>To formulate the guiding research question and guide data collection, the population, concept, and context (PCC) framework was used. The PCC strategy was adopted to drive the research question of this scoping review. In this study, <em>population</em> refers to people diagnosed with major depressive disorder aged &gt;18 years, <em>concept</em> refers to therapeutic guidelines for self-management of major depressive disorder symptoms, and <em>context</em> refers to major depressive disorder symptoms (eg, changes in weight, appetite, and sleep; feelings of guilt; irritability or bad mood; anhedonia; fatigue; and low self-esteem).</p>"
"<p>Therefore, the following guiding question was defined: “What therapeutic guidelines support self-management of changes in weight, appetite, sleep, feelings of guilt, irritability or bad mood, anhedonia, fatigue and low self-esteem?”</p>"
"<p>The data search was carried out in 12 information sources (LILACS, PubMed, SciELO, Scopus, Web of Science, b-on, BDENF, AgeLine, Cochrane, BVS, IBECS, and CINAHL) and 5 secondary information sources of gray literature (Google Scholar, Global ETD Search, EBSCO Open Dissertations, CAPES Catalog of Theses and Dissertations, and the Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations of the University of Sao Paulo).</p>"
"<p>The search strategy was developed using the controlled and noncontrolled descriptors obtained in the initial search plus the Boolean operators “OR,” “NOT,” and “AND,” as well as keywords found in the Health Sciences Descriptors and Medical Subject Headings of the US National Library of Medicine combined with each other according to each database.

"<p>The search followed five distinct phases according to the JBI methodology, and a team of 5 researchers was assembled for this scoping review: (1) initial search in the selected databases to identify articles on the topic and, from there, select words and indexing terms contained in these publications to develop the full search strategy; (2) use of the keywords and indexing terms identified to search all the databases included; (3) definition of the study design and eligibility criteria, including the determination of the type of study, target population, interventions and outcomes analyzed. In addition, inclusion and exclusion criteria were established for the selection of studies; (4) identification and selection of studies, including the systematic search in databases and sources of gray literature, application of filters and search strategies to ensure the identification of relevant studies and screening of relevant articles (reading of titles, abstracts and, when necessary, the full text); and (5) data extraction and analysis, including the collection of information from the selected studies, the assessment of methodological quality and the synthesis of findings.</p>"
"<p>The eligibility criteria are described in <a href=""#box1"" class=""usa-link"">Textbox 1</a>, and the studies found were refined based on the PCC acronym, type of study, year of publication, language, and results.

<strong>Inclusion criteria</strong>
</p>"
<p>Population: people diagnosed with major depressive disorder aged &gt;18 years</p>
<p>Concept: therapeutic guidelines for the self-management of symptoms of major depressive disorder</p>
"<p>Context: symptoms of major depressive disorder, such as changes in weight, appetite, and sleep; feelings of guilt; irritability or bad mood; anhedonia; fatigue; and low self-esteem</p>"
"<p>Type of study: experimental and quasi-experimental studies (randomized and nonrandomized controlled trials), analytical observational studies (prospective and retrospective cohort studies, case-control studies, and analytical cross-sectional studies), descriptive observational studies (case series, individual case reports, and descriptive cross-sectional studies), qualitative and quantitative studies, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, scoping reviews, and literature reviews; due to the scarcity of publications found in the databases, it was also decided to include gray literature (course completion studies, dissertations, and theses)</p>"
<p>Year: there were no restrictions on the search period as the first search strategies developed yielded few studies on the subject</p>
"<p>Language: English, Spanish, and Portuguese</p>"
<p>Results: publications whose objective addressed therapeutic guidelines to assist in the self-management of patients with active symptoms of major depressive disorder</p>
"<p>
<strong>Exclusion criteria</strong>
</p>"
"<p>Population, concept, and context: publications without information on the population, concept, and context of interest for this study</p>"
"<p>Type of study: duplicate studies, opinion articles, letters to the editor, abstracts of conference proceedings, and studies with unavailable text</p>"
<p>Language: studies in languages other than those selected</p>
"<p>Results: publications that did not fit the objectives and did not contain information related to the population, concept, and context of this study</p>"
"<p>The process of identifying and selecting studies is one of the most important stages in the conduct of a scoping review. To minimize potential bias, the <em>JBI Manual for Evidence Synthesis</em> guidelines were used and explained in a meeting with 6 researchers to ensure that this process was clear to everyone.</p>"
"<p>Thus, to maintain the rigor of the screening process, the studies obtained from each of the databases based on the eligibility criteria were exported to a reference management software (EndNote; Clarivate Analytics), and duplicates were removed. The remaining studies were then imported into the Rayyan application (Qatar Computing Research Institute) for analysis and selection based on titles and abstracts.</p>"
"<p>The titles and abstracts were read and analyzed by 2 independent reviewers to identify those that were potentially eligible. After reading the titles and abstracts, the preselected studies were subjected to data analysis and mapping, which consisted of carefully reading and classifying the texts from which the results were extracted.</p>"
<p>The selected studies were read in full by 2 additional reviewers (MdPSdSN and PdCT) to confirm their relevance to the research question. Any doubts about the inclusion of studies would be resolved through discussion with a third reviewer until a consensus was reached. It was not necessary to contact a third reviewer.</p>
"<p>As recommended by the JBI, the authors developed a tool to extract the data for the scoping review. Those responsible for data extraction (MdPSdSN, PdCT, and PMM) read and carefully classified the texts. The data were documented in a Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corp) spreadsheet for better data extraction and evaluation. The final studies were determined from this step. The following variables were extracted from the studies: symptoms, authors, year, reference, study title, objective, study design, and mapping of results.</p>"
"<p>The focuses of the studies were analyzed, and the results and discussion are presented descriptively and quantified as frequencies in tables. The Discussion section synthesizes the evidence found during the review to explore it and compare it with the existing literature.</p>"
"<p>The mapped results were categorized into 7 major groups and subgroups of therapeutic orientations for the self-management of major depressive disorder based on the similarities between them. For example, therapeutic orientations focused on physical activity or regular exercise and healthy eating were classified as adoption of healthy habits, whereas listening to music, watching movies, reading, painting, going out with friends, taking outdoor walks, and practicing spiritual and religious activities were grouped in the category of leisure or pleasurable activities. This was done for all the therapeutic orientations identified considering the objective of this scoping review.</p>"
"<p>Regarding the methodological assessment (although it was not mandatory), each included study had its level of evidence identified based on the JBI appraisal tools [<a href=""#ref13"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref13"">13</a>] and the study design.</p>"
"<p>Thus, classification I was assigned to systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials, classification II was assigned to randomized clinical trials, classification III was assigned to nonrandomized controlled trials, classification IV was assigned to case-control or cohort studies, classification V was assigned to systematic reviews of qualitative or descriptive studies, classification VI was assigned to qualitative or descriptive studies, and classification VII was assigned to opinions of authorities or expert committee reports. This hierarchy classifies levels I and II as strong, levels III to V as moderate, and levels VI to VII as weak.</p>"
"<p>Initially, 258,509 potentially eligible publications were found in the databases and 13,081 publications in the gray literature sources, of which 1538 (0.63%) focused on sleep disorders, 8315 (3.39%) focused on appetite disorders, 6732 (2.74%) focused on weight disorders, 5814 (2.37%) focused on feelings of guilt, 2509 (1.02%) focused on irritable mood, 200,002 (81.46%) focused on low self-esteem, 1848 (0.75%) focused on anhedonia, and 31,832 (7.64%) focused on fatigue.</p>"
"<p>The inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied, and 247,348 duplicate studies were removed, leaving 11,242 (4.55%). Next, a new screening was carried out in search of available publications that had abstracts and dealt with therapeutic guidelines.

"<p>Once the 1242 studies had been selected, the second full reading was carried out. Of the 1242 studies, 1180 (95.01%) were excluded because they did not answer the guiding question.

<p>General characterization of the included studies (N=62).</p>
"<p>It was found that the studies were published between 2011 and 2023, with a higher number of publications in the years 2018 to 2023 (40/62, 63%), demonstrating that the use of therapeutic guidelines is recently evolving. In terms of language, most publications were in English (North America—United States) and Portuguese (South America—Brazil), totaling 63% (40/62) of the publications (<a href=""#table1"" class=""usa-link"">Table 1</a>).</p>"
"<p>Regarding study design, the studies were clinical trials (30/62, 48%), systematic reviews (6/62, 10%), narrative literature reviews (7/62, 11%), systematic reviews and meta-analyses (6/62, 10%), qualitative studies (3/62, 5%), pilot studies (3/62, 5%), experimental studies (2/62, 3%), case reports (2/62, 3%), noncontrolled studies (1/62, 2%), cross-sectional studies (1/62, 2%), and scoping reviews (1/62, 2%; <a href=""#table1"" class=""usa-link"">Table 1</a>).</p>"

"<p>The evidence available from the included studies to promote self-management of the symptoms of major depressive disorder describes the characteristics, benefits, and applicability of therapeutic guidelines in everyday life, demonstrating that these guidelines can promote a safe space to share conversations on sensitive subjects such as stigma and prejudice, adverse drug events, diagnosis, and relapse [<a href=""#ref14"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref14"">14</a>-<a href=""#ref75"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref75"">75</a>].</p>"
"<p>The findings also point out that, to promote self-management through therapeutic guidelines, it is necessary to know the functionality of the patient or family, have access to community resources and a social support network, and monitor the participation of these individuals in their care [<a href=""#ref16"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref16"">16</a>,<a href=""#ref33"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref33"">33</a>,<a href=""#ref35"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref35"">35</a>,<a href=""#ref37"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref37"">37</a>,<a href=""#ref40"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref40"">40</a>]. The interdisciplinary team’s online or face-to-face follow-up of patients with major depressive disorder involves monitoring the use of therapeutic guidelines and whether they are being carried out correctly and appropriately considering the individual’s uniqueness, as well as monitoring changes in symptoms and problems with medication, providing social support, and identifying patients at high risk of relapse [<a href=""#ref23"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref23"">23</a>,<a href=""#ref41"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref41"">41</a>].</p>"
"<p>Another common point cited in the studies was the ability of health professionals to instruct patients with major depressive disorder on how to deal with symptoms and biosociopsychological demands [<a href=""#ref16"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref16"">16</a>,<a href=""#ref31"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref31"">31</a>-<a href=""#ref33"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref33"">33</a>]. Professionals require skills and good communication with patients when instructing them on the use of therapeutic guidelines for managing the disorder, since incorrect instructions or misunderstandings may make the application of therapeutic guidelines less efficient [<a href=""#ref23"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref23"">23</a>,<a href=""#ref35"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref35"">35</a>,<a href=""#ref37"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref37"">37</a>,<a href=""#ref40"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref40"">40</a>,<a href=""#ref67"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref67"">67</a>,<a href=""#ref70"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref70"">70</a>,<a href=""#ref74"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref74"">74</a>,<a href=""#ref75"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref75"">75</a>]. If the professional advises the patient to sunbathe (phototherapy) during the day, but does not specify the time, this may cause the patient to take this guidance at inappropriate times and be harmful to their health. Therefore, phototherapy would not be effective. The findings encourage a multidisciplinary approach to the applicability of therapeutic guidelines, focusing on the specificities of each person and collective actions, strengthening the patient’s ability to self-manage.</p>"
"<p>The analysis of the studies, as described previously, resulted in the mapping and categorization of 7 large groups of therapeutic guidelines for the self-management of major depressive disorder.

"<p>In total, 52% (32/62) of the therapeutic guidelines identified fell into the category of psychotherapy, which helps monitor and plan activities with the person (in the context of their symptoms), manage adverse experiences, and develop social skills [<a href=""#ref14"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref14"">14</a>,<a href=""#ref16"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref16"">16</a>,<a href=""#ref17"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref17"">17</a>,<a href=""#ref22"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref22"">22</a>,<a href=""#ref23"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref23"">23</a>,<a href=""#ref26"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref26"">26</a>,<a href=""#ref28"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref28"">28</a>,<a href=""#ref29"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref29"">29</a>,<a href=""#ref31"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref31"">31</a>,<a href=""#ref36"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref36"">36</a>-<a href=""#ref38"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref38"">38</a>,<a href=""#ref46"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref46"">46</a>,<a href=""#ref56"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref56"">56</a>,<a href=""#ref58"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref58"">58</a>-<a href=""#ref72"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref72"">72</a>,<a href=""#ref74"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref74"">74</a>,<a href=""#ref75"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref75"">75</a>]. Adoption of healthy habits (25/62, 40%) and integrative and complementary practices (17/62, 27%) were the second and third most observed categories.

"<p>Finally, relaxation techniques (9/62, 14%), consultation with a health professional (14/62, 22%), pharmacological therapy (9/62, 14%), and leisure or pleasurable activities (4/62, 6%) were the least observed therapeutic guidelines in the studies. However, they offered promising insights into self-management of the disorder and underscored the importance of a multifaceted approach to managing this complex condition [<a href=""#ref16"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref16"">16</a>,<a href=""#ref20"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref20"">20</a>,<a href=""#ref23"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref23"">23</a>, <a href=""#ref26"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref26"">26</a>-<a href=""#ref30"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref30"">30</a>,<a href=""#ref33"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref33"">33</a>,<a href=""#ref36"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref36"">36</a>-<a href=""#ref38"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref38"">38</a>,<a href=""#ref41"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref41"">41</a>,<a href=""#ref50"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref50"">50</a>,<a href=""#ref57"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref57"">57</a>,<a href=""#ref66"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref66"">66</a>].</p>"
"<p>It is widely recognized that the concept of self-management is traditionally associated with approaches that the patient can carry out autonomously, such as adopting healthy habits, physical exercise, and relaxation techniques. However, it is crucial to emphasize that, in the context of major depressive disorder, self-management transcends these independent symptom management practices [<a href=""#ref37"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref37"">37</a>].</p>"
"<p>It involves empowering the patient to take active control and gain an in-depth understanding of their condition through the application of a variety of therapeutic interventions [<a href=""#ref35"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref35"">35</a>]. Patients with major depressive disorder may experience feelings of frustration and a range of negative thoughts, see everyday problems as major catastrophes, have difficulty recognizing efforts that awaken hope for life, and cope with the possible adverse events that psychiatric medications can cause [<a href=""#ref66"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref66"">66</a>].</p>"
"<p>For this reason, orientation toward psychotherapy and psychopharmaceuticals is justified as a self-management strategy as a way of coping with the adverse effects of medication and all the feelings of self-demand, excessive demands, and frustration caused by the disorder.</p>"
"<p>In relation to the population to which this study refers, the results show that patients with major depressive disorder have motivational, cognitive, and psychological deficits that can modify their ability to cope and reason [<a href=""#ref22"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref22"">22</a>,<a href=""#ref60"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref60"">60</a>,<a href=""#ref63"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref63"">63</a>,<a href=""#ref65"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref65"">65</a>].</p>"
"<p>In view of this, self-management of the signs and symptoms resulting from major depressive disorder needs to take place at the beginning of treatment, with the support of family or caregivers; friends; community organizations; and, most especially, the multi-professional health team to help with the correct use of therapeutic options until the person is able to self-manage independently [<a href=""#ref14"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref14"">14</a>-<a href=""#ref75"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref75"">75</a>]. Therefore, the therapeutic guidelines found in this review are not restricted to the professional-patient relationship; these relationships are broad and include families and the community.</p>"
"<p>From this review, it was possible to identify the therapeutic guidelines for the self-management of the symptoms of major depressive disorder in scientific production as psychotherapy, adoption of healthy habits, integrative and complementary practices, relaxation techniques, consultation with a health professional, pharmacological therapy, and leisure or pleasurable activities.</p>"
"<p>The selected studies show that knowledge on the subject significantly improves self-management of the symptoms of major depressive disorder through these therapeutic guidelines to promote behavior changes and awareness of the symptoms of the disorder, prevention of relapses, reduction of the perception of obstacles, and increased adherence to treatment.</p>"
"<p>A small number of articles published in journals on the subject were found for all the symptoms investigated, especially irritable mood, followed by fatigue, weight change, appetite change, sleep changes, and low self-esteem, necessitating the addition of secondary documents that considerably broadened the identification of other therapeutic guidelines.</p>"
"<p>Most of the studies originated in America (40/62, 63%), where the largest number of people with major depressive disorder is concentrated. Regarding the concept that triggered the research, the studies involved health professionals, students, and the general population, covering the definition, description, comparative analysis, efficiency, and applicability of therapeutic guidelines. These studies were included to increase the possibility of nurses playing a leading role in the self-management of symptoms of major depressive disorder [<a href=""#ref14"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref14"">14</a>-<a href=""#ref75"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref75"">75</a>].</p>"
"<p>The factors considered important for the self-application of therapeutic guidelines in the studies were cognition; level of education; environmental factors; and the functional capacity of the patient, caregivers, and family members. It should be emphasized that, for self-management, clients who are going to follow these therapeutic guidelines should receive them in clear and objective language and format, with specificity and relevance for each symptom, enabling adherence to treatment and favoring the therapist–patient or caregiver bond [<a href=""#ref26"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref26"">26</a>]. These therapeutic guidelines are also considered low cost and easy to use, optimize rehabilitation and autonomy, and encourage self-care [<a href=""#ref26"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref26"">26</a>]. It is important to highlight the definitions of each of the therapeutic guidelines identified in this review.</p>"
"<p>Integrative and complementary practices, as therapeutic resources based on traditional knowledge, were the therapeutic guidelines most commonly found in the literature as effective for the self-management and management of major depressive disorder symptoms, and their applicability aimed to induce a state of harmony and balance throughout the body.</p>"
"<p>Phototherapy has been shown to reduce depressive symptoms and improve irregularities in sleep patterns and quality, especially in older adults with major depressive disorder, as long as it is used with a certain frequency and is administered before 10 AM [<a href=""#ref14"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref14"">14</a>-<a href=""#ref16"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref16"">16</a>,<a href=""#ref26"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref26"">26</a>]. It has also been used in the control of nocturnal hyperphagia and has shown reductions in the percentage of food eaten after dinner and in the number of nocturnal meals eaten per week, reducing the rate of overweight and obesity, as well as being used in the control of fatigue, where it has shown a reduction in the feeling of tiredness [<a href=""#ref29"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref29"">29</a>].</p>"
"<p>Music therapy applied to adults [<a href=""#ref24"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref24"">24</a>] has been shown to be effective in physical and mental relaxation, reducing anxious and depressive symptoms and promoting well-being in a conscious and healthy way [<a href=""#ref30"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref30"">30</a>]. Listening to soothing noises and classical music associated with rhythmic breathing produced a significantly higher rate of adherence to major depressive disorder treatment, especially in the patients with the highest severity [<a href=""#ref31"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref31"">31</a>-<a href=""#ref33"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref33"">33</a>].</p>"
"<p>A study has shown that anhedonia and clinically significant depressive symptoms can be resistant to standard treatment but adjuvant treatment with high-frequency inaudible sound therapy increases the reward of related brain circuits and has a synergistic effect on anhedonia [<a href=""#ref31"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref31"">31</a>]. Integrating music therapy with conventional major depressive disorder treatment (therapies and medication) gives people the opportunity to get in touch with their emotions and provides distraction and a means of communication capable of overcoming barriers and limits to verbal expression [<a href=""#ref30"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref30"">30</a>].</p>"
"<p>Yoga [<a href=""#ref29"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref29"">29</a>,<a href=""#ref34"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref34"">34</a>,<a href=""#ref35"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref35"">35</a>] has been a beneficial exercise for managing sleep quality and other symptoms of major depressive disorder [<a href=""#ref25"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref25"">25</a>,<a href=""#ref36"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref36"">36</a>]. It is an important tool for promoting self-care and, consequently, care for everything around the patient [<a href=""#ref37"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref37"">37</a>]. A study carried out to explore the experiences of patients with major depressive disorder showed that practicing yoga as a self-management strategy helped them gain better insights into their own condition, improving the quality of their health care [<a href=""#ref37"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref37"">37</a>].</p>"
"<p>Tai chi has been shown to be more effective than traditional rehabilitation (psychotropic drugs and therapies) in relation to insomnia, with an improvement in the quality, duration, and efficiency of sleep and a reduction in thoughts of guilt associated with major depressive disorder [<a href=""#ref17"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref17"">17</a>,<a href=""#ref29"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref29"">29</a>,<a href=""#ref38"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref38"">38</a>].

"<p>With regard to herbal medicines, St John’s wort, <em>chai hu</em>, and <em>gancao</em> were the most widely used.

"<p>In more severe cases, practicing physical activity can be difficult for people with major depressive disorder [<a href=""#ref55"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref55"">55</a>]. This can compromise adherence and long-term permanence in the exercise program [<a href=""#ref52"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref52"">52</a>]. It is recommended to prescribe structured exercises based on the activities already practiced by the patient to reduce obstacles [<a href=""#ref33"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref33"">33</a>].</p>"
"<p>Another group of therapeutic guidelines that were also commonly identified in this review were psychotherapies. Mindfulness-based therapy [<a href=""#ref58"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref58"">58</a>,<a href=""#ref59"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref59"">59</a>] is a promising therapeutic approach for treating major depressive disorder and is part of the list of integrative and complementary practices [<a href=""#ref26"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref26"">26</a>,<a href=""#ref37"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref37"">37</a>,<a href=""#ref60"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref60"">60</a>]. It combines elements of therapeutic guidelines [<a href=""#ref22"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref22"">22</a>,<a href=""#ref61"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref61"">61</a>] with the aim of helping people develop a full awareness of the present moment, accepting and acknowledging their thoughts, emotions, and bodily sensations without judgment [<a href=""#ref62"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref62"">62</a>] and learning to observe their negative thoughts and dysfunctional thought patterns without allowing themselves to be involved with or controlled by them [<a href=""#ref63"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref63"">63</a>].</p>"
"<p>Mindfulness improves self-management of prodromal symptoms [<a href=""#ref64"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref64"">64</a>], represents a stability factor when practiced frequently and in a supervised manner [<a href=""#ref28"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref28"">28</a>], positively influences memory and distorted feelings of guilt, increases cognitive resilience, balances mood and sleep, reduces high levels of stress, and improves self-esteem and anxiety [<a href=""#ref65"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref65"">65</a>] associated with major depressive disorder relapse.</p>"
"<p>Similarly, cognitive behavioral psychotherapy [<a href=""#ref26"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref26"">26</a>,<a href=""#ref66"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref66"">66</a>] uses positive reinforcement techniques and systematic desensitization, helping people cope with stress, face the challenges of everyday life, change negative thought patterns and behaviors to more realistic and positive ones [<a href=""#ref23"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref23"">23</a>,<a href=""#ref67"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref67"">67</a>], and identify the first signs of relapse and prevent it as it focuses on social skill training [<a href=""#ref68"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref68"">68</a>,<a href=""#ref69"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref69"">69</a>]. Recently, online cognitive behavioral psychotherapy has been shown to be effective for depressed and angry mood as a cost-effective treatment modality for major depressive disorder [<a href=""#ref70"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref70"">70</a>].</p>"
"<p>Other psychotherapies aimed at influencing the person with major depressive disorder and helping them modify emotional, cognitive, and behavioral problems were self-efficacy psychotherapy [<a href=""#ref46"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref46"">46</a>]; competitive memory training [<a href=""#ref71"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref71"">71</a>]; guided self-help psychotherapy [<a href=""#ref23"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref23"">23</a>,<a href=""#ref72"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref72"">72</a>]; behavioral activation [<a href=""#ref69"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref69"">69</a>,<a href=""#ref73"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref73"">73</a>]; interpersonal psychotherapy [<a href=""#ref38"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref38"">38</a>,<a href=""#ref57"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref57"">57</a>,<a href=""#ref67"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref67"">67</a>]; psychotherapy focused on problem-solving [<a href=""#ref29"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref29"">29</a>,<a href=""#ref38"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref38"">38</a>,<a href=""#ref74"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref74"">74</a>]; and therapy focused on acceptance, commitment, and emotion [<a href=""#ref62"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref62"">62</a>,<a href=""#ref75"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref75"">75</a>].</p>"
"<p>Leisure time or pleasurable activities as a social practice, contrary to what is often thought, are not only carried out during the summer or on vacation but also in between daily obligations [<a href=""#ref37"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref37"">37</a>]. Thus, they can take the form of individual or group dynamics, whether it is reading a book, listening to music, or going for a walk with friends [<a href=""#ref37"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref37"">37</a>,<a href=""#ref50"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref50"">50</a>]. The relationship between leisure and health has fostered new techniques for the treatment of depressive disorders with the aim of enabling the individual’s psychic and social readaptation [<a href=""#ref37"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref37"">37</a>,<a href=""#ref50"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref50"">50</a>].</p>"
"<p>Painting for leisure, for example, can promote the manifestation of feelings through emotions expressed verbally or not, thus helping understand the mind and its sorrows [<a href=""#ref38"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref38"">38</a>]. In this sense, of the possibilities for leisure activities recommended by the professionals who collaborated with the data found, art therapy [<a href=""#ref40"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref40"">40</a>], group and individual outings [<a href=""#ref41"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref41"">41</a>,<a href=""#ref50"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref50"">50</a>], trips [<a href=""#ref38"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref38"">38</a>], reading books and watching movies [<a href=""#ref37"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref37"">37</a>,<a href=""#ref38"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref38"">38</a>], listening to music [<a href=""#ref31"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref31"">31</a>], and attending religious institutions [<a href=""#ref50"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref50"">50</a>] were the most cited in the studies.</p>"
"<p>In the context of pharmacological treatment, antidepressants associated with psychotherapies [<a href=""#ref26"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref26"">26</a>,<a href=""#ref29"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref29"">29</a>,<a href=""#ref37"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref37"">37</a>] should be administered with caution and under medical supervision [<a href=""#ref20"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref20"">20</a>,<a href=""#ref38"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref38"">38</a>,<a href=""#ref41"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref41"">41</a>] based on the therapeutic alliance, clinical history, monitoring and reassessment of psychiatric conditions, and adequacy of the diagnosis, and guidance should be provided for families [<a href=""#ref28"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref28"">28</a>,<a href=""#ref57"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref57"">57</a>].</p>"
"<p>In 5% (3/62) of the studies, the association of psychotropic drugs with therapeutic guidelines was highlighted (due to the severity of the major depressive disorder clinical picture) even in the face of difficulties with medication adherence for different reasons [<a href=""#ref16"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref16"">16</a>,<a href=""#ref29"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref29"">29</a>,<a href=""#ref38"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref38"">38</a>], which should be anticipated and addressed proactively in every contact with the patient. Approximately 30% to 40% of people using antidepressants still do not respond as expected to treatment [<a href=""#ref27"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref27"">27</a>,<a href=""#ref41"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref41"">41</a>].</p>"
"<p>Relaxation techniques appeared in this review as a more appropriate way of coping with the psychological, environmental, and social stimuli that people with major depressive disorder may face. Among these strategies, breathing techniques [<a href=""#ref16"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref16"">16</a>,<a href=""#ref26"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref26"">26</a>,<a href=""#ref27"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref27"">27</a>,<a href=""#ref29"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref29"">29</a>,<a href=""#ref30"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref30"">30</a>,<a href=""#ref36"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref36"">36</a>], progressive muscle relaxation [<a href=""#ref33"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref33"">33</a>,<a href=""#ref41"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref41"">41</a>,<a href=""#ref66"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref66"">66</a>], massages [<a href=""#ref29"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref29"">29</a>,<a href=""#ref41"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref41"">41</a>,<a href=""#ref66"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref66"">66</a>], stretching [<a href=""#ref16"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref16"">16</a>,<a href=""#ref26"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref26"">26</a>,<a href=""#ref27"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref27"">27</a>,<a href=""#ref29"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref29"">29</a>,<a href=""#ref66"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref66"">66</a>], a warm bath [<a href=""#ref16"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref16"">16</a>], and meditation [<a href=""#ref30"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref30"">30</a>] were the most cited.</p>"
"<p>In the context of major depressive disorder, these techniques promote muscle relaxation, relieve stress and tension, rebalance emotions, produce hormones such as endorphins, provide a sense of well-being, and significantly improve sleep quality [<a href=""#ref16"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref16"">16</a>]. Incorporating these practices throughout the day or even before going to bed helps people let go of tiredness, become aware of the present moment, and pay attention to their own bodies [<a href=""#ref16"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref16"">16</a>,<a href=""#ref66"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref66"">66</a>].</p>"
"<p>Finally, therapeutic guidelines for psychoeducation or professional counseling can be used to help with self-management as major depressive disorder generates changes in the family system and structure [<a href=""#ref16"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref16"">16</a>,<a href=""#ref18"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref18"">18</a>,<a href=""#ref26"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref26"">26</a>,<a href=""#ref36"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref36"">36</a>,<a href=""#ref38"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref38"">38</a>], resulting in the need for clarification to relieve anxieties and doubts to improve the psychological well-being of the patient [<a href=""#ref20"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref20"">20</a>,<a href=""#ref37"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref37"">37</a>,<a href=""#ref42"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref42"">42</a>,<a href=""#ref43"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref43"">43</a>].</p>"
"<p>Thus, the wide variety of therapeutic guidelines found can increase knowledge about the symptoms and aspects of major depressive disorder, allowing the person to self-manage symptoms such as fatigue, sleep disturbances, anhedonia, and mood swings [<a href=""#ref16"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref16"">16</a>,<a href=""#ref27"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref27"">27</a>,<a href=""#ref29"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref29"">29</a>,<a href=""#ref66"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref66"">66</a>] in a more responsible and autonomous way.</p>"
"<p>These therapeutic guidelines are characterized by providing information on the diagnosis, etiology, prognosis, and course of the illness; the identification of early signs of crisis; the importance of adherence to medication or psychosocial treatment; the promotion of healthy habits and regularity in lifestyle (sleep, diet, physical activity, and substance use); and how to deal with the stigmatization, doubts, fears, and myths regarding major depressive disorder [<a href=""#ref23"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref23"">23</a>,<a href=""#ref41"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref41"">41</a>,<a href=""#ref42"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref42"">42</a>].</p>"
"<p>Therefore, the implications for practice are based on the fact that therapeutic guidelines help in the self-management of major depressive disorder through behavioral, social, and emotional changes that allow for better construction of clinical reasoning, adaptation, autonomy, coping, and improvement of general health.</p>"
"<p>The limitations of this scoping review are related to the nature of the review itself as its aim was to provide an overview of therapeutic guidelines, which may not be sufficient for the self-management of major depressive disorder as it is a complex clinical condition with a heterogeneity of symptoms. Furthermore, despite efforts to develop a comprehensive search strategy, it was difficult to find controlled and uncontrolled descriptors for the term “therapeutic guidelines,” which is not an indexed descriptor.</p>"
"<p>By analyzing the methodological approach adopted in this study, and in accordance with the proposed objectives, it was possible to highlight a set of therapeutic guidelines to support a person’s self-management in the context of major depressive disorder symptoms. This does not preclude further study of their effectiveness in the self-management of major depressive disorder symptoms but demonstrates their contribution to promoting self-management of major depressive disorder and their power to prevent possible complications.</p>"
"<p>Self-management is a promising strategy that emphasizes the person’s responsibility in the care process. It goes beyond participation in health care interactions and includes dealing with symptoms and disability; managing medication and monitoring indicators; maintaining adequate levels of nutrition and exercise; and adjusting to psychological, social, and lifestyle demands.</p>"
"<p>These therapeutic guidelines can be applied by all members of a multi-professional mental health team, including nurses, provided they are trained as resources to help the person acquire new knowledge, behaviors, and skills for self-management. These guidelines are also an important resource for health professionals in their role as facilitators of a person’s development of knowledge and skills to ensure their capacity for self-management.</p>"

"<p id=""P3"">The phenomenology and neurobiology of depressive symptoms in anxious youth is poorly understood.</p>"
"<p id=""P4"">Association networks of anxiety and depressive symptoms were developed in adolescents with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD; <em>N</em>=52, mean age: 15.4±1.6 years) who had not yet developed major depressive disorder. Community analyses were used to create consensus clusters of depressive and anxiety symptoms and to identify “bridge” symptoms between the clusters. In a subset of this sample (<em>n=39)</em>, correlations between cortical thickness and depressive symptom severity was examined.</p>"
"<p id=""P5"">Ten symptoms clustered into an anxious community, 5 clustered into a depressive community and 5 bridged the two communities: impaired schoolwork, excessive weeping, low self-esteem, disturbed appetite, and physical symptoms of depression. Patients with more depressive cluster burden had altered cortical thickness in prefrontal, inferior and medial parietal (<em>e.g.</em>, precuneus, supramarginal) regions and had decreases in cortical thickness-age relationships in prefrontal, temporal and parietal cortices.</p>"
"<p id=""P6"">Data are cross-sectional and observational. Limited sample size precluded secondary analysis of comorbidities and demographics.</p>"
"<p id=""P7"">In youth with GAD, a sub-set of symptoms not directly related to anxiety bridge anxiety and depression. Youth with greater depressive cluster burden had altered cortical thickness in cortical structures within the default mode and central executive networks. These alternations in cortical thickness may represent a distinct neurostructural fingerprint in anxious youth with early depressive symptoms. Finally, youth with GAD and high depressive symptoms had reduced age-cortical thickness correlations. The emergence of depressive symptoms in early GAD and cortical development may have bidirectional, neurobiological relationships.</p>"

"<p id=""P8"">Anxiety disorders—which frequently emerge in childhood or adolescence—typically precede the onset of depressive symptoms (<a href=""#R11"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R11"">Bittner et al., 2004</a>) and increase the risk of developing major depressive disorder (MDD) (<a href=""#R7"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R7"">Beesdo et al., 2010</a>). Moreover, anxiety disorders, when they co-occur in depressed youth, increase morbidity and treatment resistance beyond what might be expected with either MDD or an anxiety disorder alone. Indeed, the combination of these disorders increase the likelihood of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts (<a href=""#R37"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R37"">Husky et al., 2012</a>). Yet, little is known regarding: (1) risk factors for developing depressive symptoms in adolescents with anxiety disorders and (2) how features of an anxiety disorders are linked to early depressive symptoms.</p>"
"<p id=""P9"">Prior work demonstrated that anxiety disorders increase the risk of developing depressive disorders. Three reports from the Early Developmental Study of Psychopathology (EDSP) (<a href=""#R87"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R87"">Wittchen et al., 1998</a>) reveal that certain anxiety disorders (<em>i.e.</em>, social anxiety disorder), when present in adolescence, increase the risk of developing MDD in early adulthood (<a href=""#R72"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R72"">Stein et al., 2001</a>). Additional analyses of this sample (<a href=""#R11"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R11"">Bittner et al., 2004</a>) reveal that social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, agoraphobia and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) increase the risk of developing depressive disorders while having multiple anxiety disorders, more severe impairment, comorbid panic attacks specifically contribute to this risk of developing MDD. Interestingly, the severity of anxiety-related impairment represents the strongest independent predictor of developing MDD (OR: 2.2 [95% CI: 1.0 to 4.4]) (<a href=""#R11"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R11"">Bittner et al., 2004</a>). Also in this cohort, more than half of individuals who had social anxiety disorder during adolescence developed MDD during the follow-up period (OR: 3.2 [95% CI: 2.5 to 4.1]) (<a href=""#R5"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R5"">Beesdo et al., 2007</a>) and social anxiety disorder represented the first disorder to emerge in most of these patients. Providing further evidence of the temporal association of depressive and anxiety disorders, the age-of-onset distribution for GAD parallels the age-of-onset distribution for depressive disorders although the age-of-onset distribution for GAD emerges 2 years earlier than that of the depressive disorders (<a href=""#R7"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R7"">Beesdo et al., 2010</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P10"">Studies that examine GAD and MDD as distinct disorders are complicated by diagnostic, phenomenologic, epidemiologic and clinical issues. First, diagnostic criteria for GAD and MDD overlap (<em>e.g.</em>, dyssomnia, fatigue or low energy, and poor concentration). Second, these overlapping symptoms and features such as interference with schoolwork, somatic symptoms and appetite disturbances are assessed in rating scales for both depressive and anxiety disorders (<a href=""#R10"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R10"">Birmaher et al., 1997</a>; <a href=""#R40"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R40"">Isa et al., 2014</a>; <a href=""#R46"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R46"">Kovacs, 1985</a>; <a href=""#R50"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R50"">March et al., 1997</a>; <a href=""#R57"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R57"">Mossman et al., 2017</a>). Third, multiple formulations have been offered to explain this comorbidity. Tyrer, <em>et al</em>, for example, have proposed that MDD and GAD when present concurrently in the same patient should constitute a distinct diagnosis of “cothymia” (<a href=""#R82"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R82"">Tyrer et al., 2001</a>). Indeed, given shared symptoms, genetic risk factors, and psychopharmocologic interventions some have argued MDD and GAD are differing phenotypes of a similar underlying genotype perhaps due to separate environmental triggers (<a href=""#R43"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R43"">Kendler, 1996</a>; <a href=""#R44"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R44"">Kendler et al., 2007</a>; <a href=""#R68"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R68"">Roy et al., 1995</a>). However, more recent studies (<a href=""#R45"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R45"">Kessler et al., 2008</a>) have argued against this conceptualization given each disorder’s distinct risk factors. GAD and MDD share certain risk factors (e.g., childhood adversity and harm avoidance appear) (<a href=""#R7"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R7"">Beesdo et al., 2010</a>; <a href=""#R14"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R14"">Blanco et al., 2014</a>). However, family history of GAD, behavioral inhibition, childhood separation events, and parental overprotection specifically increase the risk of developing anxiety disorders. Likewise, parental depression, low parental emotional warmth, and parental rejection are specifically associated with the development of MDD (<a href=""#R7"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R7"">Beesdo et al., 2010</a>). Finally, a 15 year, longitudinal study of young adults (aged 19-20 years) suggests that anxiety disorders increase the likelihood of developing anxious-depression or depressive disorders (<a href=""#R54"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R54"">Merikangas et al., 2003</a>). Disorder-specific risk was not evaluated (<em>e.g.</em>, unique risk associated with panic disorder <em>vs.</em> generalized anxiety disorder vs. social anxiety disorder).</p>"
"<p id=""P11"">Multiple biological, environmental and social factors influence the complex relationship between depressive and anxiety symptoms during childhood and adolescence. Anxiety symptoms in children (<em>N</em>=2220) who were prospectively followed from late childhood through late adolescence, initially decreased from age 10 until age 12-14 and then increased during mid-to-late adolescence (<a href=""#R83"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R83"">Van Oort et al., 2009</a>). In these adolescents, sex affects anxiety symptom severity and this effect appears to contribute to the severity of depressive symptoms, while time-dependent variability in anxiety and depressive symptoms differ significantly between sexes. Thus, anxiety symptoms appear to predict later depressive symptoms in youth but the mechanism of this phenomenon remains poorly understood (<a href=""#R83"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R83"">Van Oort et al., 2009</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P12"">Few studies have evaluated the neurobiology of depressive symptoms in youth with anxiety disorders. Most prior work in youth has focused on the functional neurocircuitry of either MDD or anxiety disorders. These studies have observed non-disorder specific differences in amygdala activation (i.e., amygdala hyperactivation in both MDD and anxiety disorders), but differences in task-specific amygdala activation in youth with MDD and those with anxiety disorders (<a href=""#R7"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R7"">Beesdo et al., 2009</a>). Additionally, in a sample of youth who were at risk for developing MDD (<em>e.g.</em>, parental history of MDD), (<a href=""#R56"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R56"">Monk et al., 2008</a>) functional differences were observed in the amygdala and nucleus accumbens. However, in this small sample, 59% of the at risk youth had a history of an anxiety disorder; this high prevalence precluded specific examination of the neurofunctional risk contribution of anxiety disorders and the “contribution of anxiety disorders to neural perturbations in at-risk individuals” could not be specifically determined (<a href=""#R56"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R56"">Monk et al., 2008</a>). Neurostructural evaluations of anxious depression are rare in children, despite numerous studies of the neurostructural basis of anxiety disorders and depressive disorders (as separate conditions) (<a href=""#R1"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R1"">Adleman et al., 2012</a>; <a href=""#R32"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R32"">Gold et al., 2016</a>; <a href=""#R58"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R58"">Mueller et al., 2013</a>; <a href=""#R73"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R73"">Strawn et al., 2015</a>, <a href=""#R74"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R74"">2014</a>). In one voxel-based morphometry study of adolescents with anxiety disorders, depressive disorders or anxiety disorders + MDD (anxious depression), adolescents with anxious depression exhibited decreased gray matter volumes in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex compared to patients with MDD alone, while compared to healthy subjects, adolescents with anxious depression had increased gray matter volumes in the pre- and post-central gyri (<a href=""#R84"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R84"">Wehry et al., 2015</a>). To date, no studies have examined the neurobiology of depressive symptoms in youth with anxiety disorders.</p>"
"<p id=""P13"">To explore the relationship between depressive and anxiety symptom clusters, we focused on patients with GAD. The decision to focus on GAD was based on (1) symptomatic distinctiveness of GAD from other anxiety disorders with overlapping symptoms (<a href=""#R16"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R16"">Cho et al., 2019</a>) (2) reliability and validity of the diagnosis in adolescents (<a href=""#R47"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R47"">Lyneham et al., 2007</a>; <a href=""#R64"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R64"">Rappaport et al., 2017</a>); (3) evidence that it is distinct from depressive disorders (<a href=""#R20"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R20"">Cummings et al., 2014</a>); longitudinal stability during childhood, adolescence and early adulthood (<a href=""#R7"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R7"">Beesdo et al., 2010</a>). Beyond this, most <em>DSM-5</em> anxiety disorders in youth have specific foci (<em>e.g.</em>, separation from a primary attachment figure in separation anxiety disorder, fear of humiliation or embarrassment in social anxiety disorder) whereas the anxiety that typifies GAD is diffuse and prototypic of central cognitive aspects of anxiety—“repetitive chains of thoughts about potentially adverse consequences of issues that present with some degree of uncertainty” (<a href=""#R16"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R16"">Cho et al., 2019</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P14"">Although the comorbidity of anxiety disorders and major depression in youth has been extensively studied (<a href=""#R20"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R20"">Cummings et al., 2014</a>), there are substantial knowledge gaps regarding subthreshold depressive symptoms in anxious youth. Identifying specific symptoms that bridge anxiety and depressive disorders in anxious youth, will inform early intervention development and precision medicine approaches. Targeted screening could prevent the development of depressive disorders and decrease the morbidity of anxiety and depressive disorders. With these considerations in mind, we sought to (1) identify predictors of depressive symptoms in adolescents with a primary anxiety disorder; (2) explore potential associations among features of anxiety and depressive symptoms; and (3) examine neurostructural correlates of depressive symptoms in anxious youth.</p>"

"<p id=""P16"">Study participants (<em>N</em>=52) were outpatient youth aged 12 through 17 years who met <em>DSM-IV-TR</em> criteria for GAD, assessed by unstructured and semi-structured assessments by a board-certified child and adolescent psychiatrist (JRS). The diagnosis of GAD was confirmed with the <em>Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM-IV</em> (<em>ADIS-IV</em>) (<a href=""#R71"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R71"">Silverman et al., 2001</a>). We included only patients who met criteria for GAD and excluded patients with MDD or PTSD. Patients treated with psychotropic medications were not included. Patients with active substance abuse or dependence within the past 6 months were excluded and patients had a negative urine drug screen. Data used for this study was extracted from the screening phase of a randomized controlled trial of escitalopram in the treatment of GAD including functional neuroimaging before and during escitalopram treatment. Importantly, not all patient who were screened were randomized. Results and further detail regarding this randomized controlled trial were recently published (<a href=""#R75"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R75"">Strawn et al., 2020</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P17"">Demographic data including age, sex, and race were collected. Additionally, pubertal status was determined using the Duke Self-Rated Tanner Scale (Self Report) (<a href=""#R25"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R25"">Duke et al., 1980</a>). The CGI-S, a clinician-administered instrument of global severity—which is performed by a clinician—is based both on observed and reported symptoms, functional impairment and behavior over a 7 day period (<a href=""#R34"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R34"">Guy, 1976</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P18"">The <em>Children’s Depression Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R)</em> is a 18-item semi-structured, interview-based assessment is commonly employed in clinical research to monitor depressive symptom severity in youth (<a href=""#R66"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R66"">Rintelmann et al., 1996</a>). Each item represents a feature or symptom of depression: <em>(1) impaired schoolwork (difficulty with concentration); (2) difficulty having fun (anhedonia); (3) social withdrawal; (4) sleep disturbance; (5) appetite disturbance; (6) excessive fatigue; (7) physical complaints; (8) irritability; (9) excessive guilt; (10) low self-esteem, (11) depressed mood; (12) morbid ideation; (13) suicidal ideation; (14) excessive weeping; (15) depressed facial affect; (16) listless speech</em> and (17) <em>hypoactivity.</em> These items are rated from 1 to 5 or 1 to 7 (total possible raw score range: 17-113). For the purposes of imaging analysis, we used the CDRS-R to categorize patients into “high” and “low” burdens of depressive symptoms which we defined as CDRS-R score greater than or less than to our sample-specific median, 35.</p>"
"<p id=""P19"">The Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale (PARS), is a clinician-rated instrument that is commonly used in clinical trials of anxious youth, queries anxiety symptoms, severity, and impairment (RUPP, 2002). The PARS consists of 7 sub-scales, each rated 1-5, including: <em>overall number of anxiety symptoms</em> (based on a symptom checklist), <em>overall frequency of anxiety symptoms, overall severity of anxiety feelings, overall severity of physical symptoms of anxiety, overall avoidance of anxiety-provoking situations, interference with family relationships and/or performance at home, and interference with peer and adult relationships and/or performance outside of home</em>.</p>"
"<p id=""P20"">Descriptive statistics were calculated using Microsoft Excel. All statistical analyses were performed in <em>R</em> (version 3.4.2). First, Pearson’s correlation coefficients calculated for each pairwise combination of the following: (1) total PARS score, (2) each PARS item, and (3) each CDRS item. Based on this correlation matrix, association networks were created using <em>qgraph</em> (R package). Each partial correlation coefficient then constituted an “edge” for the association network while each symptom subscale represented a “node.” <em>qgraph</em> uses the Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm (<a href=""#R30"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R30"">Fruchterman and Reingold, 1991</a>), ported from the SNA package (<a href=""#R15"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R15"">Butts, 2010</a>) to create a force-directed layout which clusters correlated nodes and prevents overlapping edges. This algorithm causes all nodes to repulse each other while correlated or connected nodes also attract each other. The result is a representation of the network of symptoms in which highly correlated nodes visually ‘cluster’ together in proportion to their correlational coefficient. We included only edges with partial correlations greater than 0.25, a cutoff used in previous network analyses (<a href=""#R26"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R26"">Epskamp et al., 2018</a>; <a href=""#R41"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R41"">Jones et al., 2018</a>) to limit spurious correlations. Networks were developed to contain (1) PARS and CDRS sub-scales, as well as (2) <em>total</em> PARS score and CDRS sub-scales. A sensitivity analysis examining the associations between age and each node in the association network was performed to assess the impact of age on depressive and anxious symptoms was also performed.</p>"
"<p id=""P21"">We performed a community analysis to assess which anxiety and depressive symptoms formed highly correlated clusters. This approach has been previously used to identify syndromic networks of psychopathology (<a href=""#R67"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R67"">Robinaugh et al., 2014</a>).

Images were acquired with a repetition time (TR) of 6.8 ms, an echo time (TE) of 2.9 ms, a flip angle of 9°; a matrix size of 256 x 256, a field of view of 256×256×160 mm.</p>"
"<p id=""P23"">Initial image processing was completed automatically using FreeSurfer package 6.0.0 (<a href=""http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu"" class=""usa-link usa-link--external"" data-ga-action=""click_feat_suppl"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu</a>). Processing included motion correction, averaging of multiple volumetric T1 weighted images, skull striping using a deformable template model, automated registration to Talairach space, segmentation of subcortical white matter and deep gray matter volumetric structures, normalization of intensity, tessellation of the gray matter, and white matter boundaries, automated topology correction and surface deformation (based on intensity gradients to optimally place the gray/white and gray/cerebrospinal fluid borders) (<a href=""#R27"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R27"">Fischl et al., 2002</a>). The segmentation procedure was visually inspected for inaccuracies (HKS, MJL), and manual corrections were performed as needed by incorporating control points. This was followed by surface inflation and registration to a spherical atlas (based on subject cortical folding patterns) to harmonize the cortical geometry across the patients. The cerebral cortex was subsequently auto-parcellated into 34 different gyral regions per hemisphere using gyral and sulcal anatomy as previously described (<a href=""#R22"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R22"">Desikan et al., 2006</a>). Individual cortical reconstructions were smoothed using a Gaussian kernel of 10mm FWHM and fit to an average subject through recognition of cortical curvature for visualization of results. Differences in cortical thickness, at each vertex of the cortical surface, between groups (see next section) were determined using a general linear model (GLM). This was performed in Freesurfer’s QDEC (Query, Design, Estimate, Contrast) graphic user interface using a cross-subject GLM with a different offset different slope (DODS) design matrix that co-varied for age with gender as a nuisance factor. A vertex-wise threshold of p&lt;0.001 was used and, to correct for multiple comparisons, a Monte Carlo simulation with 10,000 iterations was used to identify findings at a cluster-level significance threshold of 0.05, as previously described (<a href=""#R74"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R74"">Strawn et al., 2014</a>; <a href=""#R78"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R78"">Sylvester et al., 2016</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P24"">To investigate distinct anatomic correlates of depressive symptoms (<em>i.e.</em>, the core depressive symptoms identified in the community analysis), anxious adolescents were divided into 2 groups (“high” and “low” depressive symptoms) based on a core CDRS score greater than or less than 35—the median core CDRS-R score in our sample. These groups were then evaluated with regard to differences in cortical thickness as described in <em>Image Processing.</em> Additionally, to understand the neurodevelopmental effects of depressive symptoms in this age range and given that this period of time—adolescence—represents a critical neurodevelopmental period, we performed a <em>post-hoc</em> analysis of age-cortical thickness relationships in anxious adolescents with high core depressive symptoms and a separate analysis of age-cortical thickness relationship in those with low levels of core depressive symptoms (<em>i.e.</em>, “high” and “low” depressive symptom groups). A dichotomous approach to our analysis was chosen due to concern that a continuous analysis may be more sensitive to multicollinearity given the multidimensionality of our measures, however it should be noted that dichotomization of continuous variables can lead to several disadvantages including decreased power and loss of patient-level information (<a href=""#R48"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R48"">MacCallum et al., 2002</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P25"">Of the 52 patients included in this analysis, 40 were female (76.9%) and 12 were male (23.1%).

The patients were aged 15.4±1.6 years and all patients were post-pubertal (12.2% Tanner 3, 42.9% Tanner 4, 42.9% Tanner 5). Family history was available for 51 of the 52 patients in this study. Among these, many patients had a family history of a first degree relative with an anxiety disorder (66.6%) or with major depressive disorder (37.3%).

Anxiety symptoms were moderate to severe as reflected by a total PARS score of 25.2±3.7 (clinical trial scoring: 19.1±2.7). The average CGI-S score was 4.2 ± 1.0.

"<p id=""P31"">This study is the first to identify a constellation of symptoms that correlatively “bridge” clusters of anxiety and depressive symptoms in adolescents with primary anxiety disorders. Understanding the putative links between clusters of anxiety and depressive symptoms in younger patients provides insights into this relationship <em>before</em> it is modified by the onset of full, syndromic MDD. From a developmental psychopathology standpoint, bridging symptoms (<em>e.g.</em>, excessive weeping, low self-esteem, impaired schoolwork, appetite disturbances, and physical symptoms), early in the course of illness may play critical roles in the pathogenesis of depressive disorders in youth with anxiety disorders and may represent specific treatment targets. Additionally, our findings of two distinct symptom clusters representing anxious and depressive symptoms extend the findings of a longitudinal symptom network study, which focused on a broader and younger population (age 5-14 years) of developing children rather than those with anxiety disorders. In this prior analysis, maternally-reported depressive and anxious symptoms did not form distinct networks and symptoms highly correlated regardless of which diagnostic family to which a symptom belonged (<a href=""#R52"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R52"">McElroy et al., 2018</a>). Taken together with the current findings, clustering of depressive and anxiety symptoms may emerge following the onset of an anxiety disorder.</p>"
"<p id=""P32"">For nearly two centuries, psychiatric diagnoses have been based on the identification of symptom clusters that represent reported and observed symptoms. Within the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5)</em>, (<a href=""#R2"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R2"">American Psychiatric Association, 2013</a>) diagnoses represent the consensus of symptom clusters which represent distinct disorders. This approach represents the backbone of structured diagnostic assessments and the <em>DSM</em>, however, it has been challenged in recent years. The last decade saw dimensional approaches (<em>e.g., Research Domain Criteria [RDoC])</em> to psychiatric illness based on domains and valence which promised to elucidate the pathoetiology of these disorders at genetic, molecular, circuit and behavioral levels (<a href=""#R38"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R38"">Insel, et al., 2010</a>; <a href=""#R39"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R39"">Insel et al., 2015</a>). Although both RDoC and cluster-based (i.e., conventional) constructs classify psychiatric illnesses based on empirical data, cluster-based approaches focus on reported symptoms (<em>e.g.</em> excessive guilt or anhedonia) or observed signs (<em>e.g.</em>, psychomotor retardation or agitation). By contrast, RDoC focuses on “dimensions of <em>observable</em> behavior and neurobiological measures” with little attention given to subjective experience of patients (<a href=""#R21"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R21"">Cuthbert, 2015</a>). Implementation of such construct-based based on specific domains (<em>i.e.</em>, RDoC approaches) raises concerns with regard to (1) underlying developmental processes, (2) classification of specific disorders within a dimensional framework, (3) shared symptoms as well as circuits (<a href=""#R28"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R28"">Franklin et al., 2015</a>). Additionally, some argued that RDoC approaches are problematic an create biological reductionism (<a href=""#R28"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R28"">Franklin et al., 2015</a>). Regardless of whether neurobiologically based constructs such as RDoC or a symptom-focused cluster-based construct are preferred, it is imperative that both the unique symptomatology of disorders in youth and symptoms linking comorbid diagnoses are considered in research settings and in the clinic.</p>"
"<p id=""P33"">The analyses presented herein suggest the validity of cluster-based constructs. Specifically, we observed that patients with predominantly anxiety-related symptoms included all seven PARS items as well as dysomnia and fatigue whereas a second group featured predominantly of depression-related symptoms and included listless speech, depressed affect, hypoactivity, depressed mood, and anhedonia. The symptoms in the depressive cluster are specific for depression and include anhedonia and depressed mood—core depressive symptoms. Within the depressive cluster, anhedonia is the only directly linked symptom to the anxiety cluster (through anxiety-related distress). Given the link between anxiety-related distress and anhedonia (but not depressed mood), the emergence of anhedonia in anxious youth may be a more sensitive risk marker for developing MDD than depressed mood. This finding is consistent with lower animal studies in which chronic stress reduces dopamine release in response to pleasurable stimuli (<a href=""#R23"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R23"">Di Chiara et al., 1999</a>) and decreases engagement in pleasurable activities (<a href=""#R60"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R60"">Papp et al., 1991</a>; <a href=""#R81"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R81"">Treadway and Zald, 2011</a>). Therefore, a treatment focusing on discriminating between rewarding and non-rewarding behaviors, such as behavioral activation, may be useful in preventing the development of depression in at-risk anxious youth (<a href=""#R81"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R81"">Treadway and Zald, 2011</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P34"">We identified five symptoms that bridge depression and anxiety clusters (low self-esteem, impaired schoolwork, appetite disturbances, physical symptoms of depression (CDRS-R) and excessive weeping). Some of these symptoms (<em>e.g.</em>, self-esteem and excessive weeping) represent sequelae of anxiety (<em>e.g.</em>, crying in times of severe anxiety or when experiencing anxiety-related distress when being overwhelmed by anxiety, etc.). Additionally, some bridging symptoms reflect functional impairment (<em>e.g.</em>, impaired schoolwork) and could be attributed to either the anxiety disorder or to an emerging depressive disorder. To this end, both severe anxious symptoms and emerging depressive symptoms could result in poor schoolwork but would not necessarily be due to the same underlying symptoms or disease process. Specific bridge symptoms (<em>e.g.</em>, impaired schoolwork) may lend themselves to specific intervention (<em>i.e.</em>, increased educational support and accommodations). Many of these symptoms can be recognized and reported by family members (<em>e.g.</em>, appetite disturbances, excessive weeping, impaired schoolwork) and thus, clinicians might increase vigilance in monitoring these specific symptoms with the hopes that early identification could forestall the development of MDD. Finally, the bridging role of physical symptoms which represent somatic manifestations of internalizing disorders in pediatric populations (<a href=""#R9"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R9"">Bernstein et al., 1997</a>; <a href=""#R18"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R18"">Crawley et al., 2014</a>; <a href=""#R31"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R31"">Ginsburg et al., 2006</a>), may reflect a shared neurobiologic/psychological etiology. Specifically, in patients with anxiety disorders and in those with depressive disorders, neurostructural and neurofunctional abnormalities in the anterior insula and salience network have been described (<a href=""#R17"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R17"">Craig, 2009</a>; <a href=""#R61"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R61"">Peters et al., 2016</a>). This network processes interoceptive information and somatic afferent signals and the processing of this information is disrupted in both anxiety and depressive disorders. Whether altered interoceptive processing represents a specific endophenotype of youth with anxiety or depressive disorders remains to be determined. At this time, the relationship between abnormal interoceptive functioning and high somatic symptom burden in individuals with anxiety disorders and those who develop depressive symptoms represents a significant void in our understanding of the relationship between anxiety and depression. Importantly, although comorbidities and family history were not significantly related to bridge symptoms, these results should be interpreted with caution given our limited power to detect these differences. Further research with larger samples is needed to elucidate the relationship between genetic loading and various comorbidities and symptoms bridging anxious and depressive symptom clusters.</p>"
"<p id=""P35"">Social withdrawal, a symptom found in our anxiety cluster, is the starting point for a bridge to our depressive cluster (specifically, depressed mood and depressed affect). That social withdrawal begins a cascade leading to depressive symptoms is consistent with previous observations that more than half of patients with social anxiety disorder in childhood or adolescence later develop MDD (<a href=""#R5"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R5"">Beesdo et al., 2007</a>). Importantly, the correlation between social withdrawal and depressed mood and affect is not direct, but rather linked through low self-esteem and excessive weeping. We postulate that future longitudinal studies will find these linking symptoms to precede more frank and specific signs of MDD (<em>i.e.</em>, anhedonia and depressed mood). Further, by addressing low self-esteem, specifically in adolescents with anxiety-related social withdrawal we may thwart the development of depressive disorders in youth with primary anxiety disorders. Similarly, disturbed sleep clustered with other anxiety-related symptoms but form the start point to a bridge to anhedonia, a depressive-cluster symptom. Previous studies have found that sleep deprivation can confer greater risk for psychopathology and medical illness in adolescents and may portend poorer outcomes irrespective of diagnoses (<a href=""#R59"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R59"">Owens, 2014</a>). For this reason, researchers have begun targeting sleep from a transdiagnostic perspective (<a href=""#R24"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R24"">Dong et al., 2020</a>) which could be particularly useful in youth with mixed depressive and anxious symptoms.</p>"
"<p id=""P36"">In anxious adolescents with more depressive symptoms, abnormalities were observed in key cognitive networks including the salience, default mode and ventral attention networks. These three networks have been associated with the pathophysiology of anxiety disorders but also the pathophysiology of depressive disorders in adults and in pediatric populations (<a href=""#R86"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R86"">Williams, 2016</a>). Thus, cortical abnormalities in these regions likely relate to shared cognitive processes and functions. First, we observed cortical thickness differed in the salience network (<em>i.e.</em>, cingulo-opercular network) and specifically within the bilateral superior frontal, left insula, bilateral supramarginal cortex. This network putatively processes negative affect, pain, and cognitive control, (<a href=""#R69"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R69"">Seminowicz et al., 2007</a>; <a href=""#R70"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R70"">Shackman et al., 2011</a>) functions that are shared by both depressive and anxiety disorders. Second, we observed differences in cortical thickness in the bilateral precuneus and cuneus, as well as the bilateral inferior temporal, right posterior cingulate, right medial frontal, left superior temporal cortices. These regions collectively belong to the default mode network which has been implicated in the pathophysiology of both anxiety and depressive disorders (<a href=""#R36"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R36"">Ho et al., 2015</a>; <a href=""#R53"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R53"">McVoy et al., 2019</a>) in children and adolescents. It should be noted that within our sample anxious adolescents with high depressive symptom burden showed relative increased and decreases in cortical thickness contingent on specific foci involved. It has been hypothesized that depressive and anxiety disorder are the result of abnormal trajectories of childhood brain development (<a href=""#R4"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R4"">Bale et al., 2010</a>; <a href=""#R38"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R38"">Insel et al., 2010</a>). Early adolescence is a major period of brain development that is characterized by dynamic structural and functional brain maturation as well as reorganization. While the specific cellular and molecular changes underlying these developmental changes are unknown, likely mechanisms include increasing myelination and axon caliber, pruning and synaptogenesis which have variable importance relative to age and neuroanatomical region (<a href=""#R8"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R8"">Benes et al., 1994</a>; <a href=""#R80"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R80"">Tamnes et al., 2017</a>). These factors ultimately result in region-specific cortical thickness and surface area changes that are likely result from a complex interplay of age, sex, genetic and environmental factors (<a href=""#R55"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R55"">Mills et al., 2014</a>; <a href=""#R85"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R85"">Whitaker et al., 2016</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P37"">Within the default mode network, previous work has examined functional connectivity in patients who were at high and low risk for developing depressive and anxiety disorders and observed that children who are at high risk (based on the presence of behavioral inhibition) have decreased default mode network connectivity, although salience network connectivity did not differ between the two groups (<a href=""#R29"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R29"">Bellgowan et al., 2015</a>). Taken together with the current findings, these results raise the possibility that structural and functional abnormalities within these networks may be related. Additionally, the two regions within the ventral and dorsal attention networks (bilateral interior and superior parietal cortex) differed between those patients with and without high levels of depressive symptoms. Within this network, resting state functional connectivity differs between those youth 8-12 years of age with a history of anxiety or depressive disorders and healthy, age-matched youth (<a href=""#R77"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R77"">Sylvester et al., 2013</a>). Further, these networks may already exhibit distinct connectivity patterns in infants who are at risk for developing depressive disorders (<a href=""#R79"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R79"">Sylvester et al., 2018</a>)—which typically precede the development of anxiety disorders (<a href=""#R3"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R3"">Asselmann et al., 2014</a>; <a href=""#R62"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R62"">Pine et al., 1998</a>) suggesting the neurobiological underpinnings of anxiety and depressive disorders may far precede clinical manifestations of illness. Although functional connectivity analyses are beyond the scope of the present study, processing of fMRI data in this sample before and during treatment as part of a larger randomized control trial is ongoing (<a href=""http://clinicaltrials.gov"" class=""usa-link"" data-ga-action=""click_feat_suppl"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">clinicaltrials.gov</a>, <a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02818751"" class=""usa-link"" data-ga-action=""click_feat_suppl"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">NCT02818751</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P38"">Finally, in our <em>post-hoc</em> examination of cortical thickness-age relationships, anxious adolescents with more depressive symptoms had thicker cortices than expected for their age in many of the same structures within with salience, default mode, and ventral attention networks. During adolescence, these regions typically undergo pruning (<a href=""#R12"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R12"">Blakemore, 2008</a>; <a href=""#R13"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R13"">Blakemore et al., 2006</a>) although environmental factors can alter network connectivity in these regions during childhood and early adolescence (<a href=""#R65"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R65"">Rebello et al., 2018</a>). Importantly, neurostructural changes (<em>e.g.</em>, changes in cortical thickness, synaptic pruning, and myelination) impact network dynamics (<a href=""#R35"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R35"">He et al., 2007</a>; <a href=""#R76"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R76"">Sur et al., 2005</a>) and likewise network dynamics can modify the physical structure of a network (<a href=""#R42"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R42"">Katz et al., 1996</a>; <a href=""#R49"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R49"">Majewska et al., 2006</a>). The aberrancies in cortical thickness-age relationship that we observed could suggest delayed cortical maturation (<em>ie</em>, slowed cortical migration or pruning) in anxious adolescents who develop more severe depressive symptoms. This delay in cortical maturation could then disrupt network connectivity and pathogenically contribute to depressive symptoms in anxious adolescents.</p>"
"<p id=""P39"">The present article has important limitations. First, our data are observational and cross-sectional. We cannot comment on the time course of the development of these depressive symptoms or predict in which patients these depressive symptoms will indeed later present as full MDD. Second, our sample size is relatively small, which increases the risk of Type II error. Third, whether these individuals go on to develop MDD or continue to experience persistent levels of depressive symptoms remains to be determined. Fourth, the primary rating scales used in this study (<em>ie</em>, CDRS-R and PARS) were developed to characterize symptoms as they relate to depressive and anxiety disorders, respectively. Network clustering of one scale’s items with other items on the same scale could be due to biased terminology used in the rating scale rather than unbiased appraisal of a given symptom. For example, the CDRS-R defines severely “impaired schoolwork” as “no motivation to perform” which implies impaired schoolwork is related to an amotivational state rather than avoidance or poor concentration due to anxiety (<a href=""#R51"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R51"">Mayes et al., 2010</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P40"">While these cross-sectional analyses cannot causally link anxiety and depressive symptoms nor can they establish that anxiety-cluster symptoms predate depression-cluster symptoms, our findings are consistent with several lines of evidence concerning the relationship between anxiety and depression. First, anxiety disorders typically precede depressive disorders in youth (<a href=""#R5"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R5"">Beesdo et al., 2007</a>; <a href=""#R11"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R11"">Bittner et al., 2004</a>). Second, our patients’ primary diagnosis of GAD, rather than MDD, makes these bridge symptoms areas of interest for further, longitudinal studies in the pathogenesis of MDD in anxious adolescents. Third, the clustering of classically depression-related symptoms (<em>e.g.</em>, social withdrawal, poor sleep, and fatigue) within our anxious cluster underscores their poor specificity for depression; they may not constitute true “bridge” symptoms. Further, these three symptoms do not directly correlate with either core depression symptom (<em>i.e.</em>, anhedonia and depressed mood) in our association network. Therefore, in the case of youth with anxiety disorders, these three symptoms can arise solely due to the anxiety disorder and should not be seen as evidence of an emerging depressive disorder.</p>"
"<p id=""P41"">Anxiety and depressive symptoms form distinct clusters in adolescents with primary anxiety disorders who do not meet criteria for MDD. These clusters mirror groupings in common assessment instruments (<em>i.e.</em>, CDRS-R and PARS) for youth with anxiety or depression; however, some key symptoms (<em>e.g.</em>, excessive weeping, low self-esteem, impaired schoolwork, appetite disturbances, physical symptoms) fail to cluster within either the anxiety or depressive cluster and form correlative links between anxious and depressive clusters. These “bridge” symptoms may be important in the pathogenesis of depressive disorders in anxious youth. Further, adolescents with GAD and high depressive symptom burden show specific changes in default mode and central executive networks which may serve as a neurostructural fingerprint in anxious youth with early depressive symptoms. Moreover, these same youth have reduced age-cortical thickness correlations relative to anxious youth with low depressive symptom burden suggesting the emergence of depressive symptoms in early GAD and cortical development may have bidirectional, neurobiological relationships. Finally, longitudinal studies are needed to explore the development of depression in anxious youth.</p>"

"<p>Abundant evidence suggests that inflammatory cytokines contribute to the symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD) by altering neurotransmission, neuroplasticity, and neuroendocrine processes. Given the unsatisfactory response and remission of monoaminergic antidepressants, anti-inflammatory therapy is proposed as a feasible way to augment the antidepressant effect. Recently, there have been emerging studies investigating the efficiency and efficacy of anti-inflammatory agents in the treatment of MDD and depressive symptoms comorbid with somatic diseases.</p>"
"<p>In this narrative review, prospective clinical trials focusing on anti-inflammatory treatment for depression have been comprehensively searched and screened. Based on the included studies, we summarize the rationale for the anti-inflammatory therapy of depression and discuss the utilities and confusions regarding the anti-inflammatory strategy for MDD.</p>"
"<p>This review included over 45 eligible trials. For ease of discussion, we have grouped them into six categories based on their mechanism of action, and added some other anti-inflammatory modalities, including Chinese herbal medicine and non-drug therapy. Pooled results suggest that anti-inflammatory therapy is effective in improving depressive symptoms, whether used as monotherapy or add-on therapy. However, there remain confusions in the application of anti-inflammatory therapy for MDD.</p>"
"<p>Based on current clinical evidence, anti-inflammatory therapy is a promisingly effective treatment for depression. This study proposes a novel strategy for clinical diagnosis, disease classification, personalized treatment, and prognostic prediction of depression. Inflammatory biomarkers are recommended to be assessed at the first admission of MDD patients, and anti-inflammatory therapy are recommended to be included in the clinical practice guidelines for diagnosis and treatment. Those patients with high levels of baseline inflammation (<em>e.g</em>., CRP &gt; 3 mg/L) may benefit from adjunctive anti-inflammatory therapy.</p>"

"<p>Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most prevalent and debilitating diseases in the world. According to estimates by the World Health Organization (WHO), about 280 million people are suffering from this disease, accounting for about 3.8% of the world's total population. The incidence of this disease spreads across all ages, among which the prevalence of depression in adults is about 5%, and the prevalence in people over 60 years old is as high as 5.7% [<a href=""#r1"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r1"">1</a>]. As MDD often severely limits the psychosocial functioning of patients, reduces their quality of life, and increases economic burden, it is also listed as an important contributor to the global disease burden. In 2018, depressive disorders were reported to be the third leading cause of years lived with disability after low back pain and headache disorders [<a href=""#r2"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r2"">2</a>, <a href=""#r3"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r3"">3</a>]. Especially since the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the incidence of MDD has climbed further. It is reported that the epidemic has increased the prevalence of depression by about 53 million in 2020, an increase of about 27.6%. When we quantified the disease burden using disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), which represent the number of years of healthy life lost due to death or disability, the pandemic was estimated to increase depression-induced DALYs by 137.1/100,000, mainly in females [<a href=""#r4"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r4"">4</a>]. Therefore, MDD has become an important public health problem that disturbs the global healthcare system, and has attracted worldwide attention.</p>"
"<p>To date, the treatment of MDD mainly includes three approaches: (1) pharmacotherapy, primarily the application of antidepressants and other adjuvant drugs that enhance the effect of antidepressants; (2) psychotherapy, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) and interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT), and (3) non-drug physical therapy, including electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), and vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) [<a href=""#r5"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r5"">5</a>-<a href=""#r7"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r7"">7</a>]. Among them, antidepressant therapy remains the most preferred method, especially for patients with moderate to severe symptoms. In this regard, as early as 1965, Schildkraut <em>et al</em>. proposed the “catecholamine hypothesis of affective disorders” based on previous findings that depressive symptoms can be unexpectedly improved by monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) or imipramine-like agents [<a href=""#r8"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r8"">8</a>]. Since then, most of the research and development of antidepressant drugs has focused on maintaining the concentration of the monoamine neurotransmitter and regulating its function. At present, various guidelines for the management of MDD consistently recommend selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and some other antidepressants as first-line drug options [<a href=""#r9"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r9"">9</a>]. Generally, most cases of MDD can achieve remission after standardized treatment, while some cases will recur. According to reports, about one-third of patients achieved clinical remission after their first-round antidepressant treatment, and even after 4 different antidepressants were administered sequentially for 12 weeks each time within a year, only two-thirds of patients achieved clinical remission [<a href=""#r10"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r10"">10</a>, <a href=""#r11"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r11"">11</a>]. This leaves a large group of patients with insufficient or no response to currently recommended therapeutic interventions. In addition to the unsatisfactory response and remission, these monoamine-modulating antidepressants also have delayed onset, high recurrence rate, and drug-related side effects, like nausea and sexual dysfunction [<a href=""#r9"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r9"">9</a>, <a href=""#r12"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r12"">12</a>]. Up to 63% of patients taking second-generation antidepressants experience adverse events, while 7% to 15% of patients discontinue treatment due to adverse events [<a href=""#r13"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r13"">13</a>]. Hence, there is a desire to find an ideal antidepressant with faster action, better toleration, higher efficacy and efficiency, and fewer side effects. Also, there is a strong unmet need for additional treatment options.</p>"
"<p>To some extent, the appearance of these clinical phenomena may be attributed to the unclear pathophysiological mechanisms of depression. Despite considerable advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology of MDD in recent years, no single model or hypothesis can perfectly explain all aspects of the disorder. On the one hand, different causes or pathophysiological processes may lead to episodes in different patients; on the other hand, even if the same patient has different episodes at different times, the pathogenesis can also be different. Specifically, the most convincing mechanistic hypotheses at present include stress-related disequilibrium, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction, monoaminergic neurotransmitter disturbance, pro-inflammatory-anti-inflammatory imbalance, neurotrophic factor deficiency, pathological neurodegeneration, gut microbiota dysbiosis, <em>etc</em>. [<a href=""#r9"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r9"">9</a>, <a href=""#r14"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r14"">14</a>-<a href=""#r16"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r16"">16</a>]. Of these, psychosocial and biological stress seems to be a key origin of MDD [<a href=""#r17"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r17"">17</a>, <a href=""#r18"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r18"">18</a>]. It is associated with almost every mediator underlying the pathophysiology of MDD, including genetic predisposition, history of adverse early life events, HPA axis hyperactivity, decreased monoamines and brain-derived neurotrophic factor, increased proinflammatory cytokines, and even epigenetic alterations [<a href=""#r19"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r19"">19</a>]. Recently, abundant studies have reported that depressive symptoms and severity are closely related to cytokine levels, and anti-inflammatory drugs are expected to be a promising direction for drug development other than traditional monoamine-regulating antidepressants [<a href=""#r20"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r20"">20</a>, <a href=""#r21"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r21"">21</a>].</p>"
"<p>In fact, several clinical trials have explored the antidepressant effects of both pharmacological and nonpharmacological therapies aimed at harnessing immune overactivation. However, the methods and results of these studies vary widely: some subjects were inpatients or outpatients diagnosed with MDD, while others were medical patients with depressive symptoms or complaints; some used anti-inflammatory drugs monotherapy, while some applied anti-inflammatory therapy as adjuvants added to treatment as usual; some carried out short-course therapy for a few days, while some performed long-term therapy across years; and tools used to evaluate improvement in depressive symptoms were also substantially different. As such, the main purpose of the current narrative review was to comprehensively assess the literature on the impact of anti-inflammatory treatments on clinical outcomes in patients with MDD, as well as on the effect of these approaches on the severity of depressive symptoms in individuals with somatic disorders. Based on the collected evidence, we have analyzed and discussed the diagnosis and treatment protocols for MDD, and proposed a novel anti-inflammatory strategy, hoping to propose an anti-inflammatory method for diagnosing and treating MDD more reasonably and efficiently.</p>"
"<p>As aforementioned, the monoamine hypothesis has dominated the pathogenesis of MDD in the past half-century. The catecholamine [<a href=""#r8"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r8"">8</a>] and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT or serotonin) [<a href=""#r22"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r22"">22</a>] hypotheses were proposed almost simultaneously in the 1960s. Although the rationale for these hypotheses arose not from pathophysiological explorations of disease but from unexpected pharmacological observations, it does make a great contribution to the treatment of MDD [<a href=""#r23"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r23"">23</a>]. However, people have gradually realized that antidepressants designed to modulate monoamine transmitters were unable to meet the practical needs for a complete remission of major depression. Thereupon, human beings try hard to find another way out on this track. Interestingly, the discovery of the linkage between depression and inflammation (cytokines) also arose from unexpected clinical observations [<a href=""#r24"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r24"">24</a>]. This section will mainly introduce the origin and development of antidepressants, as well as the theoretical background of anti-inflammatory treatment for MDD.</p>"
"<p>Antidepressants have been around for hundreds of years. For example, owing to its sweet smell, people smell frankincense to improve the gloomy mood, so it has been used as an “ancient antidepressant” in “aromatherapy” for a period of time [<a href=""#r25"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r25"">25</a>]. Another botanical candidate is St. John's wort, which was officially listed as an antidepressant in Germany in 1984. In traditional Chinese medicine, it is also known as <em>Hypericum perforatum</em> L., and is the main antidepressant medicinal component in Shugan Jieyu Capsule, a proprietary Chinese medicine approved by the State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) for the treatment of mild to moderate depression [<a href=""#r26"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r26"">26</a>, <a href=""#r27"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r27"">27</a>]. Besides, some psychoactive substances have been suggested as the “solution” to anhedonia. For example, before the formula change in 1904, cocaine was an early ingredient in Coca-Cola, which led to the popularity of this drink in the United States (US) for its effect on inducing excitement and hallucinations. Likewise, benzedrine (amphetamine) and opioids were also marketed in the 1930s and preferred to treat depression [<a href=""#r28"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r28"">28</a>].</p>"
"<p>In the 1950s, reserpine was successfully extracted from <em>Rauwolfia serpentina</em> (Indian snakeroot) [<a href=""#r29"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r29"">29</a>]. It was then fully synthesized industrially and brought to the market as an efficient antihypertensive drug [<a href=""#r30"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r30"">30</a>]. However, doctors soon discovered that reserpine could lead to depression-like symptoms and even severe suicidal ideation. The reason is mainly the mechanism of selectively inhibiting the vesicular monoamine transporter in the intracellular environment, making it difficult for free monoamines (serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine) to be transported into the vesicles of the presynaptic nerve terminals in a reuptake manner. As a result, these monoamine neurotransmitters are gradually degraded by the enzymes, monoamine oxidase (MAO) and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), in the cytoplasm [<a href=""#r28"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r28"">28</a>, <a href=""#r31"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r31"">31</a>]. Likewise, iproniazid (isoniazid with a propyl group attached) was also reported to improve mood and appetite possibly by inhibiting MAO and increasing neuronal levels of monoamine [<a href=""#r32"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r32"">32</a>]. Coincidentally, Swiss psychiatrist Roland Kuhn examined the antidepressant efficacy of the chlorpromazine derivative “imipramine” [<a href=""#r33"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r33"">33</a>]. Later, in the 1960s, Julius Axelrod, who won a Nobel Prize in 1970, demonstrated that reserpine, amphetamine, imipramine, and chlorpromazine markedly inhibited the reuptake of norepinephrine in cats [<a href=""#r34"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r34"">34</a>]. Moreover, iproniazid and imipramine were successively approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for MDD in the US, thus establishing the mechanistic basis of current antidepressant medications.</p>"
"<p>With the discovery of their antidepressant effects, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), such as imipramine and amitriptyline, quickly became the most widely used drugs for MDD, especially those of severe melancholic subtypes. There are also some TCA-associated tetracyclic antidepressants (TeCAs), like amoxapine, maprotiline, mianserin, and mirtazapine [<a href=""#r35"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r35"">35</a>]. However, most of these drugs and the once popular MAOIs are not well-tolerated due to their adverse impacts, such as anticholinergic and membrane stabilizing (quinidine-like) effects, and the lethality in overdose [<a href=""#r36"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r36"">36</a>]. Thereby, modern drugs have been developed to be more selective inhibitors of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. For example, bupropion was the first member of norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors (NDRIs). As the first-line and most prescribed antidepressant category, SSRIs primarily include fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, citalopram, and escitalopram. Following the SSRIs, venlafaxine and duloxetine are categorized as SNRIs. Clinical guidelines usually recommend the use of SNRIs for patients who do not respond to SSRIs [<a href=""#r37"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r37"">37</a>, <a href=""#r38"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r38"">38</a>]. Other common antidepressants have also been developed that could both block serotonin reuptake and modulate specific serotonin receptor subtypes [<a href=""#r39"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r39"">39</a>].</p>"
"<p>More recently, some antidepressants focusing on other targets have been invented. For instance, mirtazapine exerts its antidepressant effect <em>via</em> antagonizing central alpha 2-adrenergic receptors and the 5-HT-2 and 5-HT-3 serotonergic receptors. Because mirtazapine has a limited effect on monoamine reuptake, it was classified as a member of noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressants (NaSSAs) [<a href=""#r40"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r40"">40</a>]. Agomelatine is a novel antidepressant claimed to act through a combination of agonist activity at MT1/MT2 melatonergic receptors and antagonist activity at 5-HT-2C serotonergic receptors [<a href=""#r41"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r41"">41</a>, <a href=""#r42"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r42"">42</a>]. In 2000, Berman <em>et al.</em> [<a href=""#r43"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r43"">43</a>] first reported that the infusion of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist ketamine could rapidly improve depressive symptoms in MDD patients at a relatively low dose within 3 days. Since then, this old anesthetic has expanded into a brand-new field of application. So far, intranasal S-ketamine therapy has been approved by the FDA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) as a legitimate treatment option for MDD, especially treatment-resistant depression (TRD) [<a href=""#r44"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r44"">44</a>].</p>"
"<p>Although an iconic systematic review and network meta-analysis paper that included 21 commonly used antidepressants has concluded that all the candidate drugs were significantly more efficacious than placebo in adults with MDD [<a href=""#r23"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r23"">23</a>], it is undeniable that their effects are still unsatisfying. As the remarkable sequenced treatment alternatives to relieve depression (STAR*D) study calculated, the cumulative remission rate after four standard steps was still approximately only 67% [<a href=""#r5"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r5"">5</a>, <a href=""#r11"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r11"">11</a>]. Even with optimism, this statistic may not boost much at present. Combined with the delayed clinical onsets and neurochemical adverse effects of most current antidepressants, a purely neurotransmitter-based regimen is challenged.</p>"
"<p>As also evident in the history, it is very common in medical research that accidental discoveries have provided critical clues. In the late 1980s, McDonald <em>et al.</em> [<a href=""#r45"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r45"">45</a>] carried out a clinical trial administering interferon-α (IFN-α) to 43 hepatitis B patients for 3-6 months. This far-reaching study showed that participants who received IFN-α had a significant increase in psychiatric symptoms, some severe enough to require urgent psychiatric treatment, compared to a matched control group. These patients often complained of fatigue, loss of interest, poor concentration, low mood, and anxiety. Subsequently, a smaller but more purposeful clinical study reported similar emotional changes in IFN-treated patients. Niiranen <em>et al.</em> [<a href=""#r46"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r46"">46</a>] assessed behavioral and subjectively experienced changes in 9 patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) treated with IFN-α infusions. Although the recruited patients were confirmed mentally healthy before the trial, after 6 days of IFN-α treatment, all patients complained of depression-like symptoms, including moderate to severe fatigue, lack of interest, slowed thinking, loss of appetite, anorexia, confusion, or inability to concentrate. Besides, 7 of the 9 became irritable, and 5 experienced severe depressed mood. By integrating these clinical clues, the cytokine hypothesis of depression was first proposed by Smith [<a href=""#r20"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r20"">20</a>] in the form of the “macrophage theory of depression,” and further demonstrated and elucidated by Maes <em>et al.</em> [<a href=""#r47"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r47"">47</a>] in the early 1990s [<a href=""#r24"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r24"">24</a>, <a href=""#r48"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r48"">48</a>].</p>"
"<p>Cytokines are soluble proteins with a wide range of biological activities. They are mainly secreted by immune cells, like monocytes, macrophages, lymphocytes, microglia, and astrocytes, as well as by non-immune cells, like endothelium, epidermis, and fibroblasts [<a href=""#r49"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r49"">49</a>]. In short, they play a pivotal double-edged role in maintaining innate and acquired immune defense responses against pathogens and tumors, as well as regulating the homeostasis of harm and self-repair. According to the different biological functions of inflammation-related cytokines, they can be roughly divided into two categories: pro-inflammatory cytokines and anti-inflammatory cytokines. As the name suggests, they are involved in promoting or restricting inflammation, respectively [<a href=""#r50"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r50"">50</a>]. For example, interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and IFNs are some of the well-studied pro-inflammatory cytokines (also known as inflammatory cytokines or inflammatory factors), while interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) are common anti-inflammatory cytokines [<a href=""#r51"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r51"">51</a>].</p>"
"<p>In the past 30 years since the cytokine hypothesis of depression has been proposed, mounting evidence has confirmed the pathophysiological mechanisms of depression to be closely associated with the inflammatory imbalance and cytokine secretion. Conclusively, the association between inflammation and major depression mainly includes the following aspects [<a href=""#r52"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r52"">52</a>]: (1) Patients with MDD often have abnormal levels of pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory cytokines [<a href=""#r53"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r53"">53</a>, <a href=""#r54"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r54"">54</a>]. In 2010, a meta-analysis recruited 24 studies involving unstimulated measurements of cytokines in patients meeting the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-4 (DSM-4) for MDD and reported significantly higher levels of the proinflammatory TNF-α and IL-6 in depressed individuals than matched controls [<a href=""#r55"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r55"">55</a>]. Similarly, more recent meta-analyses have also concluded that, in addition to TNF-α and IL-6, peripheral levels of IL-18, IL-10, the IL-1 receptor antagonist, the soluble IL-2 receptor, C-C chemokine ligand 2, IL-13, IL-12, and the soluble TNF receptor 2 [<a href=""#r56"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r56"">56</a>], as well as IL-6 and TNF-alpha levels in CSF and brain parenchyma [<a href=""#r57"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r57"">57</a>] are elevated in patients with MDD compared to healthy controls. (2) Inflammation-related diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis [<a href=""#r58"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r58"">58</a>], inflammatory bowel disease [<a href=""#r59"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r59"">59</a>], psoriasis [<a href=""#r60"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r60"">60</a>], systemic lupus erythematosus [<a href=""#r61"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r61"">61</a>], coronary artery disease [<a href=""#r62"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r62"">62</a>], and cancer [<a href=""#r63"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r63"">63</a>], are often co-morbid with depression [<a href=""#r64"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r64"">64</a>]. (3) Administration of exogenous pro-inflammatory cytokines, like IFN-α [<a href=""#r65"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r65"">65</a>], or experimental endotoxemia induced by lipopolysaccharide injection [<a href=""#r66"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r66"">66</a>], result in sickness behavior or mood impairment in humans. (4) Antidepressants and other effective treatments for MDD can reduce the level of inflammatory cytokines in patients with major depression to a certain extent [<a href=""#r67"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r67"">67</a>]. Several drugs that modulate serotonergic signaling, including SSRIs and SNRIs, have also been shown to affect peripheral immunity [<a href=""#r68"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r68"">68</a>-<a href=""#r70"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r70"">70</a>]. Furthermore, depressive patients unresponsive to SSRIs have been reported to have higher peripheral IL-6 and TNF-α concentrations compared to normal controls and patients previously resistant to SSRIs [<a href=""#r71"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r71"">71</a>]. Likewise, a poor outcome following psychological therapy is associated with elevated IL-6, soluble intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM1), and TNF-α levels, and attenuated IFN-γ level [<a href=""#r72"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r72"">72</a>]. (5) The level of peripheral inflammatory factors is related to the severity and prognosis of depression [<a href=""#r73"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r73"">73</a>-<a href=""#r75"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r75"">75</a>]. Moreover, inflammation has been reported to be highly associated with suicidal ideation and suicidal attempts, both in depressed and non-depressed populations [<a href=""#r76"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r76"">76</a>-<a href=""#r78"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r78"">78</a>]. It has also been speculated that cytokines take part in the biomechanism of suicide possibly <em>via</em> interfering with monoamine metabolism and related pathways [<a href=""#r79"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r79"">79</a>].</p>"
"<p>As illustrated above, most clinical evidence for the relationship between major depression and inflammatory cytokines (suggestive of chronic low-grade inflammation) has been obtained in peripheral samples. However, in the traditional view, major depression is more of a disorder related to the dysfunction of the central nervous system (CNS) and less of an infection-associated disorder. That is to say, the “real” facilitator of MDD may be a sterile systemic inflammatory response [<a href=""#r80"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r80"">80</a>]. So the questions are, where does this particular type of inflammation come from, and how do central and peripheral cytokines interact?</p>"
"<p>In general, the peripheral and central innate immune system can be activated by signaling molecules derived from exogenous or endogenous factors, which are also known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), respectively [<a href=""#r81"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r81"">81</a>]. Although pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) on the surface of immune cells can recognize both PAMPs and DAMPs, the ways in which they elicit immune responses vary widely: (1) PAMP-PRR signaling typically functions upon exposure to foreign microbes or viruses, whereas (2) innate immune activation triggered by DAMP-PRR signaling usually occurs in the absence of exogenous pathogens or other sources of infection [<a href=""#r80"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r80"">80</a>]. Unfortunately, the type, release, and regulatory mechanism of these DAMPs that trigger sterile inflammation have not been fully elucidated. Nevertheless, it is suggested that their release is mostly related to neuroendocrine and homeostatic changes induced by physical and psychological stress, which is one of the most important causes of MDD [<a href=""#r80"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r80"">80</a>].</p>"
"<p>Under stressful situations, the HPA axis is activated, which subsequently stimulates the adrenal glands to synthesize and secrete cortisol into the blood, thereby leading to a systemic increase in peripheral and central cortisol levels. When the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in the hippocampus detects elevated cortisol levels, it modulates the hypothalamus through negative feedback to lower corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) [<a href=""#r82"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r82"">82</a>]. Although still controversial, emerging evidence supports elevated peripheral cortisol levels and reduced GR sensitivity in many subgroups of patients with MDD [<a href=""#r82"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r82"">82</a>-<a href=""#r85"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r85"">85</a>]. HPA axis dysregulation seems to be a vulnerability factor for MDD [<a href=""#r86"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r86"">86</a>]. In addition, stress-induced activation of the sympathetic nervous system acts systematically in multiple organs, causing neuroendocrine and immune responses [<a href=""#r18"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r18"">18</a>, <a href=""#r87"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r87"">87</a>]. In humans, there is clinical evidence that various types of psychosocial stressors may disrupt the balance of cytokine networks, including increasing pro-inflammatory IL-6, TNF-α, and IFN levels, and decreasing anti-inflammatory IL-10 level [<a href=""#r88"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r88"">88</a>-<a href=""#r90"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r90"">90</a>]. Given the complex effects of stress on the human body, experimental animals are widely used to mimic stress responses for further investigation. Studies have shown that different types of stressors could increase the pro-inflammatory cytokines (including IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α) in the circulation and CNS, and enhance the production and secretion of DAMPs, like high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1), S100b proteins, heat shock proteins (HSP), <em>etc</em>. [<a href=""#r80"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r80"">80</a>, <a href=""#r91"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r91"">91</a>] Typical pathophysiological mechanisms may include activating transcriptional factors, like nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), enhancing cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and prostaglandin production, and facilitating cell death (apoptosis/necroptosis/pyroptosis) [<a href=""#r92"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r92"">92</a>-<a href=""#r94"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r94"">94</a>].</p>"
"<p>The brain was once considered to be protected from pathogens and immune cells because of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). This feature of “immune privilege” was originally understood to be the result of the organ's lack of any lymphatic drainage [<a href=""#r95"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r95"">95</a>], which has now been revised. To the best of our knowledge, there are two main pathways for the origin and development of neuroinflammation. First, it may be associated with peripheral inflammation. Although cytokines are relatively large proteins, they can cross the BBB in a leaking way through circumventricular organs [<a href=""#r96"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r96"">96</a>]. Stress and the increased C-reaction proteins (CRPs) can also enhance the permeability of the BBB, allowing further entry of cytokines and CRPs into the brain [<a href=""#r97"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r97"">97</a>]. Second, another penetration mechanism has also been demonstrated, namely through specific saturable BBB transporters [<a href=""#r98"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r98"">98</a>, <a href=""#r99"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r99"">99</a>]. Besides, cytokine signaling can be transmitted to the brain by activating cytokine receptors on afferent nerve fibers [<a href=""#r100"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r100"">100</a>]. Also, the endothelial cells of the BBB can secrete cytokines [<a href=""#r101"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r101"">101</a>]. In addition to its peripheral origin, the CNS also has its own “local immune system”. Microglia, which share common progenitor cells with peripheral macrophages, are resident immune cells in the brain that produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, nitric oxides, and reactive oxygen species [<a href=""#r102"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r102"">102</a>]. Moreover, when microglia are activated in response to increased peripheral inflammation, they can produce chemokines that attract monocytes to the brain [<a href=""#r103"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r103"">103</a>], and further produce pro-inflammatory cytokines [<a href=""#r104"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r104"">104</a>]. On one hand, the increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines leads to GR resistance by disturbing GR function, causing the hyperactivation of the HPA axis [<a href=""#r49"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r49"">49</a>], while on the other hand, the increased pro-inflammatory cytokines may have implications for brain structure and function, possibly by increasing neurotoxic metabolites through the kynurenine pathway or by exerting neurotoxic effects directly on specific brain regions. Recently, a meta-analysis review of positron emission tomography (PET) neuroimaging studies examining the 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO) suggested the presence of TSPO upregulation in MDD, especially in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampal formation and insula [<a href=""#r105"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r105"">105</a>]. This result indicates a change in the phenotype and functional state of microglia in patients with MDD.</p>"
"<p>In order to retrieve research data for prospective clinical trials of anti-inflammatory treatments for MDD, we searched PubMed for studies published from 1966/01 to 2022/08/31. Briefly, the search consisted of two main components: (1) anti-inflammatory treatments and (2) depression. By referring to previous reviews, “anti-inflammatory treatments” was searched as the following medical subject heading when possible or free text words with slight modifications [<a href=""#r106"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r106"">106</a>]: anti-inflammatory, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory, NSAID, cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor, COX-2, celecoxib, acetaminophen, acetylsalicylic acid, cytokine inhibitors, antibodies monoclonal, infliximab, etanercept, antibiotics, minocycline, statin, corticosteroid, glucocorticoid, peroxisome proliferators-activated receptors agonist, PPAR agonist, immunomodulator, or immunosuppressor. Simultaneously, “depression” was searched as major depressive disorder, depression, or depressive symptoms. The search results of the two parts were combined using the “AND” operator, and then automatically screened by applying the filter function for the clinical trial. It should be noted that the current paper is a comprehensive narrative review in which the included studies are reorganized by drug types, rather than a systematic review exhaustively reviewing the literature or a meta-analysis integrating results and quantifying the effect size. Data were impartially compiled and overviewed as systematically as possible. The results are described below.

"<p>As a canonical pro-inflammatory cytokine, TNF-α plays a protective role against infection and injury in normal immune responses. Upon binding to TNF receptors (TNFR1/ TNFR2), TNF-α mediates apoptosis and inflammatory cascades by activating NF-κB, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, and death signaling. There are three common types of TNF-α antibodies approved for clinical use: (1) anti-TNF-α IgG1 antibodies (infliximab/Remicade, adalimumab/Humira, and golimumab/Simponi), (2) pegylated antibody fragment (certolizumab pegol/Cimzia), and (3) antibody-like Fc-fusion protein (etanercept/Enbrel) [<a href=""#r107"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r107"">107</a>].</p>"
"<p>Adalimumab is the first fully recombinant human subcutaneously administered anti-TNF monoclonal (mAb) antibody that is structurally and functionally indistinguishable from naturally occurring human immunoglobulin 1 (IgG1) [<a href=""#r108"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r108"">108</a>]. It specifically binds to TNF-α and blocks interactions with p55 and p75 cell surface TNFRs [<a href=""#r109"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r109"">109</a>]. The study by Loftus <em>et al.</em> [<a href=""#r110"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r110"">110</a>] included patients diagnosed with moderate to severe Crohn’s disease for at least 4 months prior to the beginning of the study. At the baseline visit (week 0), all patients received open-label adalimumab 80-mg subcutaneous injection, followed by a 40-mg dose at week 2 (induction therapy). At week 4, a total of 778 patients identified as “responders” were randomized to three groups: adalimumab 40 mg every other week (eow), adalimumab 40 mg weekly, or placebo injections (“induction-only” group). In addition to other health-related quality of life (HRQOL) measurements, 499 randomized responders (with a reduction of at least 70 points from baseline in the Crohn’s Disease Activity Index [CDAI]) were evaluated and analyzed with the Zung Depression Scale (ZDS) at baseline and weeks 4, 12, 26, and 56. Compared to the placebo group, patients in the adalimumab EOW maintenance group reported less ZDS scores at all time blocks after week 4, while patients who continued weekly injections exhibited less depression only at week 56. There were no significant differences in ZDS scores between the adalimumab EOW and weekly arms for all visits. However, a possible bias could be that the analyses were primarily based on “responders” to induction therapy. Menter <em>et al.</em> [<a href=""#r111"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r111"">111</a>] investigated the effects of adalimumab on depression symptoms in anti-TNF therapy-naïve patients with moderate to severe psoriasis (body surface area ≥ 5%) that could not be controlled by topical therapy. A total of 96 included patients were randomly assigned to double-blind treatment with placebo or adalimumab 40 mg weekly, or EOW treatment starting at week 1 after the 80 mg dose at baseline. But, in this study, the authors only analyzed the ZDS scores in the 40-mg EOW and placebo groups at baseline and week 12 or early termination (ET). Compared to the placebo group, the ZDS score in the EOW group reduced more by week 12/ET.</p>"
"<p>Infliximab is the first chimeric mAb (mouse/human) designed to block and neutralize TNF-α [<a href=""#r112"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r112"">112</a>]. Although not the first to try, Raison and collaborators [<a href=""#r113"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r113"">113</a>] published the first paper to examine TNF-α-inhibitory therapy for MDD in antidepressant nonresponders. In this trial, 60 MDD patients who were either receiving a consistent antidepressant regimen or medication free for 4 weeks were included and randomized to a treatment group with 3 infusions of 5 mg/kg infliximab or placebo. Group assignment was stratified by sex and baseline inflammation as determined by high-sensitive CRP (hs-CRP) levels. Assessments of the 17-item Hamilton Scale for Depression (HDRS) and inflammatory status (hs-CRP and TNF, as well as its soluble receptors I and II) were conducted at baseline and weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12. Like previous traditional trials for antidepressants, the primary outcome of this study was a change in HDRS scores, while additional outcomes included treatment response (50% or more reduction in HDRS score at any time) and remission (HDRS score ≤ 7 at the end of treatment). At first glance, infliximab did not show overall superiority to placebo on the primary outcome. However, the subsequent analysis demonstrated a significant interaction between treatment, time, and log baseline hs-CRP level. For patients with higher baseline inflammation (hs-CRP &gt; 5 mg/L), treatment with infliximab resulted in greater HDRS reduction and better response (not statistically significant) than placebo, while placebo outperformed infliximab in patients with lower baseline inflammation (hs-CRP ≤ 5 mg/L). It should be noted that this study also included participants with bipolar disorder and depression. The second analysis of this trial also showed that compared to infliximab-treated patients with hs-CRP ≤ 5 mg/L, sleep continuity of those with hs-CRP &gt; 5 mg/L significantly improved from baseline to 2 weeks after 3 infusions (week 8) [<a href=""#r114"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r114"">114</a>]. Furthermore, a recent study by Webers <em>et al.</em> [<a href=""#r115"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r115"">115</a>] evaluated the effect of infliximab on depressive symptoms in adult patients diagnosed with ankylosing spondylitis (AS). The recruited patients were randomly allocated to infliximab or placebo until week 24 (infusions of 5 mg/kg infliximab or placebo at weeks 0, 2, 6, 12, and 18), after which all received infliximab until week 54. Depressive symptoms were measured with the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale (CES-D). Finally, the results showed that after 24 weeks of treatment, the infliximab group had a greater improvement in CES-D scores than the placebo group. However, the small number of patients and the application of a screening questionnaire somewhat limited the power of this study.</p>"
"<p>Etanercept is a dimeric fusion protein that binds TNF, which competitively inhibits the binding of TNF to TNFRs on the cell surface, rendering TNF biologically inactive [<a href=""#r116"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r116"">116</a>]. Kekow and colleagues [<a href=""#r117"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r117"">117</a>] conducted a trial to compare the effect of etanercept 50 mg once weekly combined with methotrexate (MTX) <em>versus</em> MTX alone on patient-reported outcomes (PROs), including Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS), for 52 weeks. Although most PROs exhibited significantly greater improvements with etanercept plus MTX than MTX alone, the result regarding HADS was negative. Another study by Tyring <em>et al.</em> [<a href=""#r118"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r118"">118</a>] evaluated the effect of etanercept in patients diagnosed with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis with scalp involvement. The patients were randomly allocated to two groups. One group received etanercept 50 mg twice weekly (BIW) by subcutaneous injection for 12 weeks, followed by etanercept 50 mg once weekly (QW) and placebo QW for 12 weeks. The other group received placebo BIW for 12 weeks, followed by etanercept 50 mg BIW for 12 weeks. A meaningful difference in depressive symptoms, as assessed by PROs of emotional distress/depression, between etanercept and placebo, was observed at week 12.</p>"
"<p>As introduced before, another cytokine that is strongly involved in depression is IL-6. Accordingly, Sun <em>et al.</em> [<a href=""#r119"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r119"">119</a>] performed a study to examine the effect of IL-6 mAbs administration on depressive symptoms in patients with multicentric Castleman’s disease (MCD) or rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The data were obtained from two independent trials to test the efficacy of siltuximab on MCD and sirukumab on RA. Siltuximab is a chimeric anti-IL-6 antibody with murine variable and human constant regions, which inhibits the binding of IL-6 to IL-6 receptor, while sirukumab is a fully human anti-IL-6 mAb that binds to a special site of IL-6 [<a href=""#r120"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r120"">120</a>]. Results showed that both siltuximab treatment for 15 weeks and sirukumab treatment for 12 weeks significantly improved depressive symptoms compared to placebo, as assessed by the 36-item Short Health Questionnaire (SF-36).</p>"
"<p>Considering that IL-6 plays a specific role in enhancing inflammation by regulating T helper cell 17 (Th17) and IL-17 production, and that the IL-17A pathway may have potential CNS effects, Griffiths <em>et al.</em> [<a href=""#r121"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r121"">121</a>] conducted a clinical trial to determine the efficacy of anti-IL-17A mAb in treating depressive symptoms in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis. The data were integrated from 3 phase III trials. Patients were randomly assigned to receive 80 mg ixekizumab (a humanized high-affinity mAb that selectively inhibits the binding of IL-17A to IL-17 receptor A) every 4 weeks (q4w), and 80 mg ixekizumab or placebo every 2 weeks (q2w). Serum hs-CRP and 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomology - Self-Report (QIDS-SR16) were assessed at baseline and week 12. Pooled data from 2 of the 3 studies were also used for the comparison of etanercept. At week 12, patients treated with both doses of ixekizumab showed significantly greater reductions in their QIDS-SR16 total scores and higher rates of remission of depressive symptoms <em>versus</em> placebo. Moreover, patients treated with ixekizumab also had significant reductions in hsCRP. However, there was no significant difference found between the etanercept treatment group and the placebo group in terms of their changes in QIDS-SR16 total score or clinical response and remission.</p>"
"<p>As reported, IL-23 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that promotes the development of Th17 cells. Ustekinumab is a human mAb targeting the p40 subunit found in both IL-12 and IL-23 [<a href=""#r122"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r122"">122</a>]. An open-label trial validating the effect of ustekinumab on depressive symptoms in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis was performed by Kim and collaborators [<a href=""#r123"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r123"">123</a>]. In this study, 15 sex-matched healthy volunteers were recruited for comparison. Treatment with 45 mg of ustekinumab (3 injections at baseline, weeks 4 and 12; 90 mg if baseline weight ≥ 100 kg) significantly reduced depressive symptoms, as evaluated using Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and HDRS. However, the brain 18-fluorodeoxy-glucose (FDG)-PET detection showed no significant difference between the groups.</p>"
"<p>Additionally, the effect of dupilumab, a fully human mAb targeting the IL-4 receptor-α and inhibiting signaling of the Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13, on PROs, including depressive symptoms in adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, was assessed by Simpson <em>et al.</em> [<a href=""#r124"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r124"">124</a>]. Patients were randomly allocated to subcutaneous treatment with dupilumab 100 mg every 4 weeks (q4w), 300 mg q4w, 200 mg q2w, 300 mg q2w, 300 mg qw, or placebo for 16 weeks. At the 16th week, patients receiving all doses of dupilumab reported greater reductions in total HADS and depression subscale scores. Further, Cork <em>et al.</em> [<a href=""#r125"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r125"">125</a>] showed that dupilumab at 300 mg q2w and 300 mg qw doses significantly improved the depressive symptoms of patients with atopic dermatitis after 2 weeks of treatment, which lasted until the whole 16-week treatment phase, compared to placebo.</p>"
"<p>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are one of the most commonly used drugs for the treatment of pain, fever, and inflammation [<a href=""#r126"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r126"">126</a>]. Their basic mode of action is to inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, thus reducing the release of prostaglandins (PGs) and thromboxane (TxA) [<a href=""#r127"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r127"">127</a>]. Generally, COX-1 is constitutively expressed at low levels in organs, such as the gastrointestinal tract and kidney, and maintains the synthesis of physiologically important prostanoids. In contrast, the expression of COX-2 is up-regulated in immune cells by pro-inflammatory stimulants. Sustained activation of COX-2 is associated with the overproduction of inflammatory factors/mediators and pain-related PGs [<a href=""#r127"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r127"">127</a>, <a href=""#r128"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r128"">128</a>]. The classification of NSAIDs drugs is also usually based on chemical structure and COX selectivity: (1) non-selective inhibitors include acetylated salicylates (aspirin), (2) nonacetylated salicylates (diflunisal), (3) acetic acid (indomethacin, diclofenac), (4) propionic acid (ibuprofen, naproxen), (5) enolic acid (piroxicam, meloxicam), and (6) more selective COX-2 inhibitors (celecoxib, etoricoxib) [<a href=""#r129"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r129"">129</a>]. Those with highly selective inhibition of COX-2 are thought to have fewer side effects and are preferable because they not only prevent the release of excessive pro-inflammatory PGE2, but also spare the gastroprotective prostaglandin synthesis mediated by constitutive COX [<a href=""#r127"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r127"">127</a>].</p>"
"<p>There are many clinical trials using COX-2 selective inhibitors to treat depression. According to a clinical trial conducted by Muller <em>et al.</em> [<a href=""#r130"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r130"">130</a>], in patients suffering from an acute depressive episode, 6 weeks of combined treatment with celecoxib (400 mg/day) and reboxetine resulted in a more significant improvement in HDRS scores compared to reboxetine plus placebo. Another study by Akhondzadeh <em>et al.</em> [<a href=""#r131"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r131"">131</a>] included 40 adult outpatients diagnosed with MDD by DSM-IV criteria (HDRS score ≥ 18). The celecoxib group received fluoxetine 40 mg/day plus celecoxib 400 mg/day (200 mg bid) while the placebo group received matched fluoxetine plus placebo. Evaluations were performed using HDRS at baseline and 1, 2, 4, and 6 weeks after the active phase of the study. Although HDRS scores in both groups decreased over the trial period, the combination of fluoxetine and celecoxib showed a significant superiority over fluoxetine plus placebo. Similarly, Abbasi <em>et al.</em> [<a href=""#r132"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r132"">132</a>] showed that the combination of 200 mg twice daily celecoxib with 200 mg/day sertraline for 6 weeks yielded a significantly greater reduction in HDRS scores and serum levels of IL-6 compared to placebo. Jafari <em>et al.</em> [<a href=""#r133"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r133"">133</a>] investigated the use of celecoxib in individuals with mild-to-moderate depression due to brucellosis and scored less than 19 on HDRS-17. The patients were separated into groups of celecoxib (200 mg bid) or placebo as an adjunctive to antibiotic therapy (600-900 mg/day rifampin added to 100 mg doxycycline twice daily) for 8 weeks. Depressive symptoms were evaluated using HDRS at baseline, week 4, and week 8. The results showed the celecoxib-combination group to have significantly lower HDRS scores since week 4, as well as a greater reduction in HDRS and a higher response from baseline to week 8 compared to the placebo-combination group. However, since the use of the antibiotic itself may alter the immune system, this study may be biased. The study by Majd <em>et al.</em> [<a href=""#r134"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r134"">134</a>] included female patients diagnosed with MDD of the first episode by DSM-IV-TR (text revision) criteria. The patients were treated with either sertraline plus celecoxib (100 mg bid) or sertraline plus placebo twice daily, and evaluated by HDRS at baseline, week 4, and week 8 of treatment. Although the celecoxib group had a greater reduction in HDRS scores and a higher response after 4 weeks compared to the placebo group, these effects did not last until the 8th week. The results suggested that celecoxib may hasten the onset of the antidepressant action of sertraline. Furthermore, Alamdarsaravi and collaborators [<a href=""#r135"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r135"">135</a>] conducted a trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of celecoxib monotherapy (200 mg bid) for depressive symptoms in colorectal cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. The recruited participants had mild to moderate depression according to the DSM-V, with an HDRS score ranging from 8 to 18. Regarding the result, improvements in HDRS scores were significantly greater in the celecoxib group by week 2 and remained higher by week 6 post-intervention. Besides, although there was no significant difference in response rates between the two groups, the celecoxib group showed a higher response rate at week 6. In another recent study, Baune <em>et al.</em> [<a href=""#r136"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r136"">136</a>] performed a clinical trial to measure the efficacy of anti-inflammatory augmentation of antidepressant treatment in MDD patients diagnosed by Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) and DSM-IV. The study was designed similarly to previous trials; participants with a Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score ≥ 20 were assigned to receive vortioxetine plus celecoxib (400 mg daily) or vortioxetine plus placebo for 6 weeks. The authors obtained negative results that celecoxib augmentation did not show superior efficacy over placebo on depressive symptom severity, response and remission rates, cognition and psychosocial functioning. There was also no evidence that pretreatment inflammation levels were associated with the effect of the celecoxib co-administration compared to placebo.</p>"
"<p>In a study aimed to determine the effect of low-dose aspirin (100 mg daily) on the risk of depression in healthy elderly adults (≥ 70 years), the results failed to support the primary hypothesis that individuals taking low-dose aspirin would have a lower prevalence of depression compared to those taking placebo. This study defined depression as a score of at least 8 on the 10-item CES-D (CES-D-10) scale [<a href=""#r137"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r137"">137</a>]. Another study by Berk <em>et al.</em> [<a href=""#r138"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r138"">138</a>] explored the antidepressant effects of NSAIDs and rosuvastatin in addition to treatment as usual in young people (aged 15-25 years) with moderate to severe MDD (MADRS score ≥ 20). Participants were assigned to receive either aspirin (100 mg daily), rosuvastatin (10 mg daily), or placebo in addition to treatment as usual. There were no significant differences found in the improvement of depression between rosuvastatin and placebo, or between aspirin and placebo. In patients aged ≤ 18 years, MADRS scores reduced more in the rosuvastatin group at week 8, and in the aspirin group at weeks 4 and 8, compared to the placebo group. Further, statins were superior to aspirin on the MADRS at week 12. Additionally, Mahagna <em>et al.</em> [<a href=""#r139"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r139"">139</a>] carried out a study to investigate the efficacy and safety of adding etoricoxib <em>vs.</em> placebo to the current therapeutic regimen of female patients with fibromyalgia. Patients were randomized to receive 90 mg once-daily etoricoxib or matched placebo for 6 weeks and were evaluated for depression by HDRS. Although being mildly underpowered, this study clearly showed that etoricoxib conferred no beneficial effects on HDRS in female patients with FMS. But owing to the adverse effects on the cardiovascular system, etoricoxib is not approved for use in several countries [<a href=""#r127"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r127"">127</a>].</p>"
"<p>In addition to the abovementioned clinical trials comparing NSAIDs to placebo, several studies have compared the antidepressant effects of different types of NSAIDs. Field <em>et al.</em> [<a href=""#r140"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r140"">140</a>] performed a study to assess the effect of celecoxib and naproxen on depressive symptoms in older adults. Cognitively normal participants aged at least 70 years with a family history of Alzheimer-like dementia were randomly assigned to treatment with celecoxib 200 mg bid, naproxen sodium 220 mg bid, or placebo. The 30-item version of the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) was used to measure depressive symptoms at enrollment and at yearly follow-up visits, while participants with a GDS score &gt; 5 at baseline were identified as depressed. The results of this study were negative, showing that neither celecoxib nor naproxen improved depressive symptoms over time compared to the placebo. Iyengar and collaborators [<a href=""#r141"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r141"">141</a>] conducted a study to investigate the possible antidepressant effect of three NSAIDs in patients with active osteoarthritis. This study pooled data from 5 postapproval trials. Patients were randomly distributed to receiving ibuprofen 800 mg 3 times daily or naproxen 500 mg twice daily, celebrex 200 mg daily or placebo for 6 weeks. Depression was evaluated using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). The results showed that the ibuprofen or naproxen group and the celebrex group exhibited a detectable effect in reducing the PHQ-9 score. Regarding changes in depression classification, logistic regression analysis showed a trend towards a significant treatment effect for all the included NSAIDs compared to placebo. Another study was performed by Mohammadinejad and colleagues [<a href=""#r142"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r142"">142</a>] to compare the efficacy and safety of selective inhibitors of COX-2 with nonselective inhibitors of both COX-1 and COX-2 in reducing depressive symptoms of patients with breast cancer. Fifty-two outpatients aged 18-70 years with breast cancer and mild to moderate depression (HDRS score ≤ 18), who suffered from pain and needed analgesics, were randomly divided to receive treatment with celecoxib (200 mg bid) or diclofenac (50 mg bid) for 6 weeks. The results showed that in the 6th week, the HDRS score of the celecoxib group was significantly improved compared to that of the diclofenac group.</p>"
"<p>Although the intended activity of antibiotics is to kill or prevent the growth of harmful pathogenic microorganisms, these drugs may also directly affect host factors unrelated to the infection. Some of these antibiotics are neuroprotective, such as minocycline, a synthetic broad-spectrum antibacterial tetracycline that exerts neuroprotective function through anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory mechanisms [<a href=""#r143"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r143"">143</a>], and rapamycin, an antifungal agent with apoptotic and pro-autophagic properties that provide neuroprotective effect [<a href=""#r144"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r144"">144</a>].</p>"
"<p>To a certain extent, the ability of minocycline to prevent microglial activation may overlap with its anti-inflammatory properties. It could efficiently cross the BBB and inhibit microglial proliferation by interfering with p38 MAPK, thereby reducing cytokine release and cytokine receptor expression [<a href=""#r145"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r145"">145</a>, <a href=""#r146"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r146"">146</a>]. Emadi-Kouchak <em>et al.</em> [<a href=""#r147"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r147"">147</a>] investigated the antidepressant effects of minocycline in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected patients with mild-to-moderate depression (HDRS score up to 18) in a trial. In addition to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the included patients were randomized to receive minocycline (100 mg bid) or a matching placebo for 6 weeks. Results showed a significant improvement in HDRS scores from baseline to weeks 3 and 6 in the minocycline group compared to the placebo group. Besides, there were significantly more partial responders (as defined by a 25-50% reduction in HDRS score) in the minocycline group than in the placebo group at both weeks 3 and 6. However, the study conducted by Dean <em>et al.</em> [<a href=""#r148"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r148"">148</a>] examined adjunctive minocycline in addition to treatment as usual for MDD. Patients diagnosed with MDD by DSM-IV criteria (MINI PLUS 5, MADRS score ≥ 25) were allocated to treatment with 200 mg/day of minocycline or placebo for 12 weeks. An extra follow-up was also conducted 4 weeks after the end of the treatment phase. There were no significant differences observed between minocycline and placebo groups in MADRS score, MADRS reduction, response rate, and remission rate during 12 weeks of treatment and 4 weeks after treatment (week 16). Similarly, Husain and collaborators [<a href=""#r149"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r149"">149</a>] performed a smaller-sample study where the inclusion criteria were a diagnosis of TRD based on the DSM-V criteria. In addition to treatment as usual, the individuals also received minocycline (100 mg once daily and increased to 200 mg after 2 weeks) or a matching placebo for 12 weeks. The researchers obtained positive results with a significant reduction in HAMD scores in the minocycline group compared to the placebo group. It is important to note that most of the participants in this trial were receiving SSRI antidepressants as part of their usual care, and most were also using an augmenting agent. Recently, Nettis <em>et al.</em> [<a href=""#r150"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r150"">150</a>] conducted a 4-week clinical trial of 39 patients with elevated serum CRP levels (hs-CRP ≥ 1 mg/L) to test whether minocycline enhanced antidepressant efficacy in patients with TRD (HDRS score ≥ 14). The patients were randomized to receive minocycline (200 mg/day) or a placebo added to treatment as usual. The HDRS was used to assess symptom severity and treatment response. Interestingly, in the specially selected sample of patients with elevated CRP (≥ 1 mg/L), minocycline and placebo did not differ significantly in the improvement of depressive symptoms at week 4. However, patients with baseline hs-CRP levels ≥ 3 mg/L had a substantially increased response to minocycline compared to the other groups. In another trial, Attwells <em>et al.</em> [<a href=""#r151"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r151"">151</a>] demonstrated no significant differences between minocycline and placebo groups in reducing HDRS, and in altering TSPO VT within PFC, ACC, and insula in patients with TRD. These results were obtained through HDRS assessment and [18F]FEPPA PET scan before and after oral administration of minocycline 100 mg bid or placebo in a randomized double-blinded manner for 8 weeks.</p>"
"<p>In terms of rapamycin, it was first identified in a <em>Streptomyces</em> isolate found on Easter Island and later developed as an antifungal agent [<a href=""#r152"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r152"">152</a>]. Recently, the antifungal ability of rapamycin has gradually been supplanted by its immunosuppressive and anticytoproliferative properties. It is now approved and widely used to prevent organ transplant rejection and cancer treatment [<a href=""#r145"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r145"">145</a>]. Meanwhile, ketamine is an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist that exerts a rapid and powerful antidepressant effect. The mechanism by which this drug and its metabolites exert their antidepressant effects is thought to be primarily related to the activation of synaptic α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid glutamate receptors (AMPARs) by inducing a surge in prefrontal glutamate neurotransmission. Subsequently, the increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) activates the TrkB receptor, which in turn activates the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), thus leading to synaptogenesis [<a href=""#r153"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r153"">153</a>-<a href=""#r156"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r156"">156</a>]. In line with this, Abdallah <em>et al.</em> [<a href=""#r157"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r157"">157</a>] tested the effect of rapamycin on the antidepressant effect of ketamine. In the double-blind crossover-designed clinical trial, 20 patients with MDD were randomly assigned to receive pretreatment with oral rapamycin (6 mg) or placebo 2 hours before the open-label intravenous infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg). The time between the separated crossover treatments was at least 2 weeks apart, and depression severity was evaluated by MADRS. Rapamycin pretreatment did not alter the antidepressant effect of ketamine in terms of HDRS scores at 24 hours post-injection. But over the subsequent 2 weeks, the authors found a significant treatment interaction with time, showing that rapamycin prolonged the antidepressant effects of ketamine. Two weeks after the ketamine infusion, response and remission rates were higher with rapamycin plus ketamine than with placebo plus ketamine.</p>"
"<p>In recent years, many studies have reported that depression and diabetes are highly comorbid and influence each other. Considering the intrinsic link between them, and the potential anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects of antidiabetic drugs [<a href=""#r158"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r158"">158</a>], the possible effects of antidiabetic drugs on depressive symptoms have been examined. Technically, the most used antidiabetic drug classes include biguanides, sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones (TZDs), α-glucosidase inhibitors (AGIs), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i), glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA), and sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) [<a href=""#r158"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r158"">158</a>].</p>"
"<p>Pioglitazone, a TZD antidiabetic drug, is a highly selective peroxisome proliferator activator gamma receptor (PPAR-γ) agonist. Its main mechanism of action is to activate PPAR-γ, thereby sensitizing the transcription of insulin-responsive genes and regulating the production, transportation, and utilization of glucose. In addition, PPAR-γ possesses important anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, antioxidant, and anti-excitotoxic properties [<a href=""#r159"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r159"">159</a>]. The first double-blind placebo-controlled study addressing the efficacy of pioglitazone in MDD was performed by Sepanjnia <em>et al.</em> [<a href=""#r160"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r160"">160</a>]. The inclusion criteria were a diagnosis of MDD according to the DSM-IV-TR criteria and an HDRS score ≥ 22. After the screening, the patients were separated into groups that received citalopram plus pioglitazone (15 mg every 12 h) or matching citalopram plus placebo for 6 weeks. HDRS was used to evaluate depressive symptoms at baseline and at weeks 2, 4 and 6. The results showed that HDRS scores in the pioglitazone group were significantly lower than those in the placebo group throughout the treatment period. Also, the response and remission rate were significantly higher in the pioglitazone group compared to the placebo group. Subsequently, Lin <em>et al.</em> [<a href=""#r161"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r161"">161</a>] conducted a study to evaluate the effects of adjuvant therapy with the PPAR-γ agonist pioglitazone on depressive symptoms. Patients with non-psychotic, non-remitting depression receiving treatment as usual for depression were randomized across an insulin sensitivity spectrum to the treatment as usual plus pioglitazone (30 mg/day) or a matching placebo for 12 weeks. Clinical tests, including glucose tests (baseline and week 12) and HDRS (baseline and weeks 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12), were used to assess systematic improvements. Although there was a significant decrease in HDRS scores in both pioglitazone and control groups from baseline to week 12, the decline in HDRS scores did not differ significantly between the two groups. Besides, in the pioglitazone group, changes in HDRS were positively correlated to changes in the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). We noticed that baseline depressive symptoms of most of the participants enrolled in this study were roughly mild-to-moderate (HDRS = 17.26 ± 5.52 for the pioglitazone group, HDRS = 13.94 ± 4.03 for the placebo group; data presented as mean ± standard deviation), which may affect amounts of reduction in HDRS scores to some extent. Another study examining the predictive role of peripheral leukocyte telomere length (LTL) in the antidepressant effect of PPAR-γ agonists was conducted by Rasgon <em>et al.</em> [<a href=""#r162"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r162"">162</a>]. Medically stable patients with non-remitted depression were treated with adjunctive pioglitazone (30 mg/day) or placebo in addition to treatment-as-usual for 12 weeks. Clinical improvements were assessed by OGTT, LTL measurements, and HDRS. The result showed that patients with longer baseline telomeres exhibited greater declines in depression severity in the pioglitazone arm, but not in the placebo arm.</p>"

Depressive symptoms were assessed by HDRS score at weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12, while several serum biomarkers were measured before and after therapy. Improvements in HDRS total scores were significantly higher in the metformin group than in the placebo group after 4, 8, and 12 weeks of treatment. Also, response and remission rates were significantly higher in the metformin group. Furthermore, based on the detection of serum biomarkers, the authors attributed these clinical improvements in the metformin group to its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective effects.

Santanello <em>et al.</em> [<a href=""#r168"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r168"">168</a>] evaluated, through CES-D scales, the effect of administering lovastatin on older patients aged ≥ 65 years. In this study, participants with LDL level ranging from 159 mg/dL to 221 mg/dL were randomly assigned to receive diet plus placebo, diet plus 20 mg/day of lovastatin, or diet plus 40 mg/day of lovastatin. Assessments regarding health-related quality of life, including CES-D, were completed at baseline and 6 months post-treatment. The results showed no statistically significant differences between treatment groups in terms of changes in CES-D scores and other health-related quality-of-life measures. Ghanizadeh and Hedayati [<a href=""#r169"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r169"">169</a>] performed another trial to investigate the augmentation of fluoxetine with lovastatin for treating MDD. This study included 61 patients with MDD who met the DSM-IV criteria and allowed them to receive treatment with fluoxetine (up to 40 mg/day) plus lovastatin (30 mg/day) or matched fluoxetine plus placebo. Depressive symptoms were evaluated using HDRS at baseline, week 2, and week 6. During the treatment period, HDRS scores significantly decreased in both groups, while in the lovastatin-combination group, they decreased more than placebo at the end of the trial.</p>"
"<p>Stewart <em>et al.</em> [<a href=""#r170"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r170"">170</a>] conducted a 4-year trial to assess the effect of long-term reduction of serum cholesterol with pravastatin sodium on psychological well-being. There was no significant difference in depression found between pravastatin (40 mg/day) and placebo treatment. The results were obtained by evaluating the general health questionnaire (GHQ) and calculating “depression cases” based on GHQ scores. Carlsson <em>et al.</em> [<a href=""#r171"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r171"">171</a>] evaluated, through the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15), the effect of receiving pravastatin and tocopherol (vitamin E) alone and in combination, on health-related quality of life in older adults. The enrolled subjects were divided into two groups: group 1 received pravastatin for 6 months and then pravastatin plus tocopherol for another 6 months; group 2 received tocopherol for 6 months and then pravastatin plus tocopherol for an additional 6 months. After 6 and 12 months, there were no significant changes found in depression or other measures of health-related quality of life in either group.</p>"
"<p>The study by Gougol <em>et al.</em> [<a href=""#r172"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r172"">172</a>] included patients diagnosed with MDD who fulfilled the DSM-IV TR criteria with an HDRS score ≥ 25. The simvastatin group received fluoxetine (up to 40 mg/day) plus simvastatin (20 mg/day) for 6 weeks, while the placebo group received matching fluoxetine plus placebo. Evaluations were performed using HDRS at baseline and weeks 2, 4, and 6. The results of this study were positive, showing that depressed patients treated with adjuvant simvastatin had significantly greater reductions and early improvements in HDRS scores and higher response rates compared to placebo. However, another study conducted by Chan <em>et al.</em> [<a href=""#r173"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r173"">173</a>] suggested that high-dose simvastatin treatment for 24 months significantly increased depression as determined by the HRDS score in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. But this result was not statistically different between the simvastatin and placebo-treated groups.</p>"
"<p>According to the randomized, double-blind clinical trial performed by Haghighi and collaborators [<a href=""#r174"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r174"">174</a>], adjuvant atorvastatin improved depressive symptoms and blood lipid values in patients suffering from MDD. In this study, the diagnosis of MDD was according to DSM-V criteria, while the improvement was evaluated by HDRS. Only patients with an HDRS score ≥ 25 were included and assigned to receive atorvastatin (20 mg/day) or placebo in addition to the standard medication of 40 mg/day citalopram. Furthermore, Abbasi <em>et al.</em> [<a href=""#r175"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r175"">175</a>] conducted a trial to compare the probable antidepressant effects of simvastatin and atorvastatin in post-coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) patients. Individuals aged 18-50 years with a history of CABG within the past 6 months and who met DSM IV-TR criteria for the diagnosis of MDD with an HDRS score of ≤ 19 were included in the study. They were randomized to receive treatment with either simvastatin (20 mg/day) or atorvastatin (20 mg/day) for 6 weeks. Improvements in depression were assessed by HDRS at baseline, week 3, and week 6. The results demonstrated a greater improvement in depressive symptoms in the simvastatin group than in the atorvastatin group throughout the treatment course without any serious adverse effect. Moreover, patients receiving simvastatin showed a faster response to treatment compared to the atorvastatin group.</p>"
"<p>Early in 1995, Arana <em>et al.</em> [<a href=""#r176"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r176"">176</a>] published a trial that assessed the effectiveness of dexamethasone for the treatment of depression. Briefly, thirty-seven outpatients diagnosed with MDD according to DSM-III-R criteria (also HDRS &gt; 20) were randomly assigned to receive either placebo or 4 mg/day of oral dexamethasone for 4 days. Baseline HDRS scores were compared to scores obtained 14 days after the first dose of the study drug. “Response” was identified as a reduction in HDRS score ≥ 50% from baseline or a terminal HDRS scale score ≤ 14. Eventually, the frequency of response of the dexamethasone group was found to be significantly greater than the percentage of the placebo group. Similarly, DeBattista <em>et al.</em> [<a href=""#r177"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r177"">177</a>] conducted another study to examine the acute antidepressant effects of intravenous hydrocortisone and ovine corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) infusions in patients with MDD who met DSM-III-R criteria. The recruited patients were randomized into groups receiving intravenously 1 µg/kg of ovine CRH, 15 mg of hydrocortisone, or saline in a double-blind fashion on day 1. HDRS assessments were completed before the study and the day after the treatment. The results exhibited that the improvement in depression scores in the hydrocortisone group was significantly higher than that in the ovine CRH group and placebo group. However, the findings may be biased due to the short interval between the two HRDS assessments. Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), an active endogenous compound naturally existing in the CNS, is an endocannabinoid-like lipid mediator with anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antimicrobial, immunomodulatory, and neuroprotective effects [<a href=""#r178"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r178"">178</a>]. To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of PEA add-on therapy for depression, Ghazizadeh-Hashemi <em>et al.</em> [<a href=""#r179"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r179"">179</a>] performed a study including 54 patients with MDD (DSM-V) and an HDRS score ≥ 19. These subjects were randomly allocated into groups receiving either PEA (600 mg bid) or placebo in addition to citalopram (40 mg/day) for 6 weeks. Depressive symptoms were evaluated using HDRS at baseline and weeks 2, 4 and 6. Compared to the placebo group, patients treated with PEA plus citalopram demonstrated a significantly greater reduction in HDRS scores from week 2 to week 6. Moreover, at the end of this trial, the PEA group also had a higher rate of response, not remission, than the placebo group.</p>"
"<p>Since the pathogenesis of MDD involves intricate pathophysiological mechanisms, complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is widely used in its treatment [<a href=""#r180"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r180"">180</a>]. In addition to the above-mentioned drugs, there are many other anti-inflammatory methods for treating major depression. Many Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) formulations and single Chinese herbs have been used to treat depression. A systematic review by Yeung and collaborators [<a href=""#r181"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r181"">181</a>] combined the previous trials and evaluated the efficacy, safety, and type of CHM for major depression. It showed that the most frequently used formulas were Xiaoyao decoction, Chaihu Shugan decoction and Ganmai Dazao decoction, while Chaihu (<em>Bupleurum chinense</em> DC.), Baishao (<em>Paeonia lactiflora</em> Pall.) and Fuling (<em>Poria Cocos (Schw.)</em> Wolf.) were the most commonly used single herbs. Besides, Gancao (<em>Glycyrrhiza uralensis</em> Fisch.) is the shared ingredient in all three of the formulas [<a href=""#r181"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r181"">181</a>]. Specifically, Jianghuang (<em>Curcuma longa</em> L.) is known for its anti-inflammatory effects by modulating NF-κB and reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines, as well as for its antioxidant effects [<a href=""#r182"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r182"">182</a>]. Curcumin, a polyphenolic compound, is the main constituent of this CHM. At least 10 clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate its antidepressant effects [<a href=""#r183"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r183"">183</a>-<a href=""#r191"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r191"">191</a>]. Despite differences in doses, formulations, or adjuvants, the combined results suggest that curcumin is effective in improving depression in humans [<a href=""#r182"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r182"">182</a>]. Likewise, glycyrrhizic acid (GZA, the main component of Gancao) has been recently reported to improve symptoms in depressed patients (especially baseline CRP &gt; 3 mg/L) better than placebo when used in combination with SSRIs. A reduction in TNF-α partially mediated the association between GZA treatment and clinical improvement [<a href=""#r192"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r192"">192</a>].</p>"
"<p>Although pharmacotherapy remains the primary treatment modality for MDD, given its anti-inflammatory properties, lifestyle modification has emerged as a potential non-pharmacological anti-depressive approach that has been studied in clinical practice [<a href=""#r7"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r7"">7</a>]. First, in terms of dietary strategy, several nutrients, foods, or dietary supplements with anti-inflammatory effects have been examined for treating MDD. Meta-analyses of clinical findings suggest that moderate consumption of fish and other food of “high quality” is linked to a lower risk of depression, especially in women [<a href=""#r193"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r193"">193</a>, <a href=""#r194"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r194"">194</a>]. These foods, especially oily fishes as well as fish oil, are rich in ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), particularly docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6 ω-3) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5 ω-3). In-depth studies demonstrate that EPA, but not DHA, is responsible for the most antidepressant effects of ω-3 PUFA [<a href=""#r195"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r195"">195</a>, <a href=""#r196"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r196"">196</a>]. Apart from seafood rich in ω-3 PUFA, fruits and vegetables with adequate vitamins, beverages containing sufficient polyphenols, probiotic foods that module gut microbiota, and a Mediterranean diet with a low dietary inflammatory index are also promising antidepressant dietary options [<a href=""#r197"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r197"">197</a>]. Second, physical exercise has been shown to enhance brain function and reduce neurodegeneration by enhancing neuroplasticity, as well as modulating neuroinflammation and microglial activation, and is therefore used in the treatment of neurological and psychiatric diseases [<a href=""#r198"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r198"">198</a>, <a href=""#r199"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r199"">199</a>]. Accumulating meta-analytic studies pooling clinical trials suggest that exercise moderately improves major depressive disorder and depressive symptoms [<a href=""#r200"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r200"">200</a>, <a href=""#r201"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r201"">201</a>], whether as monotherapy, adjunctive therapy, or combination therapy [<a href=""#r202"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r202"">202</a>]. However, exercise regimens are often highly heterogeneous, with different types, intensities, durations, and frequencies. Third, as an effective stress relieving method, the effects of mindfulness-based interventions (MBI) on cytokine and cortisol levels have been studied, and there are promising data supporting that interventions significantly reduce inflammation [<a href=""#r203"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r203"">203</a>, <a href=""#r204"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r204"">204</a>]. In fact, many trials have already been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of MBI, including mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), MBCT, and mindfulness meditation (MM), in improving MDD. In general, these mindfulness-based therapies are effective in reducing depressive symptoms and depression relapse [<a href=""#r205"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r205"">205</a>, <a href=""#r206"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r206"">206</a>]. As Johannsen and colleagues [<a href=""#r207"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r207"">207</a>] concluded in a meta-analysis, putative mediators of acceptance and mindfulness-based therapies, including mindful attention, decentering, and acceptance, mediated treatment effects on anxiety and depression. Current evidence also suggests that mindfulness can treat depression by targeting the very inflammatory pathways associated with a worse prognosis in cancer [<a href=""#r203"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r203"">203</a>]. Collectively, countless clinical studies have demonstrated the anti-inflammatory effects of lifestyle changes, such as exercise, diet, and MBI in the context of depression and other psychological issues. However, most of them are less evidence-based (especially with substantial methodological flaws) compared to pharmacological treatments [<a href=""#r7"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r7"">7</a>]. Clinicians and patients still need to be cautious when applying these non-pharmacological therapies.</p>"
"<p>This article has briefly introduced the rationale of anti-inflammatory therapy for depression and provided a comprehensive review of the current clinical evidence for anti-inflammation-targeted therapies for depression. The results suggest that anti-inflammatory therapy can effectively improve depressive symptoms under certain conditions, whether as a monotherapy or as an add-on therapy. Specifically, it is mainly manifested in the following aspects: (1) Promoting the reduction of rating scale scores in patients with MDD, and improving the response and remission rate; (2) Hastening the onset of traditional serotonergic antidepressants; (3) Improving depressive symptoms in patients with somatic diseases, such as inflammatory diseases, metabolic disorders, and tumors. However, these results should be implemented with caution. There is still much confusion with respect to the application of anti-inflammatory therapy for MDD. These studies also suggest that routine diagnosis should be complemented with the assessment of biological factors, such as inflammatory biomarkers, to identify effective treatments for depression, including anti-inflammatory drugs. Moreover, considering the lack of evidence to support the standard regimens of anti-inflammatory therapy, issues including drug dosage, the timing of dosing or withdrawal, and assessment tools, still need to be explored.</p>"
"<p>Generally, when conventional antidepressant monotherapy fails to produce a satisfactory response to depressive symptoms, in addition to switching drugs, augmenting the antidepressant effect with an adjunctive treatment modality is a common strategy. During the past few decades, many reports have linked depression with inflammation, cytokines, or neuroinflammation, but few high-quality clinical trials are devoted to examining the effectiveness, efficiency, efficacy, and safety of anti-inflammatory treatment for MDD. Kohler <em>et al.</em> [<a href=""#r208"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r208"">208</a>] conducted a meta-analysis study based on 14 trials, 10 of which evaluated the use of NSAIDs and 4 that examined cytokine inhibitors. The combined effect demonstrated a robust result that anti-inflammatory treatment reduced depressive symptoms compared to placebo in patients with MDD and depressive symptoms. In another meta-analysis examining the efficacy of anti-inflammatory treatment on depression by Kohler and collaborators [<a href=""#r106"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r106"">106</a>], 36 random clinical trials involving 6 classes of drugs were identified and included. The results confirmed that anti-inflammatory agents as add-ons improved depressive symptoms compared to placebo in MDD patients. Also, the combined use of anti-inflammatory with conventional therapy significantly improved response and remission rates. Further, Adzic <em>et al.</em> [<a href=""#r209"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r209"">209</a>] comprehensively discussed the utility and inadequacy of antidepressant strategies focused on inflammatory pathways based on previous preclinical and clinical findings. They concluded that SSRIs exhibited a strong beneficial effect in restraining inflammatory cytokines in depression, while different anti-inflammatory agents exerted antidepressant effects <em>via</em> different mechanisms. Adjunctive use of anti-inflammatory treatment is a feasible augmentative therapy for patients with moderate-to-severe depression. Kopschina Feltes <em>et al.</em> [<a href=""#r210"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r210"">210</a>] and Shariq <em>et al.</em> [<a href=""#r211"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r211"">211</a>] hold the same viewpoints. They also suggest that serum levels of inflammatory biomarkers (primarily IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and hs-CRP) in depressed patients are useful biomarkers that can be used in combination with the assessment of depression scores.</p>"
"<p>In terms of treatment goals, we expect that the application of anti-inflammatory therapy for MDD is supposed to achieve: (1) A stronger effect. It is widely known that the commonly used traditional monoaminergic antidepressants only achieve a 67% remission rate after 4 steps of treatment [<a href=""#r5"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r5"">5</a>]. Two-thirds of patients with depression will not remit after initial antidepressant treatment [<a href=""#r212"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r212"">212</a>], while only half of the patients have significant clinical responses after taking antidepressants [<a href=""#r213"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r213"">213</a>]. Therefore, the urgent expectation at this stage is that anti-inflammatory therapy should substantially strengthen the response and remission rate of these traditional drugs. Nonetheless, we do not insist that an anti-inflammatory strategy is the only way to help achieve this goal. Other augmentative options may include regular aerobic exercise, good social support, appropriate psychotherapy, healthy diet and supplements, <em>etc</em>. [<a href=""#r28"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r28"">28</a>] (2) A faster onset. The traditional monoaminergic antidepressants commonly used at present have relatively a delayed response and an onset of action ranging from hours to days, even up to weeks [<a href=""#r214"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r214"">214</a>]. Apart from anti-inflammatory drugs, ketamine and its derivates have been reported to have a rapid onset followed by sustained action mediated by a complex multi-target mechanism, including modulation of inflammation [<a href=""#r215"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r215"">215</a>, <a href=""#r216"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r216"">216</a>] and upregulation of BDNF [<a href=""#r214"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r214"">214</a>]. (3) A higher acceptance. On one hand, many current antidepressants have drug-related side effects, including headache, nausea or vomiting, agitation, sedation, and sexual dysfunction, which may affect patient tolerance and compliance [<a href=""#r217"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r217"">217</a>]. On the other hand, the heavy use of antidepressants imposes an enormous economic burden on patients and public health services. The annual total expenditure for antidepressants has been reported to be approximately US$17.4 billion in the US [<a href=""#r218"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r218"">218</a>]. Moreover, TRD patients involve significantly higher healthcare resource utilization, translating into higher average total costs (US$21,015(TRD) <em>vs.</em> US$14,712(No TRD)) and MDD-related costs (US$1201(TRD) <em>vs.</em> US$471(No TRD)) compared to non-TRD patients [<a href=""#r219"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r219"">219</a>]. Besides, developing a new antidepressant drug is also expensive for pharmaceutical companies.</p>"
"<p>From our point of view, there are still the following problems to be solved in the anti-inflammatory treatment of depression, which are related to stratified and personalized treatment.</p>"
"<p>As mentioned earlier, the majority of clinical trials of anti-inflammatory therapy for depression recruit participants based on rating scale scores without adequate consideration of physiological indicators, and there are indeed no biomarkers to rely on for the diagnosis of depression at present. Further, many of the early studies (especially those investigating cytokine inhibitors) included patients with comorbid diseases, such as inflammatory diseases [<a href=""#r110"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r110"">110</a>, <a href=""#r111"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r111"">111</a>, <a href=""#r115"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r115"">115</a>, <a href=""#r117"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r117"">117</a>-<a href=""#r119"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r119"">119</a>, <a href=""#r121"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r121"">121</a>, <a href=""#r123"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r123"">123</a>-<a href=""#r125"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r125"">125</a>]. In studies specifically targeting MDD, sample sizes were generally small (about 30 subjects per arm), and multicenter studies were lacking. Moreover, since the prevalence of depression in women is about twice as high as in men [<a href=""#r220"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r220"">220</a>], there may be gender differences in the pathophysiology of depression onset and development. Accordingly, the effect of anti-inflammatory treatment may also vary by gender [<a href=""#r132"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r132"">132</a>]. Besides, among the patients diagnosed with depression according to DSM criteria, we should consider the type (relapse or first episode, drug-naïve or treatment-resistant) and severity (mild, moderate, or severe) of the patients who will receive anti-inflammatory therapy. Based on the studies reviewed in this article, the treatment effects of mild/moderate and severe MDD seem to be inconsistent [<a href=""#r147"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r147"">147</a>, <a href=""#r148"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r148"">148</a>]. Meanwhile, the subjects of recent studies are mainly patients with TRD [<a href=""#r136"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r136"">136</a>, <a href=""#r150"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r150"">150</a>, <a href=""#r151"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r151"">151</a>].</p>"
"<p>Most of the studies included in this article used combination therapy, where anti-inflammatory agents were given as an adjunct to treatment as usual (including antidepressants, mood stabilizers, and antipsychotics, as well as psychotherapy and other psychosocial interventions) [<a href=""#r149"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r149"">149</a>, <a href=""#r162"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r162"">162</a>]. However, considering comorbidities and clinical ethics, cytokine inhibitors are currently more often used as monotherapy [<a href=""#r110"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r110"">110</a>, <a href=""#r111"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r111"">111</a>, <a href=""#r113"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r113"">113</a>, <a href=""#r115"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r115"">115</a>, <a href=""#r118"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r118"">118</a>, <a href=""#r119"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r119"">119</a>, <a href=""#r121"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r121"">121</a>, <a href=""#r123"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r123"">123</a>-<a href=""#r125"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r125"">125</a>]. In terms of which anti-inflammatory intervention/drug should be selected, the current research results still cannot answer this question. Considering the complex interconnection of biological functions of different cytokines, these inflammatory mediators are usually defined as networks. So it may be easier to understand that selective anti-inflammatory agents can not only cause significant changes in specific target molecules, but also affect other components in this network. Since it is not yet determined which cytokine is the most crucial therapeutic target, the application of one or more safe, stable, economic, and effective broad-spectrum anti-inflammatory drugs may be an acceptable option at this stage. As for the dosage, the currently recommended dosages of anti-inflammatory drugs for MDD are mainly based on the dosages used to treat inflammatory diseases. For example, the suggested dose of celecoxib is mostly 200 mg bid (400 mg/day) [<a href=""#r130"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r130"">130</a>-<a href=""#r133"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r133"">133</a>, <a href=""#r135"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r135"">135</a>, <a href=""#r140"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r140"">140</a>-<a href=""#r142"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r142"">142</a>]. However, studies on the dose-effect relationship are scarce.</p>"
"<p>According to the included literature, most studies still use symptomatic rating scales, either self-rated or examiner-rated, to evaluate the effect of anti-inflammatory therapy on depression. However, there may be ceiling/floor and concealed effects in these trials due to the heterogeneity in the mean baseline depression scores of the patients. In a meta-analysis of placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials of antidepressants, Maslej <em>et al.</em> [<a href=""#r221"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r221"">221</a>] included 91 eligible trials with a total of 18,965 participants. As a result, they found no evidence that variability in observed response (as measured by total depression scores) among participants receiving antidepressants was greater than among those receiving a placebo. Hence, they suggest that future studies explore whether individual symptom scores or biomarkers are associated with variability in response to antidepressants. Despite hs-CRP, emerging research on the role of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR) in depression also suggests NLR to be significantly associated with depression, and that it can be used as an indicator of depression [<a href=""#r222"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r222"">222</a>-<a href=""#r224"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r224"">224</a>].</p>"
"<p>In addition to the above concerns, there are other issues that need to be addressed. For example, is the mechanism by which anti-inflammatory drugs act as antidepressants by modulating inflammation a direct (or an indirect) effect? If so, which one is their target, central or peripheral inflammation? This may determine whether drug candidates should have the ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier. Some studies have speculated that the reason why patients with high inflammation are more responsive to this therapy is that they have insufficient BBB integrity [<a href=""#r21"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r21"">21</a>, <a href=""#r95"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r95"">95</a>]. Another key question is: among the present candidate molecules, whether there are specific targets of inflammation leading to depression, which can be used for diagnosis and treatment? As mentioned earlier, different inflammatory factors have been found to be closely related to depression and are presumed to be biological targets of depression. However, there is still insufficient evidence to support the effectiveness of any single target [<a href=""#r225"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r225"">225</a>]. In order to improve the sensitivity and specificity of inflammatory indicators, we have proposed to use a biomarker panel instead of a single/specific one [<a href=""#r226"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r226"">226</a>]. However, this is just an idea based on previous research and has not been verified by large-scale clinical research. A major obstacle at this stage is that there are still disputes about which biomarkers should be included. We believe that, in the future, the wide application of big data and the rapid progress of medical testing technology may accelerate the establishment of this panel.</p>"
"<p>It is not difficult to understand from the above evidence that the treatment methods based on the inflammation hypothesis of depression highly address the adjustment of the immune system. In addition to these methods that have already been applied in clinical trials, the rapid progress in basic and preclinical research also provides new targets. Here, we have briefly summarized several representative and prospective treatment conceptions close to translational applications.</p>"
"<p>As immune cells are stationed in the CNS, microglia can sense and react to danger signals, thus affecting neurogenesis and depression-like behavior. Despite the controversy, the classification of M1 and M2 subtypes represents different functional states of microglia. Under stress, microglia are induced towards the M1 type, releasing inflammatory factors and causing a neuroinflammatory reaction. After the inflammation subsides, microglia shift towards the alternative activated M2 phenotypes, which is responsible for neuroprotection [<a href=""#r227"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r227"">227</a>-<a href=""#r229"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r229"">229</a>]. Therefore, the switching of microglia activation phenotype is a possible treatment for depression, especially in terms of reducing the M1 phenotype and increasing the M2 phenotype [<a href=""#r230"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r230"">230</a>]. It has been shown that pretreatment of anti-inflammatory IL-10 before LPS administration can prevent the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF-α, IL-6, and COX-2 [<a href=""#r231"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r231"">231</a>]. Besides, glatiramer acetate (GA) is a promising molecule that can alter the inflammatory environment by recruiting Th2 T cells into the CNS, induce the production of another anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-4, and improve depressive-like behavior [<a href=""#r232"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r232"">232</a>]. More interestingly, there is evidence that PPAR-γ can inhibit the activation of microglia, promote M2 polarization, and inhibit inflammatory cytokines, which is considered to be a major reason why PPAR-γ agonists can play an anti-inflammatory and antidepressant role [<a href=""#r233"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r233"">233</a>]. Similarly, minocycline is a microglia activity inhibitor that can selectively prevent M1 microglia from polarization into a pro-inflammatory state [<a href=""#r234"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r234"">234</a>]. In the future, even allogeneic blood exchange and mesenchymal stem cell transplantation may become options for transforming microglia.</p>"
"<p>Toll-like receptors (TLR) are a major class of receptors for detecting DAMP and PAMP. It is essential for the innate immune response and sterile inflammation of the CNS associated with depression [<a href=""#r6"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r6"">6</a>, <a href=""#r80"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r80"">80</a>]. Animal studies have shown that TLR4 plays a key role in regulating neuroinflammation and depressive-like behavior [<a href=""#r235"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r235"">235</a>]. Upon ligand recognition, TLR4 activates glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) that activates NF-kB to promote the production of proinflammatory cytokines [<a href=""#r236"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r236"">236</a>]. Recently, some TLR4 ligands have been found to participate in depressive-like behavior, including HMGB1, myeloid-related protein 8/14 (Mrp8/14, also known as S100A8/9), and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) [<a href=""#r237"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r237"">237</a>-<a href=""#r240"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r240"">240</a>]. Different strategies can be adopted to alleviate depressive-like behavior by regulating the release and function of these alarmins. For example, minocycline can inhibit the activation of microglia in mice, reduce the release of HMGB1 from microglia and neurons, and alleviate the behavioral and cognitive deficits caused by chronic stress [<a href=""#r241"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r241"">241</a>]. Ethyl pyruvate (EP) may inhibit the acetylation and release of HMGB1 by affecting the sirtuin1/signal transducer and activator of the transcription (SIRT1/STAT) pathway, and ultimately improve the depressive-like behavior of mice [<a href=""#r242"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r242"">242</a>]. Treatment of mice with GZA, the natural inhibitor of HMGB1, can ameliorate depressive-like behavior by subsequently regulating the key enzymes of the kynurenine pathway [<a href=""#r243"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r243"">243</a>]. Furthermore, TAK-242, a selective inhibitor of TLR4, can significantly block the increase in TNF-α protein and the decrease in myelin basic protein induced by HMGB1 in hippocampi, thus improving the depressive-like behavior of experimental mice [<a href=""#r244"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r244"">244</a>]. Additionally, the Mrp14 inhibitor ABR-215757 effectively restores depressive symptoms and TLR4/NF-κB signaling activation induced by chronic stress [<a href=""#r238"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r238"">238</a>].</p>"
"<p>The important role of IL-1β has already been introduced in this review. In fact, its production and maturation are controlled by the multi-protein complex called inflammasome, which consists of the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor (NLR) family, the effector protease caspase-1, and the adapter apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC). Of all inflammasomes, the NOD-, leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-, and pyrin domain (PYD)-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome has been studied extensively and proposed to be a potential target for the treatment of depression [<a href=""#r245"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r245"">245</a>, <a href=""#r246"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r246"">246</a>]. We have provided the first preclinical evidence linking the NLRP3 inflammasome to depressive symptoms and verified the result by gene knockout [<a href=""#r247"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r247"">247</a>, <a href=""#r248"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r248"">248</a>]. There are also many research reports on the treatment of depression by targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome. Firstly, because caspase-1 is the effector organ responsible for cleaving pro-IL-1β, its inhibitors, such as Ac-YVAD-CMK and VX765, can improve the depressive-like behavior of mice [<a href=""#r247"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r247"">247</a>, <a href=""#r249"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r249"">249</a>]. Secondly, the application of NLRP3 inhibitors, such as MCC950 and glibenclamide, unexpectedly prevents inflammation-related depressive-like behavior [<a href=""#r250"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r250"">250</a>-<a href=""#r252"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r252"">252</a>]. Thirdly, regulating the upstream molecule of NLRP3 inflammasome activation also yields an antidepressant-like effect. Stress-induced depressive-like behavior can be eliminated by P2X7-gene knockout and chronic administration of P2X7 antagonists, such as bright blue G (BBG), A438079, and JNJ-55308942 [<a href=""#r253"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r253"">253</a>-<a href=""#r256"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r256"">256</a>].</p>"
"<p>Based on the cytokine hypothesis of depression and our preclinical [<a href=""#r216"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r216"">216</a>, <a href=""#r238"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r238"">238</a>, <a href=""#r242"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r242"">242</a>, <a href=""#r250"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r250"">250</a>, <a href=""#r257"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r257"">257</a>] and clinical [<a href=""#r192"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r192"">192</a>] findings, coupled with the complex interaction between different cytokines, we have previously proposed a theory of cytokine-network pathogenesis in depression [<a href=""#r12"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r12"">12</a>]. This theory implies that both specificity and sensitivity should be emphasized in the selection of biomarkers for the diagnosis and treatment of depression. That is to say, biomarkers that are more consistently altered across animal models and patients should be preferentially considered. In terms of the selection of therapeutic drugs, it may be a wise choice to use safe, effective, and affordable “old drugs” as adjuvants. In line with this theory, we have developed a novel anti-inflammatory strategy for the diagnosis and treatment of depression (Fig. <strong><a href=""#F1"" class=""usa-link"">1</a></strong>), and provided suggestions for upgrading the current clinical diagnosis and treatment procedures for depression: (1) Detecting serum inflammatory biomarkers, such as hs-CRP and blood cytology analysis, at the first admission of MDD patients (cytokines, including IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α may be comprehensively detected if possible), so they can be identified and classified accordingly; (2) Patients with high inflammation at baseline are suggested to receive combined therapy with broad-spectrum anti-inflammatory drugs. According to the current clinical availability and feasibility, we recommend CRP &gt;3 mg/L as a cut-off value. However, this value has not been widely verified by clinical trials, and it may be premature to use it as the gold standard for inflammatory intervention in clinical practice. Therefore, we only suggest that this value be used for further exploratory research in the future. (3) In order to evaluate the efficacy and predict the prognosis, we should also refer to inflammatory indicators instead of paying too much attention to the rating scales.</p>"

"<p>Flowchart of novel anti-inflammatory strategy for the diagnosis and treatment of depression. Regularly, the outpatients or inpatients who meet the symptomatic diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder will receive pharmacotherapy (primarily monoaminergic antidepressants) and complementary therapies suggested in the current clinical guidelines. In the novel anti-inflammatory strategy, these patients may receive additional inflammatory assessments associated with depression. These indicators mainly include serum hs-CRP levels, blood cytology analysis (routine blood test), serum IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α and other inflammatory cytokines if needed. Based on these screening results, if the patient is classified to be “high-inflammatory”, they were recommended to receive augmentative treatment with broad-spectrum anti-inflammatory agents in combination with treatment as usual. It is worth noting that, in addition to the conventional evaluation methods, we recommend adding continuous monitoring of changes in inflammatory markers during the follow-up visits in the evaluation of efficacy and prognosis of treatment. (<strong>Abbreviations:</strong> MDD, major depressive disorder; hs-CRP, high sensitive C-reaction protein; IL-1β, interleukin-1β; IL-6, interleukin-6; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; SSRIs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors; SNRIs, serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors; NDRIs, norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors).</p>"
"<p>To sum up, anti-inflammatory therapies have a long way to go before they can be widely used in the clinical practice for treating depression as standard treatment. One important reason is that, as Drevets <em>et al.</em> [<a href=""#r258"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r258"">258</a>] demonstrated, it is still difficult to identify whether the depressive symptoms of an MDD patient are caused or exacerbated by inflammation. Therefore, the problem is not to determine the potential anti-inflammatory treatment, but to identify the patients who may benefit from this therapy. Our abovementioned strategy is mainly based on the statistical difference between the immunological characteristics of patients with depression and those without depression. From the perspective of the large-scale application, blood biomarkers are more accessible and the detection methods are more mature, and can provide sufficient mechanistic information regarding the circulating compartment of the peripheral immune system. In addition to the CRP, immune cell count and cytokine level we have mentioned, whole-genome gene expression and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) levels of specific mRNAs [<a href=""#r259"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r259"">259</a>, <a href=""#r260"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r260"">260</a>], and cytokine or gene expression levels stimulated by LPS <em>in vitro</em>, may also help to better profile the immune function [<a href=""#r261"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r261"">261</a>, <a href=""#r262"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r262"">262</a>]. However, the extent of central immune function that can be inferred from peripheral immune markers is still unclear. It is necessary to change our clinical thinking. If accurate enough, a patient selection method based on a clinical phenotype will be more convenient and economical than a biological measurement [<a href=""#r258"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r258"">258</a>]. That is to say, the classic behavioral and symptomatological scales currently used require a substantial revision to distinguish subpopulations of depressive patients more effectively. The development and adoption of immuno-targeted therapy for depression seem to upgrade the diagnosis and stratification principles of MDD and focus instead on transdiagnostic symptom dimensions [<a href=""#r258"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r258"">258</a>, <a href=""#r263"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r263"">263</a>].</p>"
"<p>This review has several limitations. First, considering the search strategy and screening criteria, we may have omitted retrospective studies and some clinical trials that had not taken anti-inflammatory therapy as the primary study design. Second, the antidepressant effects of some drugs not included in this review may also be related to anti-inflammatory effects, but these may only have been found in exploratory analyses and were not the primary outcome. Third, as this is a narrative review, we did not further perform a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the included literature. This part has already been conducted by other studies. Fourth, we have not paid enough attention to side effects, which are reported in only a few studies and are incomplete, and further research is needed.</p>"
"<p>Based on current clinical evidence, anti-inflammatory therapy is an effective and promising treatment for depression. However, there is still a long way to go to move anti-inflammatory therapy from clinical trials to practical guidelines. The next step toward optimizing treatment efficacy should involve upgrading the diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder and assessment of responses to antidepressants based on specific symptom profiles, sets of biomarkers, or a combination of them. Research on etiology and pathophysiological mechanisms also needs to be explored continuously and thoroughly to provide more options for translational applications. The novel strategy for the anti-inflammatory therapy of major depressive disorder presented in the current paper may have implications for clinicians and researchers.</p>"

"<p id=""Par1"">Worldwide, the incidence of major depressive disorder (MDD) is increasing annually, resulting in greater economic and social burdens. Moreover, the pathological mechanisms of MDD and the mechanisms underlying the effects of pharmacological treatments for MDD are complex and unclear, and additional diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for MDD still are needed. The currently widely accepted theories of MDD pathogenesis include the neurotransmitter and receptor hypothesis, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis hypothesis, cytokine hypothesis, neuroplasticity hypothesis and systemic influence hypothesis, but these hypothesis cannot completely explain the pathological mechanism of MDD. Even it is still hard to adopt only one hypothesis to completely reveal the pathogenesis of MDD, thus in recent years, great progress has been made in elucidating the roles of multiple organ interactions in the pathogenesis MDD and identifying novel therapeutic approaches and multitarget modulatory strategies, further revealing the disease features of MDD. Furthermore, some newly discovered potential pharmacological targets and newly studied antidepressants have attracted widespread attention, some reagents have even been approved for clinical treatment and some novel therapeutic methods such as phototherapy and acupuncture have been discovered to have effective improvement for the depressive symptoms. In this work, we comprehensively summarize the latest research on the pathogenesis and diagnosis of MDD, preventive approaches and therapeutic medicines, as well as the related clinical trials.</p>"
"<p><strong>Subject terms:</strong> Diseases of the nervous system, Cellular neuroscience</p>"
"<p id=""Par2"">Major depressive disorder (MDD), a main cause of disability worldwide, is characterized by physical changes such as tiredness, weight loss, and appetite loss. Anhedonia is a classic feature of MDD, and MDD is also accompanied by a lack of drive, sleep issues, cognitive challenges, and emotional symptoms such as guilt.<sup><a href=""#CR1"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR1"">1</a></sup> The prevalence of depression is increasing yearly. About 300 million people in the world are affected by MDD, which has become one of the main causes of disability.<sup><a href=""#CR2"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR2"">2</a></sup> In 2018, MDD ranked third in terms of disease burden according to the WHO, and it is predicted to rank first by 2030.<sup><a href=""#CR3"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR3"">3</a></sup> Pregnant women, elderly people, children, and others have a higher incidence rate of MDD, which may be related to genetic, psychological, and social factors.<sup><a href=""#CR4"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR4"">4</a></sup> Depression can be accompanied by recurrent seizures, which may occur even during remission or persist for longer than the disease itself.<sup><a href=""#CR5"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR5"">5</a></sup> Pharmacological therapies for MDD can effectively control symptoms; thus, patients may experience recurrence within a short time after discontinuing medication.<sup><a href=""#CR6"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR6"">6</a></sup> During recurrence, the patient experiences symptoms of low mood, loss of interest in life, fatigue, delayed thinking, and repeated fluctuations in mental state.<sup><a href=""#CR7"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR7"">7</a></sup></p>"
"<p id=""Par3"">There is a certain correlation between the occurrence of MDD and social development.<sup><a href=""#CR8"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR8"">8</a></sup> A survey reported that with the development of the economy and increased life pressure, MDD has begun to emerge at a younger age, and the incidence of MDD in women is approximately twice that in men.<sup><a href=""#CR9"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR9"">9</a></sup> Specifically, women are more likely to develop depressive symptoms when they encounter social emergencies or are under significant stress.<sup><a href=""#CR8"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR8"">8</a></sup> Additionally, autumn and winter have been reported to be associated with a high incidence of MDD, namely, seasonal depression.<sup><a href=""#CR10"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR10"">10</a></sup></p>"
"<p id=""Par4"">The clinical symptoms of MDD include a depressed mood, loss of interest, changes in weight or appetite, and increased likelihood of committing suicide.<sup><a href=""#CR11"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR11"">11</a></sup> These symptoms are also listed as the criteria for MDD in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5).<sup><a href=""#CR12"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR12"">12</a></sup> In addition to the criteria listed in the DSM-5, the criteria reported in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) are also used to guide clinical diagnosis.<sup><a href=""#CR13"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR13"">13</a></sup> However, due to the lack of characteristic symptoms and objective diagnostic evidence for MDD, identification and early prevention are difficult in the clinic.<sup><a href=""#CR14"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR14"">14</a></sup></p>"
"<p id=""Par5"">Due to the complexity of the pathological mechanism of MDD, accurate diagnostic approaches and pharmacological therapeutic strategies are relatively limited. Several hypothesis were developed to explain MDD pathogenesis pathogenic including (i) the hypothalamic‒pituitary‒adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction hypothesis, (ii) the monoamine hypothesis, (iii) the inflammatory hypothesis, (iv) the genetic and epigenetic anomaly hypothesis, (v) the structural and functional brain remodeling hypothesis, and (vi) the social psychological hypothesis<sup><a href=""#CR3"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR3"">3</a>,<a href=""#CR15"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR15"">15</a>,<a href=""#CR16"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR16"">16</a></sup> (Fig. <a href=""#Fig1"" class=""usa-link"">1</a>). However, none of these hypotheses alone can fully explain the pathological basis of MDD, while many mechanisms proposed by these hypotheses interact with each other. In recent years, great progress has been made in identifying novel pharmacological therapies, diagnostic criteria, and nonpharmacological preventive measures for MDD, initiating related clinical trials. Specifically, increasing evidence suggests that astrocytic dysfunction plays a substantial role in MDD.<sup><a href=""#CR17"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR17"">17</a></sup> Pharmacological ablation of astrocytes in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) causes depressive-like symptoms in experimental animals,<sup><a href=""#CR18"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR18"">18</a></sup> and postmortem studies of patients with MDD have shown reduced densities of glial cells in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus and amygdala.<sup><a href=""#CR19"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR19"">19</a></sup> In addition, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), one of the markers of astrocytes, is expressed at various levels,<sup><a href=""#CR20"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR20"">20</a></sup> and the levels of connexins,<sup><a href=""#CR21"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR21"">21</a></sup> glutamine synthase (GS), glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1),<sup><a href=""#CR21"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR21"">21</a>,<a href=""#CR22"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR22"">22</a></sup> and aquaporin-4 (AQP4)<sup><a href=""#CR23"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR23"">23</a></sup> are reduced in patients with MDD.</p>"

"<p id=""Par8"">Although the etiology of MDD is still unclear, numerous studies have been performed and various models have been employed to explore the genetic factors, environmental factors and gene-environment interactions related to the disease.<sup><a href=""#CR24"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR24"">24</a></sup> Recent family, twin, and adoption studies suggests that genetic factors play a crucial role in the occurrence of MDD.<sup><a href=""#CR25"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR25"">25</a></sup> As a genetically diverse illness, MDD has a heritability of 30–50%.<sup><a href=""#CR26"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR26"">26</a></sup> Over 100 gene loci, including those associated with presynaptic vesicle trafficking (PCLO), dopaminergic neurotransmission (a primary target of antipsychotics), glutamate ionotropic receptor kainate type subunit 5 (GRIK5), and metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (GRM5), and neuronal calcium signaling such as calcium voltage-gated channel subunit alpha1 E (CACNA1E) and calcium voltage-gated channel auxiliary subunit alpha2 delta1 (CACNA2D1), are found to be associated with an increased risk of MDD by genome-wide association studies.<sup><a href=""#CR19"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR19"">19</a>,<a href=""#CR27"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR27"">27</a>,<a href=""#CR28"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR28"">28</a></sup> In addition, rare copy number variants are also identified to be related to MDD risk, there may be three copy number variants (CNV) loci associated with Prader-Willis syndrome: 1q21.1 duplication, 15q11-13, and 16p11.2. However, no single genetic variation has been found to increase the risk of MDD thus far.<sup><a href=""#CR26"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR26"">26</a></sup> Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) identified 178 genetic risk loci and proposed over 200 candidate gene, using of biobank data, novel imputation methods, combined with clinical cases improved the ability to identify MDD specific pathways.<sup><a href=""#CR29"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR29"">29</a></sup> In the study of human MDD transcriptome, there are defects in the transcription levels of somatostatin (SST) in the subgenus anterior cingulate cortex and amygdala of MDD patients,<sup><a href=""#CR30"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR30"">30</a>,<a href=""#CR31"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR31"">31</a></sup> and SST levels are directly involved in the cellular processes that affect the synaptic output of intermediate neuronal circuits.<sup><a href=""#CR32"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR32"">32</a></sup> Recent studies revealed that gender specific genomic differences in MDD patients, the downregulation of the MDD-related gene Dusp6 in females leads to an increased susceptibility to stress, but this expression is not present in male mice.<sup><a href=""#CR33"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR33"">33</a></sup> In addition, studies of drug gene interactions, transcriptional genes associated with the risk of MDD are also reported, such as D2 subtype of the dopamine receptor (DRD2) and fatty acid desaturase (FADS),<sup><a href=""#CR34"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR34"">34</a></sup> which may serve as promising new targets for therapeutic intervention points. Thus, genetic variants are expected to have only minor effects on the overall risk of disease, and various hereditary factors combined with environmental factors such as stress are likely more essential for the development of MDD.<sup><a href=""#CR35"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR35"">35</a></sup></p>"
"<p id=""Par9"">In addition to heritable factors, environmental influences such as stress also significantly contribute to the development of MDD, both independently and in conjunction with genetic factors.<sup><a href=""#CR26"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR26"">26</a></sup> Numerous studies have suggested that adverse life events can lead to the development of MDD.<sup><a href=""#CR18"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR18"">18</a></sup> A major depressive episode always follows a traumatic or stressful life event. In particular, severe events such as job loss, extramarital affairs and divorce are known to provoke the onset of the disease.<sup><a href=""#CR36"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR36"">36</a></sup> The exact pathological mechanism by which social stress results in the development of MDD is still not known, mainly due to the difficulty of separating social factors from genetic factors in patients and the impracticality of exposing disease model animals to relevant environmental factors. It has been proved that the changes in the structure and function of neurons may occur under the chronic stress and lead to the occurrence of MDD.<sup><a href=""#CR37"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR37"">37</a>,<a href=""#CR38"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR38"">38</a></sup> In some MDD patients, stress leads to long-term elevated glucocorticoids, resulting in synaptic structural changes and remodeling, and the stress-induced hyperactivity of the HPA axis leads to negative feedback imbalance of the HPA axis, which is also related to depression.<sup><a href=""#CR39"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR39"">39</a></sup> Studies on damage to microglia and astrocytes suggest the significance of glial cells in the development of environmental factor-induced depression-like behaviors in mice.<sup><a href=""#CR40"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR40"">40</a></sup> In addition, our previous studies proved that chronic environmental stress-induced depressive-like behaviors in mice can be dependent on purinergic ligand-gated ion channel 7 receptor (P2X<sub>7</sub>R) activation in astrocytes.<sup><a href=""#CR41"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR41"">41</a></sup></p>"
"<p id=""Par10"">The existence of various physiological and psychological comorbidities in patients with depression reveals a clear link between physical and mental health, which has given us a better understanding of MDD. The presence of MDD is a risk factor for a variety of complications, including neurodegenerative diseases (such as dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease), cardiovascular diseases (such as ischemic coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction), metabolic and endocrine diseases (such as obesity in females and diabetes in males), and some autoimmune diseases.<sup><a href=""#CR42"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR42"">42</a>,<a href=""#CR43"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR43"">43</a></sup> The relationship between the onset of MDD and several diseases is complex and potentially bidirectional in nature.<sup><a href=""#CR44"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR44"">44</a></sup> The impact of depression on society and the economy is increased by the existence of comorbidities.<sup><a href=""#CR45"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR45"">45</a></sup> Specifically, in 2018, comorbid disorders rather than MDD itself were responsible for 63% of all costs related to MDD in the United States.<sup><a href=""#CR46"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR46"">46</a>,<a href=""#CR47"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR47"">47</a></sup> Furthermore, compared to people without depression, patients with MDD have been demonstrated to have a shorter life expectancy.<sup><a href=""#CR48"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR48"">48</a></sup> Additionally, the worsening of comorbidities could be a factor in the premature mortality of MDD patients.<sup><a href=""#CR44"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR44"">44</a></sup></p>"
"<p id=""Par11"">The traditional monoamine theory contends that in addition to common pathogenic factors, deficiencies in monoamine neurotransmitters, such as serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE), are the root cause of clinical depression.<sup><a href=""#CR49"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR49"">49</a></sup> Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), a class of antidepressants that have been proven to successfully treat clinical depression, were developed in response to this hypothesis, which was derived primarily on the basis of the pharmacological mechanism of drug that were accidentally discovered to act as antidepressants. It is also crucial to note that astrocytes express NE transporter (NETT) and 5-HT transporter (SERT), which are the targets of some traditional antidepressants.<sup><a href=""#CR50"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR50"">50</a></sup> A previous study suggested that the function of astrocytes can be directly regulated by SSRIs.<sup><a href=""#CR51"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR51"">51</a></sup> Monoamine oxidase (MAO) activates the metabolism of adrenaline and triggers calcium signaling in astrocytes,<sup><a href=""#CR52"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR52"">52</a></sup> which suggests that antidepressants may directly affect astrocytes by preventing them from reabsorbing monoamines.</p>"
"<p id=""Par12"">An essential neuromodulatory transmitter with specific neuroplastic properties is serotonin. Numerous investigations have demonstrated that 5-HT is intimately related to the pathophysiological process of major depression. The 5-HT hypothesis primarily asserts that a decrease in the 5-HT level is a risk factor for depression.<sup><a href=""#CR53"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR53"">53</a></sup> In addition, low levels of 5-HT and L-tryptophan, which is a precursor of 5-HT,<sup><a href=""#CR54"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR54"">54</a></sup> in blood platelets are also found in depressed people. Additionally, long-term treatment with fluoxetine, a typical SSRIs, reverses the stress-induced reduction in the quantity of astrocytic cells in the hippocampus in a tree shrew model of depression.<sup><a href=""#CR55"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR55"">55</a></sup></p>"
"<p id=""Par13"">5-HT receptors, which are mostly found on the bodies and dendrites of neurons, play a role in the pathogenesis of MDD.<sup><a href=""#CR56"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR56"">56</a></sup> To date, 5-HT receptor subfamilies comprising 14 different receptor subunits expressed in various brain regions, namely, 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1B</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1D</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1E</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1F</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2B</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>, 5-HT<sub>3</sub>, 5-HT<sub>4</sub>, 5-HT<sub>5A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>5B</sub>, 5-HT<sub>6</sub> and 5-HT<sub>7</sub>, have been reported. Among these 5-HT receptor subtypes, the 5-HT<sub>1</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2</sub>, 5-HT<sub>6</sub>, and 5-HT<sub>7</sub> subtypes are expressed on brain and spinal astrocytes in humans and rodents. Numerous 5-HT receptors expressed on astrocytes are G-coupled proteins that are associated with changes in the concentration of free cytosolic calcium ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>). These changes may trigger the release of a variety of astrocyte-derived signaling modulators, which may control neuronal activity.<sup><a href=""#CR57"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR57"">57</a></sup> In astrocytes, 5-HT has a strong effect on the 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptor.<sup><a href=""#CR58"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR58"">58</a></sup> 5-HT receptors have been extensively studied to determine the pharmacological mechanism of antidepressants, and many novel pharmaceutical preparations are being investigated. For example, some novel antidepressants function as agonists of the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2B</sub>, or 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor or antagonists of the 5-HT<sub>1B</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>, 5-HT<sub>3</sub>, 5-HT<sub>6</sub>, or 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor.<sup><a href=""#CR59"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR59"">59</a></sup></p>"
"<p id=""Par14"">Administration of fluoxetine in different concentrations to astrocytes expressing the 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptor may activate distinct signaling pathways to control gene expression. Fluoxetine reduces the mRNA expression of c-Fos through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway after acute application at concentrations below 1 μM, while the treatments with the higher doses (above 5 μM), it increases the gene expression of c-Fos via the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway in astrocytes.<sup><a href=""#CR60"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR60"">60</a></sup> Then, in the nucleus, the altered transcription factor c-Fos can further biphasic change the expression of caveoline under the chronic treatments, thus the alteration levels of caveoline on cellular membrane can finally affect the downstream activation of PTEN/PI3K/AKT/GSK3β<sup>60</sup>. The GSK3β polymorphisms are associated with the high risk of MDD in Chinese Han Population.<sup><a href=""#CR61"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR61"">61</a></sup> In our recent reports, the activation of GSK3β is also increased in the sorted astrocytes from the MDD-related stress-treated mice model and MDD clinic patients’ plasma.<sup><a href=""#CR62"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR62"">62</a></sup> In addition, after fluoxetine-mediated stimulation of the 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptor in astrocytes, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is transactivated and subsequently activates the MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT signaling cascades, which control the expression of mRNA or proteins that may be linked to mood disorders, such as SERT. Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent phospholipase A2 (cPLA<sub>2</sub>), adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 2 (ADAR2), and kainate receptor subtype 2 (GluK2) are all involved in kainate receptor signaling.<sup><a href=""#CR63"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR63"">63</a>,<a href=""#CR64"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR64"">64</a></sup> These discoveries promise astrocytic 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptors can be the potential pharmacological target of SSRIs (Fig. <a href=""#Fig2"" class=""usa-link"">2</a>).</p>"

"<p>Schematic illustration of the pharmacological mechanism of fluoxetine in astrocytes. Acute treatment with fluoxetine at low concentrations (green arrows) stimulates Src, which phosphorylates EGF receptors by activating 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptors (5-HT<sub>2B</sub>R) and activates the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. AKT phosphorylation induced by fluoxetine at low concentrations inhibits the expression of cFos and subsequently decreases the expression of caveolin-1 expression (chronic effects), which in turn decreases the membrane content of PTEN, induces phosphorylation and stimulation of PI3K and increases the phosphorylation of GSK3β, thus suppressing its activity. At higher concentrations, fluoxetine (red arrows) stimulates metalloproteinases (MMP) by activating 5-HT<sub>2B</sub>R and induces the release of growth factors, which stimulates EGF receptors and activates the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK)/ERK<sub>1/2</sub> signaling pathway. ERK<sub>1/2</sub> phosphorylation induced by fluoxetine at high concentrations stimulates the expression of cFos and subsequently increases the expression of caveolin-1 (chronic effects), which inhibits PTEN/PI3K/AKT/GSK3β,<sup><a href=""#CR60"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR60"">60</a></sup> ultimately leading to MDD like behavior. At high concentration, fluoxetine can also stimulate the activation of cPLA<sub>2a</sub> by the transactivation of EGFR/MAPK/ERK<sub>1/2</sub> pathway, and the activated ERK<sub>1/2</sub> can also increases the expression of cPLA<sub>2a</sub> at chronic treatments.<sup><a href=""#CR61"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR61"">61</a></sup> In addition, the increased expression of cFos induced by fluoxetine can further increases the RNA editing of GluK2 by increasing the expression of ADAR2 at the chronic treatments, the function of the edited GluK2 by fluoxetine is down-regulated, which causes the acute glutamated induced Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent ERK phosphorylation is suppressed.<sup><a href=""#CR63"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR63"">63</a></sup> Adobe Illustrator was used to generate this figure</p>"
"<p id=""Par15"">NE released by the locus coeruleus (LC) can participate in regulating various neural functions, such as smell, movement, and sensation.<sup><a href=""#CR65"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR65"">65</a></sup> It is significant to note that after being released, noradrenaline (NA) is not restricted to the area around the synaptic cleft and can reach nearby glial cells.<sup><a href=""#CR66"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR66"">66</a></sup> Atomoxetine is a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (NRI) clinically used for the treatment of MDD. After systemic inflammatory attack with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), atomoxetine can decrease neuroinflammation in the rat cerebral cortex.<sup><a href=""#CR67"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR67"">67</a></sup></p>"
"<p id=""Par16"">The bioavailability of 5-HT and NE are increased by antidepressants called serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), which belong to antidepressants. Currently, new SNRIs, including duloxetine (DXT),<sup><a href=""#CR68"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR68"">68</a></sup> desvenlafaxine (DVS),<sup><a href=""#CR69"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR69"">69</a></sup> and venlafaxine,<sup><a href=""#CR70"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR70"">70</a></sup> are widely used in MDD patients resistant to other treatments. Chronic treatment with DXT increases the expression of connexin 43 (Cx43), a crucial component of astrocyte gap junctions, in the rat PFC, preventing chronic unpredictable stress-induced dysfunction of astrocyte gap junctions and reversing the depressive-like behaviors caused by gap junction inhibition.<sup><a href=""#CR71"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR71"">71</a></sup> A novel therapeutic target for MDD is transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1), the expression of which is controlled by antidepressants. Venlafaxine has also been found to exert neuroprotection by boosting the production of type 2 fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) and transforming growth factor 1 TGF-β1 in astrocytes following stroke.<sup><a href=""#CR72"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR72"">72</a></sup> However, the expression of protein markers of astrocytes and neurons is unaffected by DVS, and the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced reduction in the levels of myelin- and oligodendrocyte-related proteins can be prevented by DVS.<sup><a href=""#CR69"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR69"">69</a></sup> DVS may reduce oligodendrocyte dysfunction in the CUMS mouse model by altering cholesterol production and reducing depression-like phenotypes.<sup><a href=""#CR69"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR69"">69</a></sup></p>"
"<p id=""Par17"">There is increasing evidence that people with depression have reduced dopamine neurotransmission.<sup><a href=""#CR73"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR73"">73</a></sup> Astrocytes in the lateral habeula are involved in regulating depressive-like behavior,<sup><a href=""#CR74"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR74"">74</a></sup> whereas the reward circuit is mediated by the striatum.<sup><a href=""#CR75"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR75"">75</a></sup> The dorsolateral part of the striatum is linked to the drug-seeking behavior and drug addiction associated with psychiatric disorders. As the major input to the basal ganglia, the striatum and related nuclei are linked to psychiatric morbidity, while the chronic stress reduces dopamine levels in areas such as the striatum and hippocampus.<sup><a href=""#CR76"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR76"">76</a></sup> Due to processes involving dopamine D2 receptor signaling,<sup><a href=""#CR77"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR77"">77</a></sup> the glutamine level increases in the presence of dopaminergic lesions and decreases in the presence of a high DA level.<sup><a href=""#CR78"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR78"">78</a></sup> DA signaling is considered to play a key role in astrocyte-neuron crosstalk in the striatum.<sup><a href=""#CR79"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR79"">79</a></sup> Sulpiride is an antidepressant that blocks the ability of the GLT-1 inhibitor TFB-TBOA to induce synaptic depression<sup><a href=""#CR80"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR80"">80</a></sup> and partly attenuates the impact of fluorocitrate (a metabolic uncoupler that blocks aconitase in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle) on synaptic output. According to these results, astrocyte dysfunction results in an increase in DA levels, which decreases neuronal activity resulting from the binding of DA to dopamine D2 receptors,<sup><a href=""#CR80"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR80"">80</a></sup> which generates neuronal depolarization, reducing DA selectivity at dopamine D1-like receptors and promoting DA inhibition through dopamine D2 receptors, which may contribute to increasing extracellular glutamate levels.<sup><a href=""#CR81"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR81"">81</a></sup> An increase in DA signaling brought on by compromised astrocyte activity may induce a long-lasting change in striatal neurotransmission<sup><a href=""#CR80"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR80"">80</a></sup> since DA signaling is crucial for both structural and synaptic plasticity.<sup><a href=""#CR82"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR82"">82</a></sup></p>"
"<p id=""Par18"">Glutamate is the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (CNS)<sup><a href=""#CR83"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR83"">83</a></sup> and can be released by neurons through exocytosis, which in turn activates extracellular N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (eNMDARs) in neurons, leading to synaptic loss.<sup><a href=""#CR84"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR84"">84</a></sup> Exosynaptic glutamate also contributes to metabolism in neurons and astrocytes. When exosynaptic glutamate is taken up by astrocytes, it can become a substrate for glutamine synthesis or be metabolized by astrocytes and neurons.<sup><a href=""#CR85"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR85"">85</a></sup> In addition, extracellular glutamate can also promote glucose uptake by astrocytes and inhibit glucose uptake by neurons. Therefore, glutamate is an important signal that mediates the interaction between central neurons and astrocytes, and its normal release and transport are the result of the functional cooperation between neurons and astrocytes. Glutamate homeostasis and neurotransmission play a major role in the onset of depression and anxiety. Studies have shown that glutamate levels in frontal cortex samples from autopsied patients with severe depression are increased, and antidepressants can restore normal glutamate levels.<sup><a href=""#CR86"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR86"">86</a></sup> It has been observed in animal models that sustained glucocorticoid stimulation can increase the excitability of glutamatergic neurons and simultaneously decrease the number and plasticity of astrocytes, in addition to decreasing neuronal dendrite connectivity in the hippocampus and frontal cortex, leading to depression.<sup><a href=""#CR87"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR87"">87</a></sup></p>"
"<p id=""Par19"">It is well-documented that astrocytes have a wide range of modulatory functions that may either increase or decrease the release of many different neurotransmitters. Specifically, astrocytes are essential regulators of glutamatergic neurotransmission, and reuptake of glutamate by astrocytes regulates excitatory synaptic activity.<sup><a href=""#CR85"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR85"">85</a></sup> When a large amount of glutamate is released from neuronal vesicles, glutamate clearance is mainly achieved by glutamate transporters (EAATs) on the membrane of astrocytes, which transport excess glutamate into astrocytes, where it is converted to glutamylamine through the action of glutamine synthase, reducing damage to neurons.<sup><a href=""#CR88"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR88"">88</a>,<a href=""#CR89"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR89"">89</a></sup> In the classic glutamate-glutamine cycle, astrocytes and neurons convert glutamate to the nonexcitatory amino acid glutamine, which is then released back into the extracellular space and absorbed by neurons.

Studies have shown that the main factor contributing to the elevation of hypothalamic-pituitary activity is the increased production of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). In addition, pituitary adrenal corticotropic hormone (ACTH) is released in response to CRH, which in turn triggers the adrenal cortex to release glucocorticoids (GCs).</p>"
"<p id=""Par24"">The HPA axis, a component of the neuroendocrine system, is commonly associated with the stress response. Hyperactivity of the HPA axis is thought to be an important pathophysiological mechanism underlying depression. High HPA activity is among the most typical neurobiological alterations in depressed individuals. The HPA axis is the primary stress response system that produces GCs, which are a class of steroid hormones. There is evidence that GCs, which are released in response to stress, are harmful to neurons in various brain regions. The hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) rapidly secretes CRH and arginine vasopressin (AVP)<sup><a href=""#CR107"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR107"">107</a></sup> when the HPA axis is activated by stress. The anterior pituitary is stimulated by CRH and AVP to produce ACTH, which in turn increases the release of GCs into the bloodstream.<sup><a href=""#CR108"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR108"">108</a></sup></p>"
"<p id=""Par25"">The GC and mineralocorticoid (MC) receptors GR and MR are members of the nuclear receptor (NR) superfamily. Both NRs can be triggered by binding to either MCs (such as aldosterone) or GCs (such as cortisol).

"<p id=""Par26"">To prevent loss of control over the HPA axis, GCs exert negative feedback on the axis in all regions involved (the limbic system, hypothalamus, and pituitary). Some data suggest that HPA axis imbalance and high levels of GCs play a core role in the pathogenesis of MDD and suggest that GR may serve as an important target for treating depression.<sup><a href=""#CR111"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR111"">111</a></sup></p>"
"<p id=""Par27"">Thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) are the two primary Thyroid hormones (THs) that regulate metabolism, protein synthesis, the growth of bones, and nervous system development. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), which regulates the synthesis of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) by the anterior pituitary gland, is mostly produced by neurons in the PVN. TSH stimulates the thyroid gland to produce T3 and T4. The levels of serum-free T4 and free T3 are regulated by negative feedback from pituitary TSH release. Tissue deiodinase mostly transforms T4 into the less physiologically active metabolite reverse T3 and the more biologically active metabolite T4.<sup><a href=""#CR112"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR112"">112</a></sup></p>"
"<p id=""Par28"">Overactivity of the HPA axis may be caused by damaged astrocytes and aberrant GR function. The HPA and hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axes are inextricably linked. The most important related finding is that cortisol directly affects TRH secretion (which regulates TSH release), potentially through the response of GCs to TRH mRNA expression in neurons. According to research, hypercortisolemia may result in a reduction in TRH mRNA levels in the mid-caudal PVN.<sup><a href=""#CR113"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR113"">113</a></sup> TRH expression in the PVN is lower in nonpsychiatric patients treated with corticosteroids, and the mRNA levels of TRH are lower in the PVN of depressed patients who have recurrent suicidal thoughts.

"<p id=""Par35"">Oxidative stress (OS), which is caused by an imbalance between antioxidants and reactive oxygen species (ROS), can harm proteins, lipids, or DNA. The activity of monoamine oxidase, the enzymes that break down monoamines such as DA, 5-HT and NE, is influenced by ROS and in turn can increase ROS production in mitochondria. The brain is more vulnerable to OS than other organs.

"<p id=""Par36"">Thioredoxin reductase, heme-oxygenase 1, glutathione, and glutathione peroxidase are only a few of the ROS-detoxifying enzymes that are abundant in astrocytes.<sup><a href=""#CR135"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR135"">135</a></sup> Astrocytes are the major producers of glutathione in the brain because they express a system xc-cyttine/glutamate antiporter, which does not exist in neurons; hence, neurons cannot synthesize glutathione.

"<p id=""Par66"">In summary, as shown in Fig. <a href=""#Fig4"" class=""usa-link"">4</a>, although the etiology of MDD is still unclear, it is widely accepted that the common pathogenic factors of MDD are genetic, stress, and comorbidity.<sup><a href=""#CR3"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR3"">3</a></sup> The levels of monoamine neurotransmitters (5-HT, NE, and DA) are insufficient in the synaptic cleft of MDD patients, correspondingly, the explored antidepressants such as tricyclic antidepressants(TCAs), SSRIs and SNRIs almostly act on the channels responsible for inhibiting reuptake of these neurotransmitters.<sup><a href=""#CR51"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR51"">51</a></sup> Thus, according to these traditional pharmacological theories, these antidepressants always have the delayed clinical efficacy, this promises the potential new pharmacological mechanism still requires further study. As the well-known glutamate-glutamine cycle, astrocytes play key roles in resolving neuronal glutamate toxicity. However, under the MDD pathological condition, due to the decreased expression of EAATs in astrocytes, excessive glutamate in the synaptic cleft activates synaptic mGluRs, which leads to neuronal excitotoxicity.<sup><a href=""#CR194"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR194"">194</a></sup> In addition, the overdose glutamate can also be decarboxylated by glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) to GABA and activates the GABA receptors on the postsynaptic membranes.<sup><a href=""#CR206"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR206"">206</a></sup> In our previous studies, the expression of 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> is selectively decreased in the sorting astrocytes from MDD model mice.<sup><a href=""#CR64"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR64"">64</a></sup> The antidepressants SSRIs and leptin can increase the expression of the astrocytic 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptor.<sup><a href=""#CR147"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR147"">147</a></sup> Furthermore, OS plays a crucial role in the emergence of depression, including by elevating the levels of ROS and NO in the mitochondrion of astrocytes.<sup><a href=""#CR253"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR253"">253</a></sup> Proinflammatory signaling pathways are activated as a result of elevated OS, the mitochondrial dysfunction results in an increased generation of ROS and NO.<sup><a href=""#CR137"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR137"">137</a></sup> As well as, the pathogenesis of MDD are associated with the inflammatory-immune response, as shown by elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines, mainly IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6.<sup><a href=""#CR141"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR141"">141</a></sup> The expression of neural cell marker proteins in neural cells, including Cx30/43,<sup><a href=""#CR162"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR162"">162</a></sup> GFAP,<sup><a href=""#CR167"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR167"">167</a></sup> AQP4,<sup><a href=""#CR172"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR172"">172</a></sup> and S100B,<sup><a href=""#CR177"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR177"">177</a></sup> are all decreased under MDD pathological conditions. In brain, KYN is metabolized by microglia to the neurotoxic metabolite QUIN and by astrocytes to the beneficial metabolite kynurenic acid (KynA), thus, QUIN is increased and KynA is decreased in MDD patients’ brain.<sup><a href=""#CR141"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR141"">141</a>,<a href=""#CR254"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR254"">254</a>,<a href=""#CR255"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR255"">255</a></sup> Recently, growing evidence support that the occurrence of MDD are the results of the correlational disorders from multiple systems or organs, not only limiting in brain.<sup><a href=""#CR227"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR227"">227</a>,<a href=""#CR228"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR228"">228</a></sup> The comorbidities of MDD have attracted widespread attention, the intestinal gut microbial dysbiosis, liver dysfunction, immune system disorders all play important roles in the pathogenesis of MDD.

"<p>The pathogenesis of MDD is closely related to synapses, astrocytes, microglia, and their interactions as well as interactions among organ. Genetic factors, stress and comorbidities are considered the most common pathogenic factors of MDD<sup>3</sup>. The traditional monoamine theory contends that MDD may cause by the deficits in monoamine neurotransmitters.<sup><a href=""#CR49"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR49"">49</a></sup> Moreover, the other abnormal increase of neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft, such as glutamate, GABA and ATP, has the high relationship with the pathogenesis of MDD.<sup><a href=""#CR41"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR41"">41</a>,<a href=""#CR496"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR496"">496</a></sup> The interaction between neurons and glial cells can induce the oxidative stress, pro-inflammatory cytokines released, the reduction of neurotrophic factors.

"<p id=""Par67"">MDD is a prevalent psychiatric disorder worldwide and is expected to become one of top disease in terms of burden by 2030.<sup><a href=""#CR258"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR258"">258</a></sup> However, the current clinical diagnostic criteria for MDD are subjective, and diagnoses are mainly based on clinical symptoms, leading to high rates of missed and incorrect diagnoses. This section summarizes the newest research on diagnostic approaches for MDD, including serum indicators, neuroimaging indicators and multimodality scales. Research on new diagnostic approaches for MDD has the potential to improve our understanding of MDD pathogenesis and the accuracy of clinical diagnosis.</p>"
"<p id=""Par68"">The pathological mechanism of MDD can be studied in two ways: by exploring the pathophysiology of the disease and by identifying MDD-related neurobiological indicators4. Hence, identifying potential biomarkers for MDD could allow accurate diagnosis, faster treatment and effective monitoring of the disease. Recently, an increasing number of studies have confirmed the involvement of OS and neuroinflammation in MDD pathology.<sup><a href=""#CR259"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR259"">259</a>,<a href=""#CR260"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR260"">260</a></sup> Two novel biomarkers, serum nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase 1 (NOX1) and Raftlin, are reported to have good diagnostic value in MDD patients. The effectiveness of elevated NOX1 and Raftlin levels in diagnosing MDD has been evaluated in clinical trials; the related mechanism is that NOX1 can regulate the ROS-antioxidant balance in patients with MDD through OS and the inflammatory repsonse.<sup><a href=""#CR261"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR261"">261</a></sup> The serum level of the chemokine-like protein TAFA-5 (FAM19A5) has also been reported to be increased in patients with MDD, and increased serum FAM19A5 levels are associated with reactive astrogliosis, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration.<sup><a href=""#CR262"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR262"">262</a></sup> In addition, the level of serum FAM19A5 was shown to have a negative correlation with cortical thickness in specific brain regions. These findings suggest that serum FAM19A5 could be a potential biomarker for neurodegenerative changes in MDD.</p>"
"<p id=""Par69"">In addition to serum indicators, neuroimaging metrics are potential objective tools for improving the accuracy of MDD diagnosis and must be studied in death. In recent years, many researchers have tried to diagnose MDD using MRI by identifying disease-specific functional and/or structural abnormalities in patients with MDD compared with healthy subjects.<sup><a href=""#CR263"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR263"">263</a></sup> Structural MRI techniques, such as voxel-based morphometry (VBM), can be used to detect volume changes in gray matter.<sup><a href=""#CR264"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR264"">264</a></sup> It has been reported that abnormal gray matter volume (GMV) in several brain regions is positively correlated with MDD.<sup><a href=""#CR265"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR265"">265</a>,<a href=""#CR266"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR266"">266</a></sup> Regarding functional MRI, recent studies have revealed that cerebral functional abnormalities are not limited to specific brain regions in patients with MDD. These differences are also associated with hypoconnectivity within the frontoparietal network (FN), the DMN, and midline cortical regions.<sup><a href=""#CR267"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR267"">267</a>,<a href=""#CR268"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR268"">268</a></sup> Furthermore, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI) is an emerging neuroimaging technique used to study functional connectivity in the brain and holds great potential in aiding clinical diagnosis.<sup><a href=""#CR269"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR269"">269</a></sup> It has the benefits of being noninvasive and easy to perform and offering high temporal and spatial resolution.<sup><a href=""#CR270"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR270"">270</a></sup> As a result, it has played a significant role in MDD research and is a superior technique for researching MDD pathogenesis and identifying neuroimaging markers for MDD.<sup><a href=""#CR271"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR271"">271</a></sup> Thus, indicators such as amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF), fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF), regional homogeneity and functional connectivity (FC) have shown promise as neuroimaging markers for MDD. Recently, a study reported that increased average values of ALFF and fALFF in the right caudate and corpus callosum may serve as potential markers for diagnosing MDD.<sup><a href=""#CR272"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR272"">272</a></sup> Another study based on the largest R-fMRI database of MDD patients confirmed that the DMN plays a crucial role in MDD diagnosis, as DMN FC is reduced in patients with recurrent MDD.<sup><a href=""#CR273"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR273"">273</a></sup> These findings also suggest that the DMN should continue to be a prominent focus of MDD research.</p>"
"<p id=""Par70"">Given that structural and functional abnormalities are associated with MDD,<sup><a href=""#CR274"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR274"">274</a></sup> using multimodal approaches is more appropriate than relying on a single feature for the diagnosis of MDD. However, research results related to the effectiveness of neuroimaging techniques in diagnosing MDD remain inconsistent.<sup><a href=""#CR275"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR275"">275</a></sup> This may be attributed to variations in the types of structural and functional features examined; however, more importantly, very few studies have used multimodal approaches to diagnose MDD.<sup><a href=""#CR276"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR276"">276</a></sup> Recently, in a study utilizing multimodal MRI data, patients with MDD were successfully distinguished from healthy controls by radiomics analysis.<sup><a href=""#CR276"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR276"">276</a></sup> Radiomics is a rapidly developing field involving the extraction of quantitative information from diagnostic images, and it can be mainly divided into three steps: image acquisition, analysis and model building.<sup><a href=""#CR277"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR277"">277</a></sup> Additionally, omics and neuroimaging techniques can be combined to construct models for diagnosing MDD; specifically, 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1 A/1B methylation data can be integrated with resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) data. It was shown that this combination could be used to more accurately distinguish patients with MDD from healthy subjects than R-fMRI data or DNA methylation data alone.<sup><a href=""#CR278"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR278"">278</a></sup></p>"
"<p id=""Par71"">By now, the widely accepted objective diagnostic indicators or methods for MDD are still deficient. In addition to the unclear pathogenesis of MDD, insufficient sensitivity and accuracy of detection instruments are also the main reasons, especially the correlation between imaging characterization and disease-specific changes that need to be discussed.</p>"
"<p id=""Par72"">MDD is a disease with a high prevalence worldwide,<sup><a href=""#CR279"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR279"">279</a></sup> and preventing its occurrence and recurrence is crucial. Lifestyle medicine is an evolving medical specialty that aims to prevent chronic, noncommunicable diseases through lifestyle interventions. The goal of lifestyle medicine is to prevent the occurrence and recurrence of disease by improving sleep hygiene and diet, increasing physical exercise, avoiding sedentary behavior, increasing social support, and improving mood. In recent years, an increasing number of studies have demonstrated that the occurrence and recurrence of MDD can be prevented by means of lifestyle medicine;<sup><a href=""#CR280"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR280"">280</a></sup> we summarize these reports in this section.</p>"
"<p id=""Par73"">Improving sleep is an important strategy to prevent the occurrence of depression. Insomnia is included in the diagnostic criteria for MDD.<sup><a href=""#CR281"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR281"">281</a></sup> However, few studies have examined whether treating insomnia can prevent the exacerbation of depressive symptoms. Treating insomnia can prevent the worsening of depressive symptoms, and cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is a recommended intervention for treating insomnia to improve sleep and mood.<sup><a href=""#CR282"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR282"">282</a>–<a href=""#CR284"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR284"">284</a></sup> As a first-line treatment for insomnia, CBT-I includes cognitive therapy, stimulus management, sleep restriction, improved sleep hygiene, and relaxation.<sup><a href=""#CR282"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR282"">282</a>,<a href=""#CR285"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR285"">285</a></sup> CBT-I can also lead to sustained remission of insomnia-related disorders, and continuous treatment of insomnia with CBT-I can also reduce the occurrence and recurrence of MDD.<sup><a href=""#CR286"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR286"">286</a></sup> Circadian rhythm support (CRS) can strengthen the circadian rhythm by means of scheduled bright light exposure, physical activity, and body warming.<sup><a href=""#CR287"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR287"">287</a></sup> Although CRS has been reported to have only an indirect effect in alleviating sleep disturbance and depressive symptoms,<sup><a href=""#CR288"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR288"">288</a></sup> treatment with CRS may help maintain the beneficial effects of CBT-I.<sup><a href=""#CR288"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR288"">288</a>,<a href=""#CR289"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR289"">289</a></sup> In one study, 44% of untreated patients but 38%, 28% and 9% of patients treated with CRS, CBT-I, and CBT-I + CRS, respectively, experienced clinically significant worsening of depressive symptoms during a 1-year follow-up period. Between-group comparisons showed that the percentage of patients who experienced worsening of depressive symptoms was significantly different between the CBT-I + CRS group and the nontreated and CRS groups.<sup><a href=""#CR289"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR289"">289</a></sup> In a randomized controlled trial, exacerbation of depressive symptoms over one year was decreased in insomia patients with an increased risk of depression and insomnia patients treated by therapist-guided CBT-I combined with CRS; however, untreated insomnia patients with a high risk of depression experienced clinically significant worsening of depressive symptoms.<sup><a href=""#CR288"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR288"">288</a>,<a href=""#CR289"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR289"">289</a></sup></p>"
"<p id=""Par74"">Disrupted sleep is a common symptom of depressive episodes and increases the risk of MDD,<sup><a href=""#CR290"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR290"">290</a></sup> but the correlation between the onset of sleep disturbance and MDD is still unclear. Additionally, patients with symptoms of sleep disturbance have a greater risk of MDD occurrence and recurrence.<sup><a href=""#CR290"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR290"">290</a>,<a href=""#CR291"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR291"">291</a></sup> One study suggests that disrupted sleep may affect monoamine function and the HPA axis,<sup><a href=""#CR292"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR292"">292</a></sup> even causing hyperarousal and inflammation.<sup><a href=""#CR293"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR293"">293</a></sup> Additional studies on the pathological mechanism of depression have suggested that the HPA axis is hyperactive in MDD patients and that sensitivity to negative feedback is decreased.<sup><a href=""#CR15"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR15"">15</a></sup> Additionally, one prospective cohort study reported that a history of sleep disorders can increase the risk of depression later in life and that subjective sleep problems are associated with clinically significant depressive symptoms.<sup><a href=""#CR294"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR294"">294</a></sup></p>"
"<p id=""Par75"">Dietary adjustment is an effective, safe, and widely applicable method for preventing MDD, especially by inhibiting MDD-related pathological inflammation.<sup><a href=""#CR295"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR295"">295</a></sup> Various nutrients can possess different anti-inflammatory properties; in contrast, there are many proinflammatory foods, such as those high in refined starch, sugar, and saturated fat and low in fiber and omega-3 fatty acids,<sup><a href=""#CR296"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR296"">296</a></sup> which can promote the occurrence of inflammation to increase the risk of MDD.<sup><a href=""#CR297"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR297"">297</a></sup> One study reported that the chance of being diagnosed with depression is higher among individuals who consume a proinflammtory diet than among those who consume an anti-inflammatory diet.<sup><a href=""#CR295"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR295"">295</a></sup> Stimulation of the innate immune system by proinflammatory foods can result in mild inflammation and chronic illness, which may contribute to an increased risk of MDD.<sup><a href=""#CR298"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR298"">298</a></sup> Furthermore, an increasing number of studies suggest that at the molecular and cellular levels, dietary factors have effects on neuronal function and synaptic plasticity, which may be implicated in the etiology of MDD.<sup><a href=""#CR299"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR299"">299</a>,<a href=""#CR300"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR300"">300</a></sup> Therefore, adherence to a healthier diet can reduce the incidence of MDD, which is of great significance for the clinical treatment and prevention of depression.<sup><a href=""#CR295"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR295"">295</a></sup></p>"
"<p id=""Par76"">In addition, an increasing number of studies have identified the importance of the interaction among the microbiota, gut permeability, and immune-inflammatory processes in the pathophysiology of MDD.<sup><a href=""#CR301"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR301"">301</a></sup> Because the interaction of bacteria of some taxa in the gut with peripheral inflammation with the brain may be related to depression pathophysiology,<sup><a href=""#CR302"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR302"">302</a>,<a href=""#CR303"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR303"">303</a></sup> regulating the gut-microbe-brain axis may be a therapeutic and preventive strategy for psychiatric disorders.<sup><a href=""#CR304"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR304"">304</a></sup> Restoration of the gut eubiosis can prevent the occurrence of MDD, and probiotics can normalize the gut ecosystem. Additionally, by altering the microbiota and regulating gut permeability, a gluten-free diet can alter the activity of the gut-microbe-brain axis, which has been discovered to be related to the pathogenesis of MDD.<sup><a href=""#CR305"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR305"">305</a>–<a href=""#CR307"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR307"">307</a></sup> Other studies report that consuming a gluten-free diet and probiotic supplements together may inhibit the immune-inflammatory cascade in MDD patients, and decreased inflammation can improve the integrity of the gut barrier and alleviate depressive symptoms.<sup><a href=""#CR307"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR307"">307</a></sup> Similarly, dietary fiber can also improve immune function by regulating the gut microbiota to prevent the occurrence of MDD,<sup><a href=""#CR308"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR308"">308</a></sup> which is attributed to the inhibition of OS and inflammation.</p>"
"<p id=""Par77"">Increasing evidence suggests that physical exercise can prevent some mental disorders in addition to cardiovascular disease.<sup><a href=""#CR280"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR280"">280</a>,<a href=""#CR309"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR309"">309</a></sup> This finding suggests that physical exercise may be able to prevent MDD. As reported in some studies, physical exercise can effectively prevent depression by affecting many molecular and cellular pathways; for instance, physical exercise can stimulate VEGF expression,<sup><a href=""#CR310"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR310"">310</a>,<a href=""#CR311"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR311"">311</a></sup> leading to cellular level changes, such as stimulation of angiogenesis, increased delivery of neurotrophic factors and oxygen by the vascular system,<sup><a href=""#CR312"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR312"">312</a></sup> an increase in the neurogenesis rate and induction of synaptogenesis.<sup><a href=""#CR312"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR312"">312</a>,<a href=""#CR313"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR313"">313</a></sup> Ultimately, VEGF improves function in the hippocampus, which is one of the brain regions related to depression and stress regulation.<sup><a href=""#CR314"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR314"">314</a>–<a href=""#CR316"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR316"">316</a></sup> Exercise also reduces the levels of proinflammatory factors (e.g., IL-6) and increases the levels of anti-inflammatory factors (e.g., IL-10), which is beneficial for preventing the occurrence of MDD.<sup><a href=""#CR317"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR317"">317</a>–<a href=""#CR319"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR319"">319</a></sup> Furthermore, physical exercise for approximately 45 minutes per day can significantly reduce the risk of MDD.<sup><a href=""#CR320"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR320"">320</a>,<a href=""#CR321"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR321"">321</a></sup> High-intensity activity, such as aerobic exercise, dancing, and the usage of exercise machines, and low-intensity exercises, including yoga and stretching, can all reduce the occurrence of MDD.<sup><a href=""#CR322"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR322"">322</a></sup> Specifically, the combination of aerobic exercise and stretching as a multimodal therapeutic strategies has a significant antidepressant effect in depressed inpatients.<sup><a href=""#CR323"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR323"">323</a></sup></p>"

"<p id=""Par83"">In the late 1950s, the first TCAs were approved and used for the treatment of depression.<sup><a href=""#CR342"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR342"">342</a></sup> TCAs have a common three-ring chemical structure, and the main TCAs are imipramine, amitriptyline, clomipramine, desipramine and doxepin. The pharmacological mechanism of TCAs mainly involves its interaction with neurotransmitters in the brain, resulting in changes in neurotransmitter levels and an antidepressant effect. First, TCAs can inhibit the reuptake of neurotransmitters, leading to antidepressant effects. For example, they can influence the levels of 5-HT, NE, and to a lesser degree, DA, causing an increase in neurotransmitter concentrations in the synaptic gap and increasing neurotransmitter signaling to exert pharmacological effects.<sup><a href=""#CR343"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR343"">343</a></sup> However, different TCAs inhibit 5-HT and NE reuptake to varying degrees. For instance, amitriptyline, imipramine, and desipramine strongly inhibit 5-HT reuptake,<sup><a href=""#CR344"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR344"">344</a></sup> clomipramine specifically inhibits NE reuptake, and nortriptyline can inhibit both NE and 5-HT reuptake while also exerting central anticholinergic effects.<sup><a href=""#CR345"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR345"">345</a>–<a href=""#CR347"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR347"">347</a></sup> Additionally, TCAs can antagonize 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>, thereby increasing the release of NE and DA in cortical areas.<sup><a href=""#CR348"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR348"">348</a>–<a href=""#CR350"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR350"">350</a></sup> TCAs can bind to histamine receptors, especially H1 receptors, as well.<sup><a href=""#CR351"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR351"">351</a></sup> By blocking H1 receptors, they can induce sedation and drowsiness, which may benefit depressed patients with sleep disorders.<sup><a href=""#CR352"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR352"">352</a></sup> Furthermore, TCAs can also block muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, exerting anticholinergic effects and resulting in side effects such as dry mouth and constipation.<sup><a href=""#CR353"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR353"">353</a></sup></p>"
"<p id=""Par84"">In addition to the above-known pharmacological mechanisms, some recent studies have reported that amitriptyline can induce the activation of fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR), leading to the production of GDNF.<sup><a href=""#CR354"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR354"">354</a></sup> In addition, amitriptyline can increase the expression of Cx43 to promote gap junction intercellular communication (GJIC) between astrocytes, thereby relieving depressive symptoms.<sup><a href=""#CR355"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR355"">355</a></sup> This suggests that TCAs may also ameliorate severe depression through additional mechanisms involving astrocytes that are independent of the monoamine system to some extent. Further exploration is needed to fully understand the specific mechanism. Another study demonstrated that FKBP51, a crucial modulator of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) pathway, can bind to clomipramine and impede its interaction with PIAS4. Inhibition of this interaction subsequently hinders sumoylation; this alteration represents a newly discovered mechanism by which the antidepressant drug exerts its effect.<sup><a href=""#CR356"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR356"">356</a></sup></p>"
"<p id=""Par85"">According to a study, most severe depression patients are still advised to consider SSRIs as the initial choice for treatment.<sup><a href=""#CR350"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR350"">350</a></sup> The main representative SSRIs drugs include fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine, and escitalopram. The mechanisms of action of SSRIs are commonly known as follows: first, SSRIs can selectively inhibit SERT, inhibiting the reuptake of 5-HT in the synaptic cleft and thereby exerting pharmacological effects.<sup><a href=""#CR357"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR357"">357</a></sup> Second, SSRIs can impact the 5-HT signaling pathway, activating 5-HT<sub>1A.</sub><sup><a href=""#CR358"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR358"">358</a>,<a href=""#CR359"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR359"">359</a></sup> In addition, studies have shown that antagonism of 5-HT<sub>2A/2C</sub> receptors can enhance the effects of SSRIs such as fluoxetine.<sup><a href=""#CR360"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR360"">360</a>,<a href=""#CR361"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR361"">361</a></sup> Third, long-term use of SSRIs can increase 5-HT transmission in the LC,<sup><a href=""#CR362"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR362"">362</a></sup> thereby increasing the release of GABA to exert inhibitory effects on NA neurons.<sup><a href=""#CR363"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR363"">363</a></sup> Fourth, long-term use of SSRIs is associated with neuroplasticity and neurogenesis in certain brain regions.<sup><a href=""#CR364"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR364"">364</a></sup> SSRIs have been found to increase the expression of BDNF, a protein crucial for neuronal growth and survival, by acting on TrkB,<sup><a href=""#CR365"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR365"">365</a></sup> which may contribute to the long-term therapeutic effects of SSRIs. Thus, our previous reports and others researches all suggested that astrocytic 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptors may be the potential pharmacological target of SSIRs.<sup><a href=""#CR59"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR59"">59</a>,<a href=""#CR60"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR60"">60</a>,<a href=""#CR366"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR366"">366</a>–<a href=""#CR368"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR368"">368</a></sup></p>"
"<p id=""Par86"">According to previous studies by our group, in the absence of SERT, SSRIs such as fluoxetine can act as direct agonists of astrocytic 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptors to exert antidepressant-like effects.<sup><a href=""#CR60"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR60"">60</a>,<a href=""#CR64"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR64"">64</a>,<a href=""#CR179"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR179"">179</a>,<a href=""#CR366"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR366"">366</a>,<a href=""#CR369"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR369"">369</a></sup> In astroglia isolated from mice exposed to CUMS, fluoxetine activates the 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptor, promoting ERK<sub>1/2</sub> phosphorylation. This increases downstream c-Fos expression, which in turn boosts BDNF synthesis.<sup><a href=""#CR147"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR147"">147</a></sup> Furthermore, administration of fluoxetine effectively inhibits SD-induced stimulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by the AKT/STAT3 and ERK/STAT3 pathways in vivo, and SD dramatically triggers depressive-like behaviors by stimulating astrocytic P2X<sub>7</sub>Rs.<sup><a href=""#CR41"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR41"">41</a>,<a href=""#CR155"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR155"">155</a></sup> As previously mentioned, leptin may increase the expression of the 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptor in astrocytes via the LepR/JAK2/STAT3 pathway, and fluoxetine may be more effective in increasing BDNF levels and alleviating depressive-like behaviors due to the leptin-mediated increase in 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptor expression.<sup><a href=""#CR130"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR130"">130</a></sup> Both in vivo and in vitro, fluoxetine’s inhibitory actions on A1 reactive astrocytes depend on astrocytic 5-HT<sub>2B</sub>R.<sup><a href=""#CR55"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR55"">55</a></sup> Recently, fluoxetine was shown to act as a 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> agonist, and this finding is also supported by research by other groups. Fluoxetine has been reported to suppress the activation of A1 reactive astrocytes and decrease unusual behaviors in CMS-exposed mice. In vitro, Gq protein and b-arrestin1 are not necessary for fluoxetine’s effects on A1 astrocyte activation, and downstream signaling through astrocytic 5-HT<sub>2B</sub>R is responsible for fluoxetine’s inhibitory effects on A1 astrocyte activation in primary culture.<sup><a href=""#CR55"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR55"">55</a></sup></p>"
"<p id=""Par87"">SNRIs are often recommended as the initial choice for the treatment of MDD. Representative SNRIs include milnacipran, DXT, DVS, and venlafaxine. The molecular mechanisms of SNRIs can be summarized as follows: First, SNRIs inhibit the norepinephrine transporter (NET), which prevents the reuptake of NE into presynaptic neurons, leading to an increased concentration of NE in the synaptic cleft.<sup><a href=""#CR370"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR370"">370</a></sup> Second, similar to SSRIs, SNRIs also inhibit SERT, resulting in an increased concentration of 5-HT in the synaptic cleft.<sup><a href=""#CR371"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR371"">371</a></sup> For example, paroxetine and venlafaxine can inhibit SERT and, to a lesser extent, NET.<sup><a href=""#CR372"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR372"">372</a></sup> Third, SNRIs inhibit the reuptake of both NE and 5-HT; thus, they have a dual mechanism of action. This dual inhibitory effect is believed to contribute to the broader therapeutic effects of SNRIs compared to SSRIs.<sup><a href=""#CR373"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR373"">373</a></sup> Chronic treatment with fluoxetine has been shown to increase the expression of Cx43 in the rat PFC, which further prevents the dysfunction of astrocytic gap junctions induced by CUS and reverses the depressive-like behaviors caused by gap junction blockade.<sup><a href=""#CR71"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR71"">71</a></sup></p>"
"<p id=""Par88"">In a randomized controlled trial, MRI scan were taken after treatment with duloxetine and desvenlafaxine, and the results showed that the thalamo-cortico-periaqueductal network, which is associated with the experience of pain, may be an important target of action of antidepressant drugs.<sup><a href=""#CR374"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR374"">374</a></sup></p>"
"<p id=""Par89"">The abovementioned antidepressants have been utilized as clinical therapies for MDD, but it is difficult to elucidate the exact pharmacological mechanisms of every medicine due to delayed clinical efficacy, poor treatment response to some patients, and difficulty in effectively controlling the incidence of suicide. Recently, several pharmacological agents have been discovered as potential antidepressants.</p>"
"<p id=""Par90"">Ketamine, a noncompetitive antagonist of the NMDAR, has been shown to induce rapid and significant antidepressant effects within a few hours.<sup><a href=""#CR375"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR375"">375</a></sup> Due to the rapid antidepressant effects of ketamine, unlike the delayed effects of traditional antidepressant drugs,<sup><a href=""#CR376"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR376"">376</a></sup> research on this drug has continued and has revealed its mechanisms of action and potential drug targets. Ketamine can increase the level of BDNF in the prefrontal cortex, especially in the hippocampus, to exert antidepressant-like effects.<sup><a href=""#CR377"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR377"">377</a></sup> Studies have suggested that ketamine can increase the synthesis of synaptic proteins through BDNF signaling dependent on the activate protein kinase B (Akt) and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling cascades.<sup><a href=""#CR378"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR378"">378</a>,<a href=""#CR379"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR379"">379</a></sup> Ketamine may induce the activation of mTOR by the upstream kinase Akt, regulate the phosphorylation of GSK-3β, and exert antidepressant effects.<sup><a href=""#CR380"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR380"">380</a></sup> Ketamine can block NMDARs in postsynaptic principal neurons in the PFC and hippocampus, increase synaptic function through homeostatic mechanisms, and reverse synaptic defects caused by chronic stress.<sup><a href=""#CR381"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR381"">381</a>,<a href=""#CR382"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR382"">382</a></sup> Furthermore, by inhibiting NMDARs, ketamine can reduce the excitation of specific cortical GABAergic interneurons, resulting in a temporary increase in glutamate release that stimulates postsynaptic AMPA glutamate receptors. This, in turn, leads to the release of BDNF, activation of the TrkB receptor, and subsequent activation of the Akt/mTORC1 signaling pathway. These molecular events ultimately contribute to an increase in the number and functionality of synapses, leading to amelioration of depressive symptoms.<sup><a href=""#CR383"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR383"">383</a></sup></p>"
"<p id=""Par91"">Similar as ketamine, some other psychedelics can also produce fast and persistent antidepressant effects.<sup><a href=""#CR384"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR384"">384</a></sup> Psilocybin, a classical psychedelic, can play its antidepressant roles by activating 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors (5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R).<sup><a href=""#CR385"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR385"">385</a></sup> Thus, to block the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R can not produce the antidepressant effects of psilocybin, only induce the hallucinogenic-like behaviors in mice.<sup><a href=""#CR386"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR386"">386</a></sup> This proposes 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R may not be the real pharmacological target for its antidepressant effects. Another study reports that the combination of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin may exert long-term antidepressant effects by promoting neural plasticity, which dose not involve in the hallucinogenic effects.<sup><a href=""#CR384"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR384"">384</a></sup> Additionally, to target 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R, the combination of LSD and psilocybin can lead to biased activation of the mediated signaling pathway and produce antidepressant effects without the side effects of hallucinations.<sup><a href=""#CR387"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR387"">387</a></sup> Thus, the administration of psilocybin can rapidly and persistently induce neuronal dendritic remodeling in the medial frontal cortex of mice, and the psilocybin-induced newly formed dendritic spines can successfully transform functional synapses, suggesting that synaptic rewiring may also be one pharmacological mechanism of the rapid antidepressant effects of psilocybin.<sup><a href=""#CR388"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR388"">388</a></sup> To further dissociate the hallucinogens effects from the psychedelics can be beneficial to develop more specific antidepressants with better therapeutic capacities.</p>"
"<p id=""Par92"">Additionally, some novel potential therapeutic targets for MDD have also been reported, such as TGF-β1<sup><a href=""#CR389"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR389"">389</a></sup> and growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43).<sup><a href=""#CR390"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR390"">390</a></sup> Multiple studies have shown that antidepressants may cause changes in TGF-β1 expression. Fluoxetine, paroxetine, venlafaxine, and sertraline have been shown to have the potential to increase the levels of TGF-β1, which may contribute to their antidepressant effects.<sup><a href=""#CR391"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR391"">391</a>,<a href=""#CR392"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR392"">392</a></sup> Venlafaxine has also been reported to exert neuroprotection by increasing the production of FGF-2 and TGF-β1 in astrocytes following stroke.<sup><a href=""#CR72"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR72"">72</a></sup> Then, chronic administration of desipramine has been shown to upregulate the expression of GAP-43 in the hippocampus of rats, potentially influencing neuronal plasticity in the CNS.<sup><a href=""#CR390"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR390"">390</a></sup> GAP-43 has been suggested as a relevant target for the pharmacological effects of antidepressants.<sup><a href=""#CR393"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR393"">393</a>,<a href=""#CR394"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR394"">394</a></sup></p>"

"<p id=""Par117"">MDD is a heterogeneous disease, its pathological and pharmacological mechanisms are still unclear, and diagnostic and therapeutic methods for MDD are limited.

According to research on real-world sequential therapies, even after numerous treatment attempts, almost 30% of MDD patients do not experience remission. This suggests that the existing theories and hypotheses cannot completely explain the pathogenesis of MDD and that more research on the pharmacological mechanisms of currently available antidepressants is still needed. We mainly discussed the potential etiology and pathogenesis of MDD from the perspective of widely accepted theories, including the neurotransmitter and receptor hypothesis, HPA axis hypothesis, cytokine hypothesis, neuroplasticity hypothesis and systemic influence hypothesis. A more comprehensive understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of MDD might significantly improve our capacity to develop preventive and more effective therapeutic methods that can help reduce the burden of and pain caused by major depression.

"<p id=""Par118"">MDD is connected with several cellular and structural modifications in the nervous system. Nonetheless, in the majority of these alterations cannot be consistently observed in vivo. Therefore, several issues need to be considered in future research: (i) Studies of animal models have made important contributions to our understanding of the pathophysiology of major depression, and more representative animal models of MDD should be developed. (ii) Because of our incomplete understanding of the disease and the disease’s intrinsic intricacy, there is an urgent need to develop updated imaging technologies and imaging software to allow advances in our understanding of the disease. (iii) The therapeutic shortcomings of traditional antidepressants have prompted the need for further drug discovery and development.

"<p>Schizophrenia is a complex heterogenous disorder thought to be caused by interactions between genetic and environmental factors. The theories developed to explain the etiology of schizophrenia have focused largely on the dysfunction of neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin and glutamate with their receptors, although research in the past several decades has indicated strongly that other factors are also involved and that the role of neuroglial cells in psychotic disorders including schizophrenia should be given more attention. Although glia were originally thought to be present in the brain only to support neurons in a physical, metabolic and nutritional capacity, it has become apparent that these cells have a variety of important physiological roles and that abnormalities in their function may make significant contributions to the symptoms of schizophrenia. In the present paper, we review the interactions of brain microglia, astrocytes and oligodendroglia with aspects such as transmitter dysregulation, neuro-inflammation, oxidative stress, synaptic function, the gut microbiome, myelination and the blood–brain barrier that appear to affect the cause, development and treatment of schizophrenia. We also review crosstalk between microglia, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes and the effects of antipsychotics on neuroglia. Problems associated with studies on specific biomarkers for glia in schizophrenia are discussed.</p>"

[<a href=""#B212-biomolecules-15-00010"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B212-biomolecules-15-00010"">212</a>] found that quetiapine increased D-serine release, enhanced signaling related to the cellular regulators extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk), protein kinase B (PKB, also called Akt) and 5′-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and increased cyclic AMP synthesis. Using the MK-801 mouse model of schizophrenia, Yu et al. [<a href=""#B213-biomolecules-15-00010"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B213-biomolecules-15-00010"">213</a>] proposed that quetiapine may reduce oligodendrocyte apoptosis, promote oligodendrocyte-induced myelination through the modulation of PI3k/Akt signalling and thus reduce cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. However, it should be noted that it has also been reported that quetiapine does not reduce disease severity in a mouse model of autoimmune-mediated demyelination in the spinal cord [<a href=""#B214-biomolecules-15-00010"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B214-biomolecules-15-00010"">214</a>].

"<p>Interactions with glia can also account for some of the adverse effects observed with antipsychotics, particularly after chronic administration. Schmitz et al. [<a href=""#B221-biomolecules-15-00010"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B221-biomolecules-15-00010"">221</a>] have provided a comprehensive table on the effects of several typical and atypical antipsychotics on multiple actions of glia (e.g., inhibition of the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines; effects on the uptake or release of glutamate and D-serine; release of trophic factors; oxidative stress) and have described in detail how some of these effects may contribute to the therapeutic actions of these drugs and how some may, particularly in association with long-term use and aging, contribute to undesired side effects (Janus face). These authors have suggested that the co-administration of glioprotective agents such as resveratrol could attenuate some of the side effects of these drugs and reduce glial reactivity [<a href=""#B221-biomolecules-15-00010"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B221-biomolecules-15-00010"">221</a>]. Several antipsychotics have been reported in clinical and preclinical studies to cause brain volume loss and produce astrocyte death after chronic administration [review: 222]. In a recent study with a human astrocyte cell line (C1028), He et al. [<a href=""#B222-biomolecules-15-00010"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B222-biomolecules-15-00010"">222</a>] found that chronic treatment with the antipsychotics olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone and haloperidol induced the death of astrocytes and activated signaling modulated by the inflammasome sensor nod-like receptor protein3 (NLRP3) and caspase-1. These researchers reported that co-treatment with a histamine H1 receptor agonist reduced this activation and suggested that such drugs could be useful in the future development of strategies to inhibit the death of astrocytes caused by antipsychotics and to inform the development of new antipsychotics with reduced toxicity.</p>"
"<p>As can be seen from the above literature review, the etiology and pharmacotherapy of schizophrenia are very complex, with many facets beyond just the dysregulation of a small number of neurotransmitters involved. It is also now evident that neuroglia have many important roles in brain function above and beyond just providing physical and metabolic support for neurons, and that their dysfunction may be very pertinent to the etiology of schizophrenia. These relevant roles include possible involvement with synaptic development and function, inflammation, endocrine function, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, the BBB and the gut–brain axis. Several of the current antipsychotic drugs are now known to have effects on glia in addition to their effects on neurotransmitter receptors on neurons, and these actions may contribute to their therapeutic results as well as their side effects.</p>"
"<p>Research on glia has enhanced our understanding of the etiology of schizophrenia and the actions of currently available antipsychotics but has also emphasized how complex this disorder is. There are several impediments to doing future research on biomarkers and drug development for schizophrenia with regard to glia. As discussed in detail by Laricchiuta et al. [<a href=""#B59-biomolecules-15-00010"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B59-biomolecules-15-00010"">59</a>], there are conflicting results on the overactivation of microglia and astrocytes and the involvement of inflammation in schizophrenia in the literature. In recent years, there has been an increased use of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) or single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to study specific cell types in brain tissue from heathy controls and people with schizophrenia [<a href=""#B223-biomolecules-15-00010"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B223-biomolecules-15-00010"">223</a>,<a href=""#B224-biomolecules-15-00010"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B224-biomolecules-15-00010"">224</a>,<a href=""#B225-biomolecules-15-00010"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B225-biomolecules-15-00010"">225</a>,<a href=""#B226-biomolecules-15-00010"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B226-biomolecules-15-00010"">226</a>,<a href=""#B227-biomolecules-15-00010"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B227-biomolecules-15-00010"">227</a>], and the findings of several studies do not support the major involvement of glia in schizophrenia. Skene et al. [<a href=""#B223-biomolecules-15-00010"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B223-biomolecules-15-00010"">223</a>] studied whether the genomic loci proposed to be implicated in schizophrenia mapped onto specific cell types and reported consistent mapping to pyramidal cells, medium spiny neurons and certain interneurons but much less consistent mapping to embryonic, progenitor or glial cells. In a study on schizophrenia risk genes employing summary-data based Mendelian randomization based on single-cell sequencing data, Wu et al. [<a href=""#B225-biomolecules-15-00010"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B225-biomolecules-15-00010"">225</a>] identified 54 new risk genes associated with schizophrenia. These researchers reported that the highest expression of schizophrenia risk genes was in excitatory neurons and caudal ganglionic eminence interneurons. Ruzicka et al. [<a href=""#B226-biomolecules-15-00010"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B226-biomolecules-15-00010"">226</a>] used snRNA-seq to study postmortem PFC tissue from two cohorts of healthy people and people with schizophrenia and developed a single-cell resolution transcriptomic atlas of the PFC as well as characterizing the expression changes associated with schizophrenia. They included neuronal and glial cell types to investigate schizophrenia-dysregulated genes. Gene expression changes were observed in all detected cell types, but most changes occurred in neurons, with more than three-quarters of the changes occurring in excitatory neurons, with downregulation favoured. However, Thrupp et al. [<a href=""#B227-biomolecules-15-00010"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B227-biomolecules-15-00010"">227</a>] concluded that snRNA-seq is not suitably sensitive for detecting cellular activation in microglia in humans.</p>"
"<p>Several of the possible biomarkers related to glia in schizophrenia are also present in other neuropsychiatric disorders. In addition, many of the receptors expressed by glia are also expressed by neurons.

"<p id=""P3"">The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory — Trait version (STAI-T) was developed to measure an individual’s tendency to experience anxiety, but it may lack discriminant evidence of validity based on strong observed relationships with measures of depression. The present series of meta-analyses compares STAI-T scores among individuals with depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, and nonclinical comparison groups, as well as correlations with measures of anxiety and depressive symptom severity, in order to further examine discriminant and convergent validity. A total of 388 published studies (<em>N</em> = 31,021) were included in the analyses. Individuals with an anxiety disorder and those with a depressive disorder displayed significantly elevated scores on the STAI-T compared to nonclinical comparison groups. Furthermore, anxiety and depressive symptom severity were similarly strongly correlated with the STAI-T (mean <em>r</em> = .59 – .61). However, individuals with a depressive disorder had significantly <em>higher</em> STAI-T scores than individuals with an anxiety disorder (Hedges’s <em>g</em> = 0.27). Given these findings, along with previous factor analyses that have observed a depression factor on the STAI-T, describing the scale as a measure of ‘trait anxiety’ may be a misnomer. It is proposed that the STAI-T be considered a non-specific measure of negative affectivity rather than trait anxiety per se.</p>"

"<p id=""P4"">Trait anxiety is an individual’s tendency to appraise situations as threatening, avoid anxiety-provoking situations, and demonstrate high baseline physiological arousal (<a href=""#R54"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R54"">Elwood et al., 2012</a>). Early research identified trait anxiety as separate from, but likely contributing to, state anxiety (<a href=""#R34"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R34"">Cattell &amp; Scheier, 1958</a>; <a href=""#R35"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R35"">1961</a>; <a href=""#R143"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R143"">Spielberger, 1966</a>), and ongoing research suggests that trait anxiety is an important vulnerability factor for anxiety-related psychopathology (<a href=""#R3"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R3"">Andrews, 1991</a>; <a href=""#R57"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R57"">Eysenck, 1992</a>; <a href=""#R127"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R127"">Rachman, 1998</a>). The present review examines the cognitive, behavioral, physiological, and neural correlates of trait anxiety which may offer important insights into the mechanisms by which trait anxiety may increase vulnerability to the development and maintenance of anxiety-related psychopathology. Research evidence suggests that trait anxiety may also be associated with depression (<a href=""#R170"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R170"">Weger &amp; Sandi, 2018</a>), though the magnitude of this association is unclear.</p>"
"<p id=""P5"">Trait anxiety and related personality traits (negative affectivity, neuroticism, and dispositional negativity) have been extensively studied in the psychopathological literature. <a href=""#R11"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R11"">Barlow and colleagues (2014)</a> suggest that trait anxiety is synonymous with neuroticism. Given these close ties, they suggest that both anxiety and depressive disorders share similar etiology and should be considered jointly under the category of <em>emotional disorders</em>. Operational definitions of trait anxiety have also been informed by consideration of psychological and neurobiological processes in animals and humans that contribute to a propensity to experience more frequent, intense, and/or enduring negative affect (<em>dispositional negativity</em>). Shackman and colleagues (2016) suggest that stable, indiscriminate, elevated negative affect is the most relevant to the development of psychopathology. In this model, trait anxiety is described as one component of <em>anxious distress</em>, one of two lower-level dimensions of dispositional negativity. Although the construct of trait anxiety has been a major component of etiological modes of anxiety-related disorders, much remains unknown about its measurement and associated mechanisms. The present review contributes to this broader literature by critically examining the cognitive, behavioral, and biological correlates of trait anxiety and its role in anxiety and depression, with a focus on studies that use the most commonly used measure, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI; <a href=""#R145"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R145"">Spielberger et al., 1970</a>, <a href=""#R146"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R146"">1983</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P6"">Research on the cognitive mechanisms of trait anxiety suggests that individuals high in trait anxiety process and respond to threatening information differently than individuals low in trait anxiety. Trait anxiety is associated with an attentional bias toward threat (<a href=""#R8"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R8"">Bar-Haim et al., 2007</a>) as well as an enhanced memory of threatening information (<a href=""#R105"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R105"">Mitte, 2008</a>). Individuals high in trait anxiety also demonstrate impaired ability to inhibit distracting information, even under non-stressful conditions (Pacheco-Unguetti et al., 2010). Finally, individuals high in trait anxiety demonstrate lower cognitive flexibility, the ability to adapt one’s behavioral, emotional, and cognitive response to a situation in the face of new information (<a href=""#R96"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R96"">Martin &amp; Rubin, 1995</a>; <a href=""#R162"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R162"">Wang et al., 2019</a>). In sum, individuals high in trait anxiety prioritize threatening information over non-threatening information and experience difficulty in adapting to new information. Similarly, cognitive neuroscience research has found that individuals high in trait anxiety have executive functioning and decision-making impairments even in the absence of direct threat (<a href=""#R12"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R12"">Basten et al., 2012</a>; <a href=""#R20"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R20"">Bishop, 2009</a>; <a href=""#R64"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R64"">Gawda &amp; Szepietowska, 2016</a>), which may predispose them to cognitive biases prevalent in anxiety and depressive disorders.</p>"
"<p id=""P7"">Anxiety-related behavior includes avoidance of perceived threat as well as a tendency to escape any situation perceived as threatening. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that individuals high in trait anxiety may display increased avoidance behavior in the laboratory. However, it is difficult to measure general avoidance in a laboratory setting. One reason is that avoidance behavior may be more characteristic of trait fear, conceptualized as an underactive fear extinction process, compared to trait anxiety, which is characterized by sustained hyperarousal and hypervigilance (<a href=""#R151"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R151"">Sylvers et al., 2011</a>). Because many measures conflate trait fear and trait anxiety, important theoretical differences in these traits may be obscured in the literature (<a href=""#R86"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R86"">Lang et al., 2016</a>; <a href=""#R151"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R151"">Sylvers et al., 2011</a>). Although avoidance behavior may occur in trait anxious individuals, it is important to differentiate between avoidance of specific threats and avoidance of potential threats. The development of behavioral tasks that can measure responses to non-specific potential threats in the laboratory is necessary in order to more precisely examine behavioral correlates of trait anxiety.</p>"
"<p id=""P8"">Given that hyperarousal is hypothesized to be a component of trait anxiety (<a href=""#R41"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R41"">Clark &amp; Watson, 1991b</a>; <a href=""#R151"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R151"">Sylvers et al., 2011</a>), experimental research should demonstrate differential physiological responding between low trait-anxious and high trait-anxious individuals. Indeed, individuals high in trait anxiety demonstrate slower physiological recovery after a stressor (<a href=""#R29"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R29"">Calvo &amp; Cano-Vindel, 1997</a>; <a href=""#R174"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R174"">Willmann et al., 2012</a>). Individuals with anxiety-related disorders typically show impaired fear learning in the form of increased fear acquisition or prolonged fear extinction (<a href=""#R103"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R103"">Mineka &amp; Zinbarg, 2006</a>). However, evidence of a differential physiological response to fear learning between individuals high and low in trait anxiety is mixed. Several studies have found that high trait anxiety is associated with impaired safety learning, as indexed by increased physiological responding to safety signals (<a href=""#R65"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R65"">Gazendam et al., 2013</a>; <a href=""#R71"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R71"">Haddad et al., 2012</a>). However, other studies have found no effect of trait anxiety on fear generalization, as measured by fear-potentiated startle and skin conductance response (<a href=""#R155"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R155"">Torrents-Rodas et al., 2013</a>). <a href=""#R176"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R176"">Wong and Lovibond (2018)</a> suggest that ambiguity is the key factor in increased physiological responding to safety signals. When individuals high in trait anxiety face a situation that may signal threat, they appear to demonstrate increased arousal compared to their non-anxious counterparts.</p>"
"<p id=""P9"">Trait anxiety is also associated with important differences in brain structure and function. For example, individuals high in trait anxiety have reduced thickness in the orbitofrontal cortex (<a href=""#R85"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R85"">Kühn et al., 2011</a>), an area associated with extinction learning processes (<a href=""#R101"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R101"">Milad &amp; Rauch, 2007</a>), as well as reduced gyrification in the precuneus (<a href=""#R104"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R104"">Miskovich et al., 2016</a>). Decreased gyrification and thickness may indicate less structural connectivity, and thus less efficient processing, in cortical areas (<a href=""#R87"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R87"">Laughlin &amp; Sejnowski, 2003</a>). Research suggests that activity in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) correlates with trait anxiety (<a href=""#R5"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R5"">Avery et al., 2016</a>; <a href=""#R141"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R141"">Somerville et al., 2010</a>). Neural activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), one area centrally involved during emotion regulation, is negatively correlated with trait anxiety during fear conditioning (<a href=""#R95"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R95"">Marin et al., 2017</a>). Taken together, individuals high in trait anxiety have both structural and functional differences in important cortical areas, which may impair their ability to regulate anxious responding under threat. This impairment may then confer vulnerability for the development of anxiety and related disorders.</p>"
"<p id=""P10"">Trait anxiety may also have important sociocultural and demographic correlates that have important implications for the development of various forms of psychopathology. For example, women tend to score higher than men on the STAI-T, in both its nonclinical normative sample (<a href=""#R146"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R146"">Spielberger et al., 1983</a>), and throughout the broader literature (<a href=""#R98"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R98"">McLean &amp; Anderson, 2009</a>). Gender differences in trait anxiety have been replicated in cross-cultural studies in Israel (<a href=""#R18"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R18"">Ben-Zur &amp; Zeidner, 1988</a>), Egypt, and Brazil (<a href=""#R55"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R55"">El-Zahhar &amp; Hocevar, 1991</a>). In fact, it may be the case that the gender differences in anxiety and depression may be partially explained by the gender differences in trait anxiety. Trait anxiety may also decline with age, though prospective studies are lacking. While age was not correlated with trait anxiety for neuropsychiatric patients in the STAI normative samples (<a href=""#R146"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R146"">Spielberger et al., 1983</a>), a cross-sectional Japanese study found a linear decline in trait anxiety across a wide age range of adults (<a href=""#R112"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R112"">Nakazato &amp; Shimonaka, 1989</a>). Corresponding evidence suggests a decrease in anxiety and depressive disorder prevalence with age (<a href=""#R80"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R80"">Kessler et al., 2005</a>), and decreases in neuroticism with age (<a href=""#R133"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R133"">Roberts et al., 2006</a>). Because the majority of this research is cross-sectional in nature, some of these age-related differences in trait anxiety may be attributable to cohort effects. For example, in 1993, both adults and children in the United States endorsed significantly higher anxiety compared to adults and children in 1952 (<a href=""#R157"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R157"">Twenge, 2000</a>). While self-reported trait anxiety increased worldwide from 1970 to 2010, these increases have not been observed in the United Kingdom and Australia, and increases in anxiety may be limited to students in the United States and Canada (<a href=""#R22"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R22"">Booth et al. 2016</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P11"">Cross-cultural differences in trait anxiety have also been observed. For example, trait anxiety scores were found to be higher among college students in the Philippines, Turkey, and Mexico compared to the United States (<a href=""#R7"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R7"">Baloglu et al., 2007</a>). Additionally, high school students in Egypt reported higher trait anxiety compared to the United States and Brazil (<a href=""#R55"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R55"">El-Zahhar &amp; Hocevar, 1991</a>). A cross-cultural meta-analysis of trait anxiety, consisting of 116 samples in 24 countries, found a significant effect of country on trait anxiety, with country contributing about 31% of the variance in mean trait anxiety (Fischer &amp; Boer, 2011). In their examination of potential explanatory variables, Fischer and Boer found that both greater wealth and greater individualism were associated with lower trait anxiety, though the relationship between wealth and trait anxiety appears to be mediated by individualism.</p>"
"<p id=""P12"">The available evidence suggests that trait anxiety may reflect a distinct pattern of responding across cognitive, behavioral, physiological, and neural levels of analysis. This pattern of responding may confer vulnerability for the development of anxiety and related disorders (<a href=""#R3"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R3"">Andrews, 1991</a>; <a href=""#R57"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R57"">Eysenck, 1992</a>; <a href=""#R127"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R127"">Rachman, 1998</a>). As reviewed above, trait anxiety drives cognitive biases such as overestimation of threat, attention toward threat, increased perception of threat, and negative interpretations of threat (<a href=""#F1"" class=""usa-link"">Figure 1</a>). These biases lead to increased negative emotional experiences and maladaptive safety behaviors, which decrease immediate anxiety but maintain anxiety symptoms over the long term. For example, trait-anxious individuals may develop contamination fear if they overestimate the threat associated with contamination and interpret this threat as having a catastrophic outcome. These individuals would increasingly experience anxiety in the presence of contamination may develop specific behaviors, or compulsions, in order to reduce their anxiety in the short-term. However, these compulsions maintain the overestimation of threat and fear of contamination in the long-term, potentially leading to clinically significant symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Similarly, an individual high in trait anxiety who overestimates the threat of social evaluation, attends to others’ facial expressions and appraises them as negative and self-referential, and begins to avoid social situations may develop social anxiety disorder. Safety behaviors, such as avoidance and reassurance-seeking, reinforce cognitive biases as well as trait anxiety itself. Because trait anxiety has both stable and time-variant components (<a href=""#R44"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R44"">Cole et al., 2005</a>; <a href=""#R119"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R119"">Olatunji &amp; Cole, 2009</a>; <a href=""#R150"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R150"">Steyer et al., 1989</a>), occasion-specific behavioral factors may increase trait anxiety over time. A trait-anxious individual who learns that threat avoidance reduces short-term anxiety may deprive themselves of the opportunity to experience an expectancy violation that disconfirms their beliefs; over time, this individual may become increasingly anxious and avoidant as their beliefs about the nature of threat are reinforced.</p>"

"<p id=""P84"">Conceptual model demonstrating how trait anxiety can lead to the development of OCD through cognitive and behavioral sequelae.</p>"
"<p id=""P13"">Specific cognitive factors related to trait anxiety may explain how this underlying vulnerability may lead to the development of anxiety and depressive disorder symptoms. For instance, trait anxiety is strongly correlated with a tendency to overgeneralize, personalize, and catastrophize in both clinical and nonclinical groups (<a href=""#R107"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R107"">Muran &amp; Motta, 1993</a>); these cognitive distortions are a key contributing factor in the development and maintenance of anxiety and depressive disorders (<a href=""#R14"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R14"">Beck et al., 1979</a>). Among individuals who had experienced a traumatic event, trait anxiety was strongly correlated with negative beliefs about the self, negative beliefs about the world, and self-blame (<a href=""#R17"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R17"">J. G. Beck et al., 2004</a>; <a href=""#R62"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R62"">Foa et al., 1999</a>). In a recent longitudinal study, negative metacognitive beliefs about the uncontrollability and danger of worry had a statistically significant bidirectional relation with trait anxiety, suggesting that trait anxiety both prospectively influenced and was influenced by negative metacognitive beliefs over an eight-week period (<a href=""#R117"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R117"">Nordahl et al., 2019</a>). Thus, specific cognitive beliefs and biases are prevalent in individuals high in trait anxiety, which may in turn predispose these individuals to the development of psychopathology.</p>"
"<p id=""P14"">Trait anxiety is also associated with repetitive thinking, one cognitive mechanism associated with anxiety and depressive disorders (<a href=""#R50"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R50"">De Raedt et al., 2015</a>). For example, trait anxiety has been linked with increased use of worry and decreased use of distraction (<a href=""#R172"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R172"">Wells &amp; Carter, 2009</a>). The relation between these thinking styles and trait anxiety was independent of GAD and major depressive disorder (MDD) diagnostic status, suggesting that particular thinking styles are unique determinants of trait anxiety. Similarly, trait anxiety is strongly associated with rumination, a form of repetitive negative thinking that focuses on symptoms of distress and their causes and consequences (<a href=""#R110"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R110"">Muris et al., 2005</a>). Although a recent study found that repetitive negative thinking mediated the longitudinal relation between anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms (<a href=""#R148"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R148"">Spinhoven et al., 2019</a>), future studies should examine repetitive negative thinking as a potential mediator to test the hypothesized pathway from trait anxiety to later anxiety and depressive symptoms.</p>"
"<p id=""P15"">Finally, trait anxiety is associated with the proposed “fundamental fears”: anxiety sensitivity (the fear of anxiety symptoms and their potentially harmful consequences), illness/injury sensitivity (fears of injury, illness, and death), and fear of negative evaluation (distress associated with the expectations that others will evaluate oneself negatively; <a href=""#R130"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R130"">Reiss &amp; McNally, 1985</a>; <a href=""#R153"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R153"">Taylor, 1993</a>). According to Reiss’s expectancy theory, fear reactions, such as panic attacks and phobias, can be attributed to these fundamental fears. In a factor analysis of measures of the fundamental fears, <a href=""#R153"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R153"">Taylor (1993)</a> found that all three fundamental fears together contributed 41% of the variance in trait anxiety; fear of negative evaluation was moderately correlated with trait anxiety (<em>r</em> = .44), but zero-order relations between trait anxiety and both illness/injury sensitivity and anxiety sensitivity did not reach significance. Other studies have found statistically significant relations between anxiety sensitivity and trait anxiety (<a href=""#R154"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R154"">Taylor et al., 1991</a>). Anxiety sensitivity is strongly associated with anxiety-related disorders (<a href=""#R113"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R113"">Naragon-Gainey, 2010</a>); if anxiety sensitivity is a lower-order factor nested under trait anxiety (<a href=""#R91"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R91"">Lilienfeld et al., 1993</a>; <a href=""#R121"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R121"">Olatunji &amp; Wolitzky-Taylor, 2009</a>), anxiety sensitivity may be one specific mechanism by which trait anxiety confers vulnerability for anxiety-related disorders. For example, while trait anxiety was associated with post-hyperventilation symptoms, it no longer significantly predicted post-hyperventilation symptoms when controlling for anxiety sensitivity (<a href=""#R129"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R129"">Rapee &amp; Medoro, 1994</a>). Similarly, in a sample of individuals high in anxiety sensitivity, trait anxiety was not significantly associated with panic attacks, anxiety diagnoses, or any clinical diagnosis at baseline or two years later, but anxiety sensitivity demonstrated a prospective relation with anxiety disorder incidence (<a href=""#R137"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R137"">Schmidt et al., 2006</a>). Anxiety sensitivity may explain how an individual high in trait anxiety becomes sensitized to interpret physical symptoms of anxiety as threatening, conferring additional vulnerability for the development of a clinically significant anxiety-related disorder, especially in the case of panic disorder.</p>"
"<p id=""P16"">Elevated trait anxiety has been found in patients with panic disorder (<a href=""#R9"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R9"">Barlow, 1988</a>; <a href=""#R108"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R108"">Muris et al., 2000</a>), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD; <a href=""#R128"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R128"">Rapee, 1991</a>), and social anxiety disorder (Amir et al., 2005) compared to healthy individuals. In fact, trait anxiety has been found to be associated with significantly greater odds of having an adult anxiety-related disorder even when controlling for the effects of childhood perceived stress (<a href=""#R106"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R106"">Mundy et al., 2015</a>). In a study examining the specificity of disgust proneness, <a href=""#R109"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R109"">Muris and colleagues (1999)</a> found that disgust proneness was correlated with a broad range of symptoms of anxiety-related disorders in children. However, results also indicated that these correlations were predominantly accounted for by trait anxiety. That is, when controlling for trait anxiety, only specific phobia symptoms and separation anxiety disorder symptoms were significantly related to disgust proneness. This finding suggests that trait anxiety underlies a broad number of childhood anxiety-related disorders and thus is an important indicator of early vulnerability for anxiety-related psychopathology. Although most studies linking trait anxiety to symptoms of anxiety-related disorders have been cross-sectional, prospective research has also examined this hypothesized causal link. For example, one such study examined patients from a GAD treatment trial 8 to 14 years after completing treatment (<a href=""#R36"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R36"">Chambers et al., 2004</a>). The findings showed that pre-treatment trait anxiety was significantly correlated with the number of anxiety and depressive diagnoses at follow-up. However, after controlling for negative affect, only trait anxiety measured at long-term follow-up was significantly correlated with GAD and depression status, whereas pre-treatment trait anxiety was not. Despite its conceptualization as a stable vulnerability factor, measures of trait anxiety might also reflect current symptom severity. Although pre-treatment trait anxiety may predict comorbidity post-treatment, it does not appear to uniquely predict anxiety or depressive symptoms beyond negative affect.</p>"
"<p id=""P17"">Although obsessive-compulsive and related disorders are no longer classified with the anxiety disorders in the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-5; <a href=""#R2"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R2"">American Psychiatric Association, 2013</a>) and the <em>International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems</em> (ICD-11; <a href=""#R177"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R177"">World Health Organization, 2020</a>), evidence suggests that trait anxiety plays a significant role in obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Trait anxiety is elevated in OCD compared to both healthy individuals and to individuals with other anxiety-related disorders (Abramowitz et al., 2003). In particular, trait anxiety is significantly correlated with obsessions, but not compulsions, in OCD patients (<a href=""#R97"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R97"">McKay et al., 1995</a>). Obsessions are a repetitive thought process and share features with worry and rumination, two other repetitive thinking styles that are associated with trait anxiety (<a href=""#R110"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R110"">Muris et al., 2005</a>); compulsions are a set of behaviors typically performed to reduce the anxiety that arises from obsessions and are more specific to OCD than anxiety. Although there is an increased focus on the role of disgust in OCD, structural models confirm that trait anxiety remains a statistically significant predictor of obsessive-compulsive symptoms even when disgust proneness is included in the model (<a href=""#R120"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R120"">Olatunji et al., 2007</a>). Finally, trait anxiety is also associated with hoarding symptoms (<a href=""#R156"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R156"">Tolin et al., 2011</a>). This suggests that the stable tendency to experience negative emotions such as fears, worries, and anxiety across many situations may lead to a persistent difficulty discarding or parting with possessions because of a perceived need to save them.</p>"
"<p id=""P18"">The study of trauma-related disorders, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and acute stress disorder, provides a unique opportunity to examine potential causal relations, as the experience of trauma is typically independent of premorbid trait anxiety. Several cross-sectional studies demonstrate a statistically significant relation between the experience of PTSD symptoms and trait anxiety (Casada &amp; Roache, 2005; <a href=""#R122"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R122"">Orsillo et al., 1996</a>). Trait anxiety is also correlated with acute stress disorder symptoms (Suliman et al., 2013). In two studies of children, trait anxiety was more predictive of PTSD symptom severity than the nature of the traumatic event itself, including severity of cancer diagnosis (Phipps et al., 2009) or strength of hurricane experienced (<a href=""#R93"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R93"">Lonigan et al., 1994</a>). However, because these studies are cross-sectional in nature, they do not allow researchers to determine <em>who</em> may develop PTSD after a traumatic experience. A limited number of prospective studies attempt to answer this question. Trait anxiety, measured when patients received a cancer diagnosis, was significantly predictive of PTSD symptoms six months later (<a href=""#R78"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R78"">Kangas et al., 2005</a>). Individuals high in trait anxiety, measured immediately after treatment for rectal cancer, were also more likely to endorse PTSD symptoms two to five years later (<a href=""#R132"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R132"">Ristvedt &amp; Trinkaus, 2009</a>). In a study following patients one and a half to four years after cardiac surgery, trait anxiety mediated the relation between stress exposure and PTSD, thus outlining a potential causal mechanism for how individuals who experience a stressful event later develop PTSD (<a href=""#R81"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R81"">Kok et al., 2016</a>). In addition to studies of patients undergoing medical procedures, two other studies demonstrate prospective relations between trait anxiety and PTSD. For example, children’s trait anxiety measured before Hurricane Katrina predicted PTSD symptoms, as well as GAD and depression, after the hurricane (<a href=""#R169"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R169"">Weems et al., 2007</a>). Finally, in a prospective study of college students who later experienced a campus shooting, anxiety sensitivity (one potential lower-order factor of trait anxiety) predicted PTSD symptoms (<a href=""#R21"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R21"">Boffa et al., 2016</a>). However, given that trait anxiety itself was not specifically assessed, this study cannot differentiate between the prospective effects of trait anxiety and anxiety sensitivity on PTSD symptoms.</p>"
"<p id=""P19"">Although trait anxiety refers to the stable tendency to attend to and experience fear, worry, and anxiety across many situations, there is increasing evidence that this personality trait may not be specific to anxiety-related disorders. While some studies have found comparable levels of trait anxiety in individuals with depression and anxiety-related disorders (Christopher &amp; MacDonald, 2005), others find significantly higher trait anxiety in depressive compared to anxious clinical samples (<a href=""#R10"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R10"">Barlow et al., 1986</a>; D’Avanzato et al., 2013; Power &amp; Tarsia, 2007). In a recent study, trait anxiety was positively correlated with depression; rumination mediated the relation between trait anxiety and depressive symptoms, but cognitive flexibility buffered this association (<a href=""#R162"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R162"">Wang et al., 2019</a>). This study demonstrates that the findings on cognitive biases and executive functioning impairment associated with trait anxiety, as described above, also influence depressive symptoms. Together, these findings question the extent to which trait anxiety is a vulnerability factor that is specific to anxious psychopathology.</p>"
"<p id=""P20"">A review of the literature suggests that trait anxiety may be implicated in both anxiety and depression as well as the cognitive factors that confer vulnerability for these disorders. This review suggests that trait anxiety may reflect a nonspecific vulnerability factor that is a product of a generalized vulnerability for anxiety and depression. For example, <a href=""#R41"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R41"">Clark and Watson (1991b)</a> have argued for a tripartite model of anxiety and depression, suggesting that these disorders share a nonspecific distress factor at their core, in addition to the specific factors of hyperarousal (anxiety) and low positive affect (depression). This nonspecific distress factor has been described as negative affectivity/neuroticism, the general tendency to experience negative emotions (<a href=""#R164"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R164"">Watson &amp; Clark, 1984</a>). Negative affectivity/neuroticism is a key vulnerability factor in the development of psychopathology, of which trait anxiety may be a part (<a href=""#R42"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R42"">Clark et al., 1994</a>). Although symptoms of psychopathology can change widely over time, negative affectivity/neuroticism is hypothesized to be a relatively stable construct, and measures of negative affectivity/neuroticism have high test-retest reliability over periods of years (<a href=""#R164"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R164"">Watson &amp; Clark, 1984</a>). Like trait anxiety, negative affectivity/neuroticism is a robust vulnerability factor for both anxiety and depressive disorders (<a href=""#R82"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R82"">Kotov et al., 2010</a>; Shackman et al., 2016) and is associated with a biased information processing style that prioritizes safety (Van den Bergh et al., in press).</p>"
"<p id=""P21"">The existing research suggests that both trait anxiety and negative affectivity/neuroticism confer vulnerability for the development of anxiety-related disorders and depression. However, this may be because trait anxiety and negative affectivity/neuroticism are essentially the same construct. In fact, many researchers use the terms negative affectivity, neuroticism, and trait anxiety interchangeably. For example, in discussing the negative affect factor they derived within a clinically anxious sample, <a href=""#R180"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R180"">Zinbarg and Barlow (1996)</a> noted:
</p>"
"<p id=""P22"">Though these traits are defined slightly differently and given different labels in each of these models — harm avoidance (Cloninger), neuroticism (Eysenck), trait anxiety (Gray), behavioral inhibition (Kagan), and negative affectivity (Tellegen) — the conceptual and empirical overlap among these constructs far outweigh the differences.</p>"
"<p class=""font-xs text-right text-italic"" aria-label=""Attribution"">(p. 181)</p>"
"<p>
Similarly, <a href=""#R38"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R38"">Clark and Beck (2010)</a> refer to trait anxiety and negative affectivity as “almost synonymous.” Further complicating this issue is how trait anxiety is often measured. Although there is a rich body of literature demonstrating the cognitive, behavioral, physiological, and neural correlates of trait anxiety, as well as its central role in both anxiety and depressive disorders, much of this research relies on the use of a single self-report measure of trait anxiety: the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). While the STAI has a robust history, it also has a number of psychometric limitations that suggest that this widely used measure may not adequately capture the specific construct of trait anxiety.</p>"
"<p id=""P24"">Many specific measures of trait anxiety have been developed, including the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale (TMAS; <a href=""#R152"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R152"">Taylor, 1953</a>), Adult Manifest Anxiety Scale (AMAS; <a href=""#R131"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R131"">Reynolds et al., 2003</a>), Institute for Personality and Ability Testing (IPAT) Anxiety Scale (<a href=""#R84"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R84"">Krug et al., 1976</a>), the Endler Multidimensional Anxiety Scales (EMAS; <a href=""#R56"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R56"">Endler et al., 1991</a>), and the State-Trait Inventory for Cognitive and Somatic Anxiety (STICSA; <a href=""#R70"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R70"">Grös, et al., 2007</a>). Similarly, a number of personality measures include trait anxiety scales, including the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO PI-R; <a href=""#R47"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R47"">Costa &amp; McRae, 1992</a>), the HEXACO Personality Inventory-Revised (HEXACO-PI-R; <a href=""#R89"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R89"">Lee &amp; Ashton, 2004</a>, and the Jackson Personality Inventory-Revised (JPI-R; <a href=""#R76"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R76"">Jackson, 1994</a>). However, the STAI is the most well-known and most cited measure of trait anxiety (<a href=""#F2"" class=""usa-link"">Figure 2</a>). The STAI has two subscales: state anxiety, measuring “subjective feelings of apprehension, ‘anxious’ expectation, and activation (arousal) of the autonomic nervous system” (STAI-S), and trait anxiety, measuring “individual differences in anxiety proneness” (STAI-T; <a href=""#R143"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R143"">Spielberger, 1966</a>, p. 17). The STAI consists of 40 items, 20 for each subscale. Items are rated on a Likert scale from 1 (not at all/almost never) to 4 (very much so/almost always), and some items are reverse-scored. Individuals are asked to indicate how they feel “right now, at this moment” for the STAI-S and how they “generally feel” for the STAI-T.</p>"

"<p id=""P25"">Initial reviews of the STAI were laudatory and praised the measure for being brief, inexpensive, and easy to administer, score, and interpret, with a thorough test manual (Hedberg, 1972). Although the STAI has been cited in over 31,000 articles and translated into 70 languages and dialects (<a href=""#R144"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R144"">Spielberger, 2010</a>; <a href=""#F2"" class=""usa-link"">Figure 2</a>), it has not been without criticism for its psychometric properties. While the STAI-T demonstrated acceptable test-retest reliability in normative samples (.73 to .86; <a href=""#R146"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R146"">Spielberger, 1983</a>), others have raised concerns. In an early examination, <a href=""#R79"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R79"">Kendall and colleagues (1976)</a> noted that trait anxiety scores fluctuated significantly when measured across different situations, indicating poor reliability of the STAI-T. Similarly, <a href=""#R116"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R116"">Nixon and Steffeck (1977)</a> found low to moderate test-retest reliability for the STAI-T in a sample of medical students across an 8 to 11-month period. A subsequent review found that the average test-retest reliability of the STAI-T was .88 across seven studies published from 1990 to 2000 (Barnes et al., 2002). Notably, however, the majority of studies using the STAI-T either do not include reliability information or only provide information on internal consistency. Similarly, few studies have examined measurement invariance, testing if the scale measures the same construct across different groups. One such study examined the STAI-T, Behavioral Inhibition Scale (BIS; <a href=""#R31"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R31"">Carver &amp; White, 1994</a>) and Fear Survey Schedule (FSS; <a href=""#R175"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R175"">Wolpe &amp; Lang, 1964</a>) among university students and community members and found evidence for distinct trait anxiety, behavioral inhibition, social fear, and tissue damage fear factors (<a href=""#R46"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R46"">Cooper et al., 2007</a>). Within their sample, the model demonstrated configural invariance, full metric invariance, and scalar invariance across gender. Larger examinations of both test-retest reliability and measurement invariance across clinical populations, age groups, and nationalities are warranted.</p>"
"<p id=""P26"">The first published version of the STAI-T (Form X) contained six items that were “more closely related to depression than anxiety” (e.g., “I feel blue,” “I feel like crying”), leading to a subsequent revision and publication of Form Y (<a href=""#R144"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R144"">Spielberger, 2010</a>; <a href=""#R146"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R146"">Spielberger et al., 1983</a>). However, many published articles that have used the STAI do not specify which version of the measure was used. Furthermore, not all validated translations of the STAI use the revised Form Y; the widely used German version of the STAI is based on Form X (<a href=""#R88"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R88"">Laux et al., 1981</a>). Despite efforts to revise the scale by considering items that allow for differentiation from depression, the STAI-T contains some items that do not clearly reflect a trait predisposition to the experience of anxiety; for example, items such as “I take disappointments so keenly that I can’t put them out of my mind” and “I am happy” (reverse-scored) seem to be more strongly related to a depressive state or a tendency to experience negative emotions more generally than to trait anxiety specifically. Indeed, there is concern that the STAI-T may not reliably discriminate between anxiety and depression. For example, <a href=""#R41"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R41"">Clark and Watson (1991b)</a> examined four studies of over 1,600 non-clinical participants and found an average correlation of .65 between the STAI-T (Form X) and measures of depression, and an average correlation of .75 between the STAI-T and measures of anxiety. Among two studies of 281 clinical participants, the average correlation between the STAI-T and other anxiety measures reached <em>r</em> = .80, whereas the average correlation between the STAI and depression measures was <em>r</em> = .67. The strong correlation between the STAI-T and measures of depression indicates a lack of discriminant evidence of validity. In fact, some studies have even shown that the revised STAI-T (Form Y) more strongly correlates with measures of depression than with measures of anxiety. For instance, among Canadian patients with anxiety-related disorders, the STAI-T (Form Y) was strongly correlated with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI; <em>r</em> = .72) and only moderately correlated with the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI; <em>r</em> = .42; Bieling et al., 1998). In a sample of Spanish students, the STAI-T (Form Y) was strongly correlated with measures of depression, <em>r</em>s = .62–.75, and moderately correlated with measures of anxiety, <em>r</em>s = .46–.61 (<a href=""#R6"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R6"">Bados et al., 2010</a>). Similarly, Balsamo and colleagues (2013) found that the STAI-T (Form Y) was strongly correlated with the BDI-II in a large (<em>N</em> = 877) non-clinical sample of Italian adults (<em>r</em> = .70) and only moderately correlated with the BAI in a smaller subsample (<em>N</em> = 151, <em>r</em> = .61). Similarly, in their large clinical sample of Italian adults (<em>N</em> = 1124), correlations with the STAI-T were stronger with the BDI-II (<em>r</em> = .76) than with the BAI (<em>r</em> = .55).</p>"
"<p id=""P27"">Factor analytic studies have also called into question the anxiety-specific nature of the STAI. Although two subscales of the STAI are typically reported (STAI-T and STAI-S), the original factor analysis of the measure found that four factors best fit the data: state anxiety present, state anxiety absent, trait anxiety present, and trait anxiety absent (<a href=""#R147"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R147"">Spielberger et al., 1980</a>). Items that load onto the “anxiety absent” factors include “I feel pleasant” and “I am calm;” their positive wording may indicate that these factors are detecting a method effect, in which reverse-scored items load onto separate factors. Indeed, a two-construct, two-method model appears to fit the measure better than both a four-factor model and a two-factor model (<a href=""#R159"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R159"">Vigneau &amp; Cormier, 2008</a>). Subsequent research by Bieling and colleagues (1998) found evidence for a hierarchical model of the STAI-T items consisting of a higher-order negative affect factor and two lower-order specific factors of depression and anxiety (named STAI-D and STAI-A). Regarding the two lower order-factors, one set of items appear to assess anxiety and worry, whereas the other items assess sadness and self-deprecation. Interestingly, the STAI-A subscale was found to be strongly correlated with both the BDI (<em>r</em> = .66) and the BAI (<em>r</em> = .50). Similarly, <a href=""#R6"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R6"">Bados and colleagues (2010)</a> found that the STAI-A subscale was more strongly correlated with the depression subscales (<em>r</em>s = .49–.67) than with the anxiety subscales (<em>r</em>s = .43–.58) of three well-validated measures (BDI/BAI, DASS-21, SCL-90-R). Another factor analytic study in a French student sample found that a 3-factor solution best fit the data, corresponding to anxiety, “unsuccessfulness” or anhedonia, and happiness (Caci et al., 2003). This is further evidence that although the STAI-T is a popular measure of anxiety, it may assess depression as well as anxiety.</p>"
"<p id=""P28"">In fact, the STAI-T is highly correlated with measures of negative affectivity/neuroticism. <a href=""#R164"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R164"">Watson and Clark (1984)</a> reported a correlation of <em>r</em> = .73 between the STAI-T and the Eysenck Personality Inventory Neuroticism scale in their seminal review of personality scales relevant to the construct of negative affectivity/neuroticism. Other clinical samples report similarly strong correlations (<em>r</em>s = .61–.86; <a href=""#R48"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R48"">Dammen et al., 2008</a>; <a href=""#R94"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R94"">Luteijn &amp; Bouman, 1988</a>; Merino et al., 2016). One explanation for the high degree of overlap between the STAI-T and measures of negative affectivity/neuroticism is that the STAI-T does not actually measure a specific anxiety vulnerability factor. Rather, the evidence suggests that the STAI-T is a measure of the nonspecific distress factor that characterizes both anxiety-related disorders and depression in Clark and Watson’s tripartite model. Put another way, the STAI-T may not differentiate between anxiety-related disorders and depression because it measures general negative affectivity/neuroticism rather than the specific facet of trait anxiety.</p>"
"<p id=""P29"">The overall goal of this review is to evaluate the STAI-T and its association with both anxiety and depressive disorders using a meta-analytic approach. Meta-analysis is one tool by which validity evidence for a given test, such as the STAI, can be examined (<a href=""#R1"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R1"">American Educational Research Association, American Psychological Association, &amp; National Council on Measurement in Education, 2014</a>). If the STAI demonstrates strong relationships with clinical measures of anxiety symptoms or diagnostic status, this would support its convergent validity. For the STAI to be a useful measure, however, it must also demonstrate discriminant evidence of validity; relationships with measures of depressive symptoms or diagnostic status should not be as strong as those with measures of anxiety.</p>"
"<p id=""P30"">As is evident from the above review, it remains unclear whether trait anxiety, as assessed by the STAI-T, is a broad vulnerability factor for both anxiety and depression or a more specific vulnerability to anxiety-related disorders. Given that the STAI-T continues to be the measure most commonly used to assess trait anxiety and that the scale may reflect a broader measure of negative affectivity/neuroticism rather than a specific measure of trait anxiety, the present investigation employs a meta-analytic approach to examine the association between trait anxiety and symptoms of depression and anxiety-related disorders. Consistent with a categorical view, meta-analytic comparisons were made on STAI-T scores among those meeting diagnostic criteria for a depressive disorder, an anxiety-related disorder, and nonclinical comparisons. The purpose of this portion of the review was to answer the following three questions:
</p>"
"<p id=""P31"">To what extent do STAI-T scores differ between nonclinical comparison groups and those with a) an anxiety-related disorder and b) a depressive disorder?</p>"
"<p id=""P32"">To what extent do STAI-T scores differ among those with an anxiety-related disorder compared to those with a depressive disorder?</p>"
"<p id=""P33"">Are differences between those with an anxiety-related disorder, those with a depressive disorder, and nonclinical comparisons influenced by anxiety and depressive disorder comorbidity?</p>"
"<p id=""P34"">Next, meta-analyses were performed on correlations of STAI-T scores with measures of anxiety and depressive symptoms within clinically-diagnosed individuals in order to determine the extent of the relationship between anxiety and depression severity and STAI-T scores. In addition to delineating the specific associations between STAI-T scores and depression and anxiety, gender and age were examined as moderators, given that women are 1.7 times more likely to be diagnosed with an anxiety-related disorder (<a href=""#R99"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R99"">McLean et al., 2011</a>) and 1.5 times more likely to be diagnosed with a mood disorder compared to men, and rates of anxiety and depression differ by age (<a href=""#R80"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R80"">Kessler et al., 2005</a>). An insufficient number of studies reported race/ethnicity, precluding further analysis. Comorbidity and medication status were also included as moderators, as rates of comorbidity (<a href=""#R40"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R40"">Clark &amp; Watson, 1991a</a>) and the degree to which symptoms are managed by medication (<a href=""#R142"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R142"">Soskin et al., 2012</a>) both likely influence self-reported negative affectivity/neuroticism and thus may affect scores on the STAI-T.</p>"
"<p id=""P35"">A literature search was conducted in the PsycINFO and PubMed databases to identify empirical articles, published in English, that reported scores on the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) within adult populations. Peer-reviewed studies published from January 1, 1970 through April 15, 2020 were included in the search, in accordance with the publication date of the STAI manual. The full search terms and specifiers are detailed in <a href=""#SD1"" class=""usa-link"">Supplementary Table 1</a>. The initial search in PsycINFO of all peer-reviewed research articles that specified the use of the STAI in the “Tests and Measures” search field, including potential name variations, yielded 11,362 abstracts. The lead author and a team of trained undergraduate research assistants reviewed each abstract according to the following criteria: (a) included individuals aged 18 and older, who were (b) diagnosed according to DSM or ICD criteria with a current anxiety-related disorder (panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, specific phobia, posttraumatic stress disorder, acute stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, illness anxiety disorder, hoarding disorder; see <a href=""#R4"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R4"">Asmundson, 2019</a>) OR (c) a current depressive disorder, including major depressive disorder, minor depressive disorder, or dysthymia; (d) included a comparison group of healthy individuals OR (e) two groups of individuals diagnosed with different anxiety and depressive disorders as defined above; (f) reported scores on the 20-item Trait version of the STAI. Studies of individuals with psychotic disorders, intellectual disabilities or pervasive developmental disorder, bipolar disorder, adjustment disorder, or an anxiety or depressive disorder in remission were not included, unless separate groups of individuals with anxiety and/or depressive disorders were also reported, and individuals in these groups did not meet the exclusion criteria. After reviewing all abstracts according to these criteria, 863 eligible studies remained. The lead author reviewed all full texts according to these same inclusion criteria. Studies were excluded if they (g) did not report means and standard deviations for the STAI-T by the groups defined above or correlations with measures of anxiety or depressive symptoms, (h) only reported the state scale of the STAI, or (i) included samples overlapping with other published studies. Where the published STAI-T mean was not within the accepted range for this measure (20–80), or where the reported subscale (state or trait) of the STAI was not clear, study authors were contacted for clarifying information. Where STAI-T data was reported at multiple time points, only baseline STAI-T values were included. After review of the full-texts, 383 articles identified in PsycINFO were included in the current meta-analysis.</p>"
"<p id=""P36"">A literature search was also conducted in the PubMed database to identify articles published in journals not indexed within the PsycINFO database. The initial search included articles published in English and conducted with humans and contained the terms “State-Trait Anxiety Inventory” along with variations of the measure name. A complete list of search terms is included in <a href=""#SD1"" class=""usa-link"">Supplementary Table 1</a>. A total of 3,934 abstracts were identified according to these search criteria. Of these, 2,118 abstracts were duplicate abstracts included in journals indexed in PsycINFO, leaving 1,816 unique abstracts for review according to the criteria specified above. Of these, 30 abstracts met eligibility criteria and the full texts were reviewed by the lead author. Five additional articles containing valid STAI-T data according to the specified criteria were included in the meta-analysis from the PubMed database.

"<p id=""P37"">Effect sizes for STAI-T scores were calculated using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) Version 3 (<a href=""#R24"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R24"">Borenstein et al., 2014</a>), comparing STAI-T means and standard deviations between (1) individuals with an anxiety-related disorder compared to a healthy comparison group, (2) individuals with a depressive disorder compared to a healthy comparison group, (3) individuals with an anxiety-related disorder compared to individuals with a depressive disorder, (4) individuals with comorbid anxiety and depression compared to individuals with an anxiety-related disorder only, and (5) individuals with comorbid anxiety and depression compared to individuals with depression only. Given heterogeneity among studies, random-effects models were used. Subgroup analyses were conducted independently by diagnosis when there were at least ten studies in a given subgroup (<a href=""#R73"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R73"">Higgins &amp; Green, 2011</a>). Hedges’s <em>g</em> was used as the effect size measure; Hedges’s <em>g</em> effect sizes can be interpreted according to the benchmarks used for Cohen’s <em>d</em> (0.2 = small; 0.5 = medium; 0.8 = large; <a href=""#R43"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R43"">Cohen, 1992</a>). Separate meta-analyses were also conducted on the correlations between the STAI-T and (6) measures of anxiety symptoms and (7) measures of depressive symptoms. Correlations were first transformed using the Fisher’s <em>z</em> transformation; summary values were converted back into correlations to be reported (<a href=""#R23"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R23"">Borenstein et al., 2009</a>). Mean correlations were interpreted according to Cohen’s conventions for correlation coefficients (0.1 = small; 0.3 = medium; 0.5 = large; <a href=""#R43"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R43"">Cohen, 1992</a>). Observed power was &gt; 0.99 for all meta-analyses except for the comparison between individuals with an anxiety-related disorder and those with a depressive disorder, which was 0.85 (<a href=""#R126"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R126"">Quintana &amp; Tiebel, 2019</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P38"">Publication bias was assessed using multiple methods. First, funnel plots were visually inspected, and Egger’s regression analysis was used to determine the significance of asymmetry (<a href=""#R53"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R53"">Egger et al., 1997</a>). Next, Rosenthal’s fail-safe <em>N</em> was calculated to determine the number of additional studies with an effect size of zero needed to reduce the effect size of the meta-analysis to non-significance (<em>p</em> &gt; 0.05; <a href=""#R135"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R135"">Rosenthal, 1979</a>). Another measure, Orwin’s fail-safe <em>N</em>, was also calculated in order to assess the number of studies with effects size of zero needed in order to bring the overall effect size to a trivial level, set at Hedges’s <em>g</em> = 0.1 and mean <em>r</em> = .05 (<a href=""#R123"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R123"">Orwin, 1983</a>). Because observed heterogeneity was large (<a href=""#T1"" class=""usa-link"">Table 1</a>), potential moderators (mean age, percent female, rates of comorbid anxiety and depression, and percent of individuals on psychoactive medication) were assessed using meta-regression. For categorical moderators (region; STAI Form X vs. Form Y), dummy variables were created for use in the meta-regression model. Due to rates of missingness across studies, each potential moderator was examined in a separate meta-regression model.</p>"

"<p id=""P43"">When comparing individuals with a depressive disorder with nonclinical comparison groups, rates of comorbid anxiety-related disorders did not significantly affect STAI-T scores, <em>Q</em> = 0.21, <em>p</em> = .65.

Anxiety comorbidity did not moderate the difference in STAI-T scores between individuals with anxiety-related disorders and individuals with depressive disorders, <em>Q</em> = 0.22, <em>p</em> = .90, and depressive comorbidity also did not did not moderate the difference in STAI-T scores between these groups, <em>Q</em> = 0.02, <em>p</em> = .99. <a href=""#T2"" class=""usa-link"">Table 2</a> displays the results of these comorbidity moderation analyses.</p>"

"<p id=""P44"">All other moderation analyses are displayed in <a href=""#T2"" class=""usa-link"">Table 2</a>. The gender composition of the groups did not affect the difference in STAI-T scores between individuals with an anxiety-related disorder compared to nonclinical comparison groups, <em>Q</em> = 1.54<em>, p</em> = .21, or individuals with a depressive disorder compared to nonclinical comparison groups, <em>Q</em> = 2.31<em>, p</em> = .13. Gender also did not moderate the difference in STAI-T scores between individuals with anxiety-related disorders and individuals with depressive disorders, <em>Q</em> = 0.68<em>, p</em> = .71. However, gender did moderate the effect size between nonclinical comparison groups and specific anxiety-related disorders. For individuals with GAD and OCD, an increased percent of women in the sample was associated with a significantly higher STAI-T score compared to nonclinical comparison groups, <em>Q</em><sub><em>GAD</em></sub> = 4.39, <em>p</em> = .04, <em>R</em><sup>2</sup> analog = 0.12; <em>Q</em><sub><em>OCD</em></sub> = 4.43, <em>p</em> = .04, <em>R</em><sup>2</sup> analog = 0.17.

"<p id=""P45"">Age did not significantly moderate the difference in STAI-T scores between individuals with an anxiety-related disorder compared to nonclinical comparison groups, <em>Q</em> = 1.93<em>, p</em> = .17, or individuals with a depressive disorder compared to nonclinical comparison groups, <em>Q</em> = 0.65<em>, p</em> = .42. However, specific disorders did show relations with age. For individuals with panic disorder, younger individuals had significantly higher STAI-T scores compared to nonclinical comparison groups, <em>Q</em> = 5.51, <em>p</em> = .02, <em>R</em><sup>2</sup> analog = 0.12. For individuals with a specific phobia, age had the opposite effect; older individuals had significantly higher STAI-T scores compared to nonclinical comparison groups, <em>Q</em> = 8.91, <em>p</em> &lt; .01, <em>R</em><sup>2</sup> analog = 0.80. For individuals with MDD, younger individuals had higher STAI-T scores than non-clinical comparison groups, <em>Q</em> = 4.67, <em>p</em> = .03, <em>R</em><sup>2</sup> analog = 0.00.

"<p id=""P46"">Rates of psychoactive medication did not moderate differences in STAI-T scores between individuals with anxiety-related disorders, <em>Q</em> = 0.00<em>, p</em> = .98, or individuals with depressive disorders compared to nonclinical comparison groups, <em>Q</em> = 0.03<em>, p</em> = .87. However, a trend was observed for individuals with GAD compared to nonclinical comparison groups, such that higher rates of medication use in the sample were associated with lower STAI-T scores, <em>Q</em> = 2.87, <em>p</em> = .09. An insufficient number of studies included medication information to allow for comparison between individuals with anxiety and depressive disorders.</p>"
"<p id=""P47"">Because there are significant differences between Form X and Form Y of the STAI, comparisons were conducted between studies that used each form. For comparisons between individuals with anxiety-related disorders and nonclinical comparison groups, the form of the STAI used was a statistically significant moderator. Studies using Form Y (<em>k</em> = 180, <em>g</em> = 1.99) showed significantly higher STAI-T scores for individuals with anxiety-related disorders compared to nonclinical comparison groups than studies using Form X (<em>k</em> = 141, <em>g</em> = 1.75), <em>Q</em> = 6.58, <em>p</em> = .01. The form of the STAI used did not significantly affect differences in STAI-T scores between individuals with depressive disorders and nonclinical comparison groups, <em>Q</em> = 0.18, <em>p</em> = .67, or between individuals with anxiety-related disorders and individuals with depressive disorders, <em>Q</em> = 0.08, <em>p</em> = .86.</p>"
"<p id=""P48"">Regional differences in STAI-T scores were also found. For studies comparing individuals with an anxiety-related disorder and nonclinical comparison groups, the region in which the study was conducted significantly moderated the difference in STAI-T scores, <em>Q</em> = 42.05, <em>p</em> &lt; .001. Specifically, studies conducted in China (<em>k</em> = 25), Germany and Austria (<em>k</em> = 75), Israel (<em>k</em> = 12), Italy (<em>k</em> = 17), Japan (<em>k</em> = 16), South Korea (<em>k</em> = 9), Spain (<em>k</em> = 10), Western Europe (<em>k</em> = 15, includes France, the Netherlands, and Belgium), and other European countries (<em>k</em> = 8, includes Hungary, Poland, Croatia, Greece, Sweden, and Norway) had significantly smaller differences in STAI-T scores between individuals with an anxiety-related disorder and nonclinical comparison groups than studies conducted in the United States (<em>k</em> = 97), all <em>p</em>s &lt; .04. Studies comparing individuals with anxiety-related disorders and nonclinical comparison groups that were conducted in Australia and New Zealand (<em>k</em> = 7), Canada (<em>k</em> = 7), South America (<em>k</em> = 3), Switzerland (<em>k</em> = 14), Turkey (<em>k</em> = 10), and the United Kingdom (<em>k</em> = 27) did not significantly differ from studies conducted in the United States, all <em>p</em>s &gt; .16 (see <a href=""#T2"" class=""usa-link"">Table 2</a> for full results). For studies comparing individuals with a depressive disorder and nonclinical comparison groups, the region in which the study was conducted significantly moderated the difference in STAI-T scores, <em>Q</em> = 27.35, <em>p</em> &lt; .001. Specifically, studies conducted in Asia (<em>k</em> = 9), including China, Japan, South Korea, and Russia (Siberia), had significantly smaller differences in STAI-T scores between individuals with a depressive disorder and nonclinical comparison groups than studies conducted in the United States (<em>k</em> = 21), <em>β</em> = −1.11, <em>SE</em> = 0.38, <em>p</em> &lt; .01. Studies conducted in the United Kingdom (<em>k</em> = 10) had a larger effect than studies conducted in the United States, <em>β</em> = 0.90, <em>SE</em> = 0.38, <em>p</em> = .02. For all other regions (Australia, Canada, Europe, Germany and Austria, the Middle East, and South America), effect sizes did not differ from studies conducted in the United States.</p>"
"<p id=""P49"">Correlations were examined between the STAI-T and measures of anxiety symptoms, including the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ; <a href=""#R100"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R100"">Meyer et al., 1990</a>), Obsessive Compulsive Inventory — Revised (OCI-R; <a href=""#R61"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R61"">Foa et al., 2002</a>), the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS; <a href=""#R66"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R66"">Goodman et al., 1989</a>), the Hypochondriasis Y-BOCS (H-YBOCS; <a href=""#R140"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R140"">Skritskaya et al., 2012</a>), the Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS; <a href=""#R49"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R49"">Davidson et al., 1997</a>), the Acute Stress Disorder Interview (ASDI; <a href=""#R28"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R28"">Bryant et al.,1998</a>), the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS; <a href=""#R90"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R90"">Liebowitz, 1987</a>), the Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS; <a href=""#R134"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R134"">Rodebaugh et al., 2007</a>), the Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN; <a href=""#R45"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R45"">Connor et al., 2000</a>), and the Symptoms Rating Scale for Depression and Anxiety, Anxiety subscale (SRSDA; <a href=""#R13"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R13"">Bech, 1993</a>).

"<p id=""P50"">Correlations were also available between the STAI-T and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI; <a href=""#R16"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R16"">Beck et al., 1961</a>) and Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II; <a href=""#R15"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R15"">Beck et al., 1996</a>) within clinically anxious or depressed samples (<em>k</em> = 13). The STAI-T was strongly correlated with depressive symptom severity, mean <em>r</em> = 0.61 (<a href=""#T3"" class=""usa-link"">Table 3</a>, <a href=""#F6"" class=""usa-link"">Figure 6</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P51"">Publication bias was also assessed for each of these analyses. Funnel plots are displayed in <a href=""#SD1"" class=""usa-link"">Supplementary Figures 1</a>–<a href=""#SD1"" class=""usa-link"">5</a>. The funnel plots for the meta-analyses comparing STAI-T scores between individuals with an anxiety-related disorder and individuals with a depressive disorder, individuals with comorbid anxiety and depression and individuals with an anxiety-related disorder only, and individuals with comorbid anxiety and depression and individuals with a depressive disorder only were not asymmetrical, <em>p</em>s = .13–.31, suggesting that these meta-analyses were not significantly affected by publication bias (<a href=""#R53"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R53"">Egger et al., 1997</a>). Similarly, the funnel plots for the correlations between the STAI-T and measures of depression and measures of anxiety were not asymmetrical (<em>p</em>s = .22–.52). However, the meta-analyses comparing individuals with an anxiety-related disorder and individuals with a depressive disorder to nonclinical comparison groups were significantly asymmetrical (both <em>p</em>s &lt; .001).</p>"
"<p id=""P52"">The present meta-analysis showed that individuals with an anxiety-related disorder and those with a depressive disorder displayed significantly elevated scores on the STAI-T compared to nonclinical comparison groups. Furthermore, measures of depression and anxiety symptom severity were similarly strongly correlated with the STAI-T in these samples. These findings are consistent with research that has implicated trait anxiety in anxiety and depression (<a href=""#R3"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R3"">Andrews, 1991</a>; <a href=""#R127"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R127"">Rachman, 1998</a>; <a href=""#R170"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R170"">Weger &amp; Sandi, 2018</a>). Although the effect size was small, the present findings also showed that individuals with a depressive disorder had significantly higher STAI-T scores than individuals with an anxiety-related disorder. This finding is contrary to what would be expected if the STAI-T is to be considered a measure of the stable tendency to attend to, experience, and report fears, worries, and anxiety across many situations. Furthermore, the findings showed that comorbidity influenced differences in STAI-T scores. More specifically, individuals with comorbid anxiety and depression had higher STAI-T scores than individuals with either anxiety or depression alone. In particular, the addition of comorbid depression increased STAI-T scores for individuals with anxiety-related disorders, whereas the addition of comorbid anxiety did not affect STAI-T scores for individuals with depressive disorders.</p>"
"<p id=""P53"">The findings of the present meta-analysis suggest that the STAI-T may not exclusively measure trait anxiety as it purports to do but rather captures a higher-order trait such as negative affectivity/neuroticism that characterizes both anxiety and depression. For example, based on an extensive review of the literature, <a href=""#R102"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R102"">Mineka and colleagues (1998)</a> concluded that the DSM-IV mood and anxiety disorders contain a shared component representing “broad individual differences in general distress and Negative Affect; it is a pervasive higher order factor that is common to both the mood and anxiety disorders and is primarily responsible for the overlap among these disorders” (p. 397). Given factor analytic studies of the STAI that identify anxiety and depression factors (Bieling et al., 1998) and the wording of specific items that reflect depressive rather than anxious content (e.g., “I take disappointments so keenly that I can’t put them out of my mind”), the STAI-T appears to capture a broad negative affective vulnerability that may confer risk for both anxiety and depression.</p>"
"<p id=""P54"">Attempts to develop a valid measure of trait anxiety via self-report are not new; sixty years ago, there were at least 120 personality tests that purported to measure anxiety (<a href=""#R34"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R34"">Cattell &amp; Scheier, 1958</a>). Traits are descriptive and useful ways to categorize behavior, but psychometrically, they cannot be measured directly and are instead inferred from systematic covariation (<a href=""#R33"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R33"">Cattell, 1946</a>). Accordingly, concerns about validity are not unique to the STAI (<a href=""#R51"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R51"">Dobson, 1985</a>; <a href=""#R58"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R58"">Feldman, 1993</a>; <a href=""#R67"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R67"">Gotlib, 1984</a>). Indeed, many self-report scales of anxiety and depression suffer from similar psychometric limitations (<a href=""#R68"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R68"">Gotlib &amp; Cane, 1989</a>). However, due to its widespread use (see <a href=""#F2"" class=""usa-link"">Figure 2</a>), the STAI-T’s limited discriminant evidence of validity has important implications for the inferences made in the psychopathology literature. For example, many of the previously reviewed studies that discuss relations between trait anxiety and behavioral, cognitive, physiological, and neural processes may need to be reconceptualized. Given that the STAI-T appears to be a measure of negative affectivity/neuroticism, these studies demonstrate an association between various processes and negative affectivity/neuroticism more broadly rather than trait anxiety per se.</p>"
"<p id=""P55"">Although the STAI-T appears to be a measure of negative affect, it is important to note that it is imperfect in this regard as well. For example, the STAI-T does not appear to assess negative emotions other than anxiety and depression. Indeed, guilt, shame, disgust, and anger are all negative emotions, yet the items included in the STAI-T do not reflect these emotions. Other measures of negative affectivity/neuroticism, such as the Positive Affect and Negative Affect Scales (PANAS; <a href=""#R165"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R165"">Watson et al., 1988</a>), do include items assessing guilt, shame, hostility, and irritability and evince a moderate degree of stability and predictive power across a 6-year period in their trait form (<a href=""#R168"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R168"">Watson &amp; Walker, 1996</a>). Although the PANAS does not capture any behavioral, cognitive, or somatic correlates of affective experiences and strictly asks individuals to report to what extent they “generally” feel, it is clearly a more comprehensive measure of negative affect. In sum, the STAI-T lacks discriminant evidence of validity and thus is not an appropriate measure of trait anxiety. However, the STAI-T also underrepresents the construct of negative affect due to its limited scope.</p>"
"<p id=""P56"">If the STAI-T is better described as a measure of negative affect than trait anxiety, the findings of the present meta-analysis suggest that individuals with depressive disorders demonstrate higher trait negative affectivity than individuals with anxiety-related disorders. Although a meta-analysis examining personality traits and psychopathology did not find significantly higher negative affectivity/neuroticism in depression compared to anxiety-related disorders (<a href=""#R82"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R82"">Kotov et al., 2010</a>), symptoms of depression correlate more strongly with negative affectivity/neuroticism than symptoms of social anxiety, panic, agoraphobia, and specific phobia in other studies (<a href=""#R25"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R25"">Brown, 2007</a>; <a href=""#R26"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R26"">Brown et al., 1998</a>; <a href=""#R27"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R27"">Brown &amp; Naragon-Gainey, 2013</a>; <a href=""#R63"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R63"">Gamez et al., 2007</a>; <a href=""#R114"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R114"">Naragon-Gainey &amp; Watson, 2018</a>; <a href=""#R125"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R125"">Paulus et al., 2015</a>; <a href=""#R166"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R166"">Watson et al., 2005</a>). Notably, in studies examining negative affectivity/neuroticism and symptoms of psychopathology, GAD has stronger relations with negative affectivity/neuroticism than other anxiety-related disorders. In structural models of psychopathology, GAD loads onto a distress/anxious-misery factor along with MDD, dysthymia, and sometimes PTSD, whereas other anxiety disorders (panic disorder, agoraphobia, social anxiety disorder, and specific phobia) load onto a fear disorder factor (<a href=""#R83"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R83"">Krueger, 1999</a>; <a href=""#R160"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R160"">Vollebergh et al., 2001</a>; <a href=""#R163"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R163"">Watson, 2005</a>; <a href=""#R167"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R167"">Watson et al., 2008</a>; <a href=""#R178"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R178"">Wright et al., 2013</a>). In the present meta-analysis, studies comparing individuals with GAD to nonclinical comparison groups had a similar effect size as studies comparing individuals with depressive disorders and nonclinical comparison groups. Although these effect sizes cannot be directly compared<sup><a href=""#FN5"" class=""usa-link"">1</a></sup>, the 95% confidence interval of the effect size of the difference in STAI-T scores between individuals with a depressive disorder and nonclinical comparison groups overlaps with the 95% confidence interval for GAD as well as for social anxiety disorder, but not with the effect sizes for other anxiety-related disorders. A small number of studies (<em>k</em> = 7) were available directly comparing STAI-T scores between individuals with GAD and individuals with a depressive disorder; this effect size was small (Hedges’s <em>g</em> = −0.23) and did not reach significance (<em>p</em> = .26). A direct comparison of STAI-T scores between individuals with social anxiety disorder and individuals with a depressive disorder suggests that there is a small but significant difference in these groups’ mean STAI-T scores (<em>k</em> = 5, Hedges’s <em>g</em> = −0.45, <em>p</em> &lt; .001). Together, these results suggest that individuals with GAD and individuals with a depressive disorder do not differ in negative affectivity/neuroticism; individuals with social anxiety disorder have significantly lower negative affectivity/neuroticism than individuals with depression. These results are consistent with existing evidence that individuals with distress disorders have a higher level of negative affectivity compared to individuals with fear disorders.</p>"
"<p id=""P57"">Negative affectivity/neuroticism may be the core common feature of internalizing disorders, as demonstrated by findings from a large-scale study of adolescents that identified a single internalizing factor common to mood and anxiety-related disorder diagnostic status that correlated almost perfectly (<em>r</em> = .98) with a measure of neuroticism (<a href=""#R69"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R69"">Griffith et al., 2010</a>). Even though negative affectivity/neuroticism contributes a large proportion of symptom variance in structural models of psychopathology, the inclusion of measures of cognitive vulnerabilities may provide additional specificity and predictive power. Multiple candidates for specific cognitive vulnerability factors that may be either cumulative or synergistic with negative affectivity/neuroticism in structural models of psychopathology have been evaluated. For example, anxiety sensitivity and intolerance of uncertainty explained unique variance in OCD, social anxiety, and worry symptoms in an undergraduate sample (<a href=""#R118"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R118"">Norton &amp; Mehta, 2007</a>). Another study in an undergraduate sample found that specific cognitive vulnerabilities fully mediated the relation between negative affectivity/neuroticism and symptoms of psychopathology, including intolerance of uncertainty and ruminative style for depression and worry symptoms, and anxiety sensitivity for panic and social anxiety symptoms (<a href=""#R74"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R74"">Hong, 2013</a>). In a sample of treatment-seeking outpatients with anxiety and depressive disorders, negative affectivity/neuroticism explained a large portion of the variance in panic symptoms indirectly through anxiety sensitivity, and also explained a statistically significant portion of the variance in OCD, social anxiety, GAD, and depression indirectly through intolerance of uncertainty (<a href=""#R125"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R125"">Paulus et al., 2015</a>). A second study in a large clinical sample identified negative affectivity/neuroticism as a core biological vulnerability for internalizing disorders along with specific cognitive vulnerabilities, including perceived control for both GAD and OCD as well as thought-action fusion for OCD alone (<a href=""#R27"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R27"">Brown &amp; Naragon-Gainey, 2013</a>). Finally, a study of psychiatric outpatients found that although a model including higher-order negative affectivity/neuroticism and multiple lower-order cognitive vulnerabilities (anxiety sensitivity, intolerance of uncertainty, perfectionism, and experiential avoidance) fit the data, only anxiety sensitivity and perfectionism contributed significant variance to internalizing psychopathology, with the latter only specifically contributing variance in OCD<sup><a href=""#FN6"" class=""usa-link"">2</a></sup> (<a href=""#R114"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R114"">Naragon-Gainey &amp; Watson, 2018</a>). These results suggest that employing measures of specific cognitive vulnerabilities may have increment (or complement) negative affectivity/neuroticism when examining vulnerability factors for various forms of psychopathology.</p>"
"<p id=""P58"">The present meta-analysis also suggests that negative affectivity is higher in comorbid anxiety and depression compared to either anxiety or depression alone. Other studies have also found an association between increased negative affectivity/neuroticism and increased prevalence and number of comorbid disorders in MDD (<a href=""#R77"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R77"">Jylh et al., 2009</a>; <a href=""#R179"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R179"">Xia et al. 2011</a>), and a previous study of individuals with anxiety and depressive disorders demonstrated a trend toward increased comorbidity with increased negative affectivity/neuroticism (<a href=""#R19"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R19"">Bienvenu et al., 2001</a>). The nature of comorbidity within anxiety and depression has been extensively examined, and negative affectivity/neuroticism likely accounts for much of this overlap, as individuals high in negative affectivity are more likely to experience high levels of multiple negative emotions (<a href=""#R102"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R102"">Mineka et al., 1998</a>; <a href=""#R163"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R163"">Watson, 2005</a>). The present study suggests that depressive disorders are associated with higher negative affectivity than anxiety-related disorders; thus, increased comorbid depression in an anxious sample leads to significantly higher STAI-T scores, whereas the addition of comorbid anxiety in a depressive disorder sample does not have a statistically significant effect on STAI-T scores.</p>"
"<p id=""P59"">Importantly, though individuals with depressive disorders endorsed a small but significantly higher mean level of negative affect than individuals with anxiety-related disorders, the STAI-T correlated equally strongly with anxiety and depressive symptom severity. That is, while there was a strong relationship between overall symptom severity and STAI-T scores within these clinical samples, the relationship between STAI-T scores and anxiety symptom severity did not differ from the relationship between STAI-T scores and depressive symptom severity. Although there were fewer studies included in the correlational analyses compared to the diagnostic comparisons, observed power (&gt; 0.99) was still sufficient to detect small differences in the relationship between negative affect and anxiety and depressive symptoms.</p>"
"<p id=""P60"">Statistically significant moderators of the difference in STAI-T scores between clinically anxious and depressed individuals and nonclinical comparison groups were also detected. For instance, gender moderated the difference in STAI-T scores between nonclinical comparison groups and individuals with GAD and OCD, with samples with a higher percentage of women having higher STAI-T scores than nonclinical comparison groups. In nonclinical normative samples, women tended to have higher scores than men on the STAI-T (<a href=""#R146"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R146"">Spielberger et al., 1983</a>); a meta-analysis of cross-cultural gender differences in personality traits among nonclinical individuals found that women tended to score significantly higher on measures of negative affectivity/neuroticism compared to men (<a href=""#R138"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R138"">Schmitt et al., 2008</a>). For both GAD and OCD, women are more likely than men to meet criteria for comorbid depression (<a href=""#R72"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R72"">Hallion et al., 2015</a>; <a href=""#R158"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R158"">Vesga-López et al., 2008</a>), which may account for higher reported negative affect as indexed by the STAI-T. However, it is unclear why higher negative affect would only be found for women with GAD and OCD, but not for women with other anxiety-related or depressive disorders. Similarly, age effects were not detected at the broad categorical level but did emerge for specific disorders. In studies comparing individuals with panic disorder and individuals with major depressive disorder with nonclinical comparison groups, as mean participant age increased, the difference in STAI-T scores between the clinical and nonclinical groups decreased. However, in specific phobia, older individuals had higher STAI-T scores compared to nonclinical comparison groups than younger individuals. It is unclear why this pattern would be reversed in individuals with specific phobia; it is possible that individuals whose specific phobias persist into later adulthood are more likely to be generally anxious than individuals whose specific phobias resolve earlier in life. Among older adults, individuals with current specific phobia had higher rates of comorbid depression and other anxiety-related disorders than older individuals without specific phobia, but this study did not compare older and younger adults with specific phobia (<a href=""#R37"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R37"">Chou, 2009</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P61"">Lastly, studies conducted in the United States tended to have larger differences in STAI-T scores between clinically anxious and depressed individuals and nonclinical comparison groups compared to most other regions, especially non-English-speaking countries. Importantly, these cross-national variations in negative affect may not be attributable to cross-national differences in the nature or validity of negative affect (<a href=""#R139"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R139"">Simon et al., 2002</a>), as all studies used the STAI-T. Accordingly, using the STAI-T may be revealing different levels of negative affect in different countries. Coupled with recent research showing that some forms of negative affect have significantly increased in the United States (<a href=""#R171"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R171"">Weinberger et al., 2018</a>), the present findings suggest that there may be utility in programmatic research designed to better understanding the macro-level, micro-level, and individual factors that are contributing to increased negative affect in the United States compared to other countries.</p>"
"<p id=""P62"">The present findings also show that studies using Form Y of the STAI demonstrate larger effects for individuals with anxiety-related disorders compared to nonclinical comparison groups than studies that used Form X, but no differences were found when comparing individuals with depressive disorders and nonclinical comparison groups. This finding supports the use of the revised Form Y and demonstrates its increased specificity to detect anxiety compared to Form X. There were no statistically significant moderators in the meta-regression model comparing individuals with anxiety-related disorders to individuals with depressive disorders, though these analyses may have been limited due to a smaller number of studies that conducted these direct comparisons.</p>"
"<p id=""P63"">Evidence that traits, or at minimum the behavioral manifestations of traits, can change over the lifespan has influenced the conceptualization and treatment of personality disorders (<a href=""#R39"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R39"">Clark, 2009</a>). If traits can change over time, perhaps traits that influence anxiety and depression are malleable to treatment. Pharmacological research has found that antidepressant medication leads to significant changes in emotional temperament, which subsequently affect changes at the symptom level (<a href=""#R142"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R142"">Soskin et al., 2012</a>). More specifically, a population-based cohort study in Finland found a small but statistically significant decrease in STAI-T scores over a seven- to ten-year period for individuals taking an antidepressant (<a href=""#R111"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R111"">Nabi et al., 2013</a>). Multiple psychotherapy studies also demonstrate reductions in STAI-T for patients undergoing treatment. In a review of six studies, <a href=""#R60"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R60"">Fisher and Durham (1999)</a> found that GAD patients’ STAI-T scores consistently decreased after a variety of therapeutic approaches to treatment (anxiety management training, analytical psychotherapy, behavior therapy, cognitive therapy, and non-directive therapy), though the strongest effects were found for individuals receiving cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or applied relaxation. More recent studies have found statistically significant decreases in STAI-T scores for GAD patients receiving CBT (<a href=""#R115"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R115"">Newman et al., 2011</a>) and meta-cognitive therapy (<a href=""#R173"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R173"">Wells et al., 2010</a>), with reductions maintained over one- to two-year follow-up. In a sample of individuals with heterogenous anxiety-related disorders, STAI-T scores significantly decreased after mindfulness-based stress reduction, and this decrease was maintained at six-month follow-up (<a href=""#R161"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R161"">Vøllestad et al., 2011</a>). Taken together, these results show that STAI-T scores are malleable, which would suggest that negative affectivity/neuroticism does respond to treatment.</p>"
"<p id=""P64"">Although negative affectivity/neuroticism decreases after psychological and pharmacological interventions, few treatments directly target this this trait. However, <a href=""#R11"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R11"">Barlow and colleagues (2014)</a> have suggested that psychological interventions should specifically target negative affectivity/neuroticism, rather than features of emotional disorders such as anxiety and depression. The Unified Protocol (UP) for the Treatment of Mental Disorders was developed with this goal in mind. Initial evidence suggests that this treatment can reduce negative affectivity/neuroticism compared to a waitlist control group, and this decrease in negative affectivity/neuroticism predicted decreases in anxiety and depressive symptoms and functional impairment (Carl et al., 2013). Although head-to-head tests of the protocol compared to other treatments will be needed to demonstrate any relative strengths of the UP in decreasing negative affectivity/neuroticism, these results demonstrate promise that psychological interventions can effectively target negative affectivity, and the STAI-T may be a useful outcome measure in such studies.</p>"
"<p id=""P65"">The results of these meta-analyses must be considered in light of several limitations. First, although direct comparisons between individuals with anxiety and depressive disorders and correlational examinations between the STAI-T and measures of anxiety and depression were robust to publication bias according to several applied metrics (funnel plot inspection and fail-safe N’s), comparisons of STAI-T scores between nonclinical comparison groups and individuals with anxiety-related disorders and with individuals with depressive disorders had significantly asymmetric funnel plots. <a href=""#R52"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R52"">Egger et al. (1998)</a> have suggested that funnel plots are less useful in observational meta-analyses due to the extensive degree of heterogeneity between studies that may affect the results. Funnel plots are typically used as a depiction of publication bias, but they actually depict small-study effects (<a href=""#R149"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R149"">Sterne et al., 2000</a>). It is possible that the sampling of the nonclinical comparison group varied systematically between large and small studies; for example, larger studies may have conducted less rigorous screening of nonclinical comparison groups due to the substantial time these procedures may take in large samples, whereas smaller neuroimaging studies may have nonclinical comparison groups that were precisely matched and screened to exclude any history of anxiety or depression. Given that the STAI-T was not the main outcome reported in the vast majority of these studies, but rather included as part of the descriptive statistics of the samples, it is unlikely that these asymmetrical funnel plots are due to a bias toward publishing statistically significant results, as might be the case in meta-analyses comparing the effects of interventions. Additionally, the fail-safe <em>N</em>’s for both meta-analyses are extremely large (<a href=""#T1"" class=""usa-link"">Tables 1</a> and <a href=""#T3"" class=""usa-link"">3</a>), suggesting that a huge number of studies with nonsignificant differences in STAI-T scores between clinically anxious or depressed individuals and nonclinical comparison groups would need to be missing from the present analyses in order for the estimated effect sizes to be nonsignificant.</p>"
"<p id=""P66"">Although a large number of studies were included in the present meta-analyses, some analyses included a small number of studies. In particular, <a href=""#R59"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R59"">Field (2001)</a> suggests that meta-analyses of correlation coefficients should be conducted only when there are 30 samples or more due to the degree of heterogeneity among the studies and inflated Type I error rate. The correlational meta-analyses conducted in the present study contained 12 and 15 samples, largely because these studies were limited to individuals with clinically diagnosed anxiety and/or depression. Multiple large-scale studies have been conducted demonstrating stronger correlations between the STAI-T and measures of depression than between the STAI-T and measures of anxiety in nonclinical samples (<a href=""#R6"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R6"">Bados et al., 2010</a>; Balsamo et al., 2013). However, future research could extend this work by using a meta-analytic approach to examine correlations among the STAI-T and measures of anxiety and depression in both clinical and nonclinical samples.</p>"
"<p id=""P67"">Other study sampling limitations may have affected the results of this meta-analytic review. For example, unpublished studies and dissertations were not included. Additionally, only peer-reviewed studies published in English were included. Because region was a statistically significant moderator of the differences in STAI-T scores between clinical and nonclinical groups, it is likely that the inclusion of studies published in languages other than English may have influenced the findings. It is unclear whether these regional differences are due to differences in translations of the STAI-T or due to true population-level differences. Although the present meta-analysis is strengthened by the examination of multiple potential moderators, some studies did not include information regarding comorbidity, medication use, or the form of the STAI-T used, which prevented testing of multiple moderators within a single meta-regression model. In addition, the racial and ethnic identities of participants were usually not reported, precluding analysis of these potentially important moderators.</p>"
"<p id=""P68"">Finally, a number of other unmeasured variables (IQ, genetic background/family history, previous mental health history) could have impacted these results. Such variables were often not included in the studies used in the present meta-analyses. Further investigation into the effects of these various factors on scores on the STAI may be warranted. In addition, due to the meta-analytic techniques employed in the present study, other methods of assessing a measure’s psychometric properties could not be used, such as the use of informant reports or social desirability scales or examinations of concordance with behavioral and psychophysiological measures. There is much left to understand about the construct of trait anxiety as a whole, but the existing evidence suggests that the STAI-T may not be a valid measure of trait anxiety.</p>"
"<p id=""P69"">Despite the study limitations, the present findings have important implications for future research. The deeply established research background of the STAI suggests that this measure will not fade into obscurity. Indeed, the existence of thousands of studies that provide comparative STAI-T scores in varied populations is informative and should not be discarded. However, future studies that use the STAI-T must consider the measure in light of the available validity evidence. Studies that choose to employ the STAI-T must be careful to specify that the measure reflects trait negative affectivity/neuroticism, rather than trait anxiety. Researchers that are interested in the construct of trait anxiety as a measure of individual differences in the predisposition to experience fear, worry, and anxiety should consider measures such as the STICSA (<a href=""#R70"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R70"">Grös et al., 2007</a>) that have better discriminant evidence of validity with measures of depression.</p>"
"<p id=""P70"">These findings suggest that trait anxiety may be a clinically meaningful construct that is in search of a more valid measure. Although the STAI-T cannot be considered a valid, specific measure of trait anxiety, these results do not diminish the value of the construct. Earlier, we defined trait anxiety as “an individual’s tendency to appraise situations as threatening, avoid anxiety-provoking situations, and demonstrate high baseline physiological arousal,” based on Elwood and colleagues’ review of the measurement and correlates of anxious traits (<a href=""#R54"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R54"">Elwood et al., 2012</a>). There is utility in examining this pattern of responding to and preparing for threat separately from the tendency to experience negative emotions. The National Institute of Mental Health’s Research Domain Criteria (RDoC; <a href=""#R75"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R75"">Insel et al., 2010</a>; <a href=""#R136"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R136"">Sanislow et al., 2010</a>) provide one avenue by which to consider the measurement of trait anxiety. In the RDoC matrix, anxiety is referred to as Potential Threat:
</p>"
"<p id=""P71"">Activation of a brain system in which harm may potentially occur but is distant, ambiguous, or low/uncertain in probability, characterized by a pattern of responses such as enhanced risk assessment (vigilance). These responses to low imminence threats are qualitatively different than the high imminence threat behaviors that characterize fear (<a href=""https://www.nimh.nih.gov/research/research-funded-by-nimh/rdoc/constructs/potential-threat-anxiety.shtml"" class=""usa-link"" data-ga-action=""click_feat_suppl"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://www.nimh.nih.gov/research/research-funded-by-nimh/rdoc/constructs/potential-threat-anxiety.shtml</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P72"">The RDoC matrix was specifically created to examine potential mechanisms underlying psychopathology. It aims to study psychological constructs across multiple levels of analysis, including self-report, neural circuits, and physiological responses to established paradigms. Self-report measures of Potential Threat included in the RDoC matrix assess anxiety sensitivity, fear of negative evaluation, intolerance of uncertainty, and behavioral inhibition, as well as responses to stressful life events. Hierarchical measures of anxiety (<a href=""#R30"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R30"">Carleton, 2016</a>; <a href=""#R91"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R91"">Lilienfeld et al., 1993</a>; <a href=""#R121"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R121"">Olatunji &amp; Wolitzky-Taylor, 2009</a>) suggest that these are lower-order factors nested under trait anxiety, which itself is subsumed under negative affectivity/neuroticism. Although these measures are useful in examining specific aspects of responses to Potential Threat, there is not yet a valid measure that captures an individual’s overall trait responsivity to Potential Threat. Even the STICSA, which has better discriminant evidence of validity than the STAI-T, does not directly assess an individual’s typical response to Potential Threat. The STICSA contains questions that assess cognitive and somatic aspects of anxiety in reference to an individual’s “general mood state,” such as “My heart beats fast” and “I can’t get some thought out of my mind” (<a href=""#R70"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R70"">Grös et al., 2007</a>), but it does not ask individuals to reflect on how they evaluate or respond to potential threats in their environment. A comprehensive self-report measure of potential threat would include items about hypervigilance, checking behavior, freezing, and repetitive thinking in the context of uncertain situations. Informant reports would also be useful, especially when examining the responses of children or for individuals who have limited insight into their own thoughts and behavior in uncertain, potentially threatening situations.</p>"
"<p id=""P73"">Potential Threat is unlikely to be fully captured or understood based on self-reported measures alone. Behavioral tasks that can assess in vivo behavior in ecologically valid, potentially threatening situations are also needed. Theories of trait anxiety and responses to Potential Threat should integrate available evidence from genetic, neurobiological, psychophysiological, and behavioral research along with self- and informant reports for a more complete understanding of this construct. In one such model, <a href=""#R170"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R170"">Weger and Sandi (2018)</a> propose a stress-diathesis model that demonstrates how trait anxiety can lead to depression, integrating genetic and epigenetic risk factors identified through animal and human research with an understanding of the impacts of environmental conditions and stress. In suboptimal environmental conditions, individuals may be more likely to employ maladaptive behavioral strategies to cope with stress, leading to the development of anxiety and depression. For example, an individual with a biological predisposition toward trait anxiety raised in a highly stressful environment with a lack of parental support or modeling of effective coping is more likely to develop an anxiety-related disorder compared to an individual with a similar biological predisposition raised in a lower stress environment with supportive, non-accommodating parents. However, this model does not distinguish between contexts and strategies that predispose an individual to developing anxiety vs. depression. <a href=""#F1"" class=""usa-link"">Figure 1</a> outlines one potential pathway from maladaptive coping strategies to clinically significant anxiety, with an emphasis on relevant cognitive biases and maladaptive behavioral strategies. Such integrative models outline the proposed pathway from high trait anxiety to the development and maintenance of anxiety-related psychopathology and suggest the Potential Threat framework to guide future multimodal research on trait anxiety.</p>"

"<p>The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) poses a huge challenge to global public health. People with schizophrenia living in communities urgently need effective interventions to help them adjust to life and work, but they have not received enough attention. This study aims to assess the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms in community-dwelling patients with schizophrenia in China during the epidemic and to explore the possible influencing factors. Methods: Using a cross-sectional survey, we collected 15,165 questionnaires. Assessments included demographic information, concern about COVID-19-related information, sleep status, anxiety and depressive symptoms, and accompanying illnesses. The 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) and the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) were used to evaluate depression and anxiety levels. Group comparison was conducted by <em>t</em>-test, ANOVA, or chi-square test wherever suitable, with Bonferroni pairwise correction. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify predictors for anxiety and depression. Results: 16.9% of patients had at least moderate anxiety, and 34.9% had at least moderate depression. <em>T</em>-test showed that females scored higher on GAD-7 and PHQ-9 than males, and patients without accompanying long-standing diseases, who were not concerned about COVID-19, had lower GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scores. ANOVA showed that participants aged from 30 to 39, with higher education scored higher on GAD-7, and patients with better sleep, and having less concern about COVID-19, had lower GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scores. Regression analysis indicated that participant ages of 30–39 and 40–49 positively predicted anxiety, whereas patient ages of 30–39 years positively predicted depression. Patients with poor sleep, accompanying diseases, and concern about the COVID-19 pandemic were more likely to experience anxiety and depression. Conclusion: During the pandemic, Chinese community-dwelling patients with schizophrenia had high rates of anxiety and depression. These patients deserve clinical attention and psychological intervention, especially those with risk factors.</p>"

"<p>The discovery and rapid spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) brought huge challenges to the public health and medical communities around the world [<a href=""#B1-ijerph-20-04376"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B1-ijerph-20-04376"">1</a>]. The health effects of this virus are worrisome, including death, a strained healthcare system and economic uncertainty. Likewise, the epidemic may have devastating psychological and social effects [<a href=""#B2-ijerph-20-04376"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B2-ijerph-20-04376"">2</a>]. Numerous studies assessed the mental health of the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic [<a href=""#B3-ijerph-20-04376"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B3-ijerph-20-04376"">3</a>,<a href=""#B4-ijerph-20-04376"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B4-ijerph-20-04376"">4</a>], but there was insufficient research on the emotional impact of schizophrenia patients during the epidemic.</p>"
"<p>It was reported that patients with schizophrenia had a significantly increased risk of contracting COVID-19 compared to the normal population [<a href=""#B5-ijerph-20-04376"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B5-ijerph-20-04376"">5</a>]. High-risk factors included failure to properly recognize self-protection needs and to adhere to preventive behaviors due to impaired cognitive function [<a href=""#B6-ijerph-20-04376"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B6-ijerph-20-04376"">6</a>], difficulties in evaluating health information, limitations in access to healthcare [<a href=""#B7-ijerph-20-04376"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B7-ijerph-20-04376"">7</a>], and being easily influenced by the ongoing media coverage of the epidemic [<a href=""#B8-ijerph-20-04376"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B8-ijerph-20-04376"">8</a>]. Compared with inpatients, community-dwelling patients with schizophrenia lack full-time management of medical care, so community and family support need to play a better role [<a href=""#B9-ijerph-20-04376"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B9-ijerph-20-04376"">9</a>]. Therefore, it is necessary to assess the mental health burden of patients with schizophrenia during the COVID-19 pandemic and provide timely community and family support.</p>"
"<p>Several studies conducted in China in 2020 showed that hospitalized schizophrenic patients with suspected COVID-19 in isolation wards experienced sleep disturbances, significantly higher scores on depression and anxiety scales, and increased stress compared to general hospitalized schizophrenic patients [<a href=""#B10-ijerph-20-04376"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B10-ijerph-20-04376"">10</a>,<a href=""#B11-ijerph-20-04376"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B11-ijerph-20-04376"">11</a>]. In addition, hospitalized patients with schizophrenia with suspected COVID-19 were reassessed as having significantly increased anxiety symptoms after 10–14 days of isolation [<a href=""#B11-ijerph-20-04376"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B11-ijerph-20-04376"">11</a>].</p>"
"<p>Although community-dwelling patients with schizophrenia did not have as narrow and limited social network connections as long-term hospitalized patients [<a href=""#B12-ijerph-20-04376"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B12-ijerph-20-04376"">12</a>], they were relatively underreported during the epidemic. A study shows that many community schizophrenia patients, despite being stable, still have some psychiatric symptoms that affect their lives to some extent [<a href=""#B12-ijerph-20-04376"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B12-ijerph-20-04376"">12</a>,<a href=""#B13-ijerph-20-04376"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B13-ijerph-20-04376"">13</a>]. An outpatient health study showed that only about 25% of patients with schizophrenia achieved functional remission during the 3-year follow-up period [<a href=""#B14-ijerph-20-04376"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B14-ijerph-20-04376"">14</a>]. Community-dwelling patients with schizophrenia are in urgent need of effective intervention methods to help them adjust to life and work during a pandemic. Therefore, we intended to explore the psychological burden of community-dwelling patients with schizophrenia during the pandemic. One study showed that community-dwelling patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder experienced more severe anxiety and depressive symptoms during the urban lockdown compared to community healthy controls [<a href=""#B15-ijerph-20-04376"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B15-ijerph-20-04376"">15</a>]. However, the report did not analyze anxiety and depressive symptoms separately in patients with schizophrenia during the outbreak. A Spanish study showed that compared to the control group, community-dwelling patients with schizophrenia (<em>n</em> = 42) experienced significantly higher scores in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale Anxiety (HADS-A) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale Depression (HADS-D) during the COVID-19 pandemic [<a href=""#B16-ijerph-20-04376"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B16-ijerph-20-04376"">16</a>]. Moreover, 40.8% of community-dwelling patients with schizophrenia (<em>n</em> = 76) reported depression and 32.9% reported anxiety [<a href=""#B17-ijerph-20-04376"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B17-ijerph-20-04376"">17</a>]. Overall, current research on depression and anxiety in community-dwelling schizophrenics during the epidemic period is insufficient, and inadequate sample sizes are a shortcoming.</p>"
"<p>Given the evolving and unpredictable duration of COVID-19, using a cross-sectional, web-based and large sample study, the first objective of this study was to examine the mental health burden of community-dwelling patients with schizophrenia during the COVID-19 outbreak, and the second objective was to analyze potential influencing factors. This study assessed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis on the mental health of community-dwelling patients with schizophrenia. A study of community-dwelling patients with schizophrenia would help provide effective psychological screening and interventions. We hypothesized that community-dwelling patients with schizophrenia during the COVID-19 pandemic had varying degrees of anxiety and depressive symptoms, and that middle age, poor sleep, concerns about epidemic information, and concomitant other long-standing illnesses would have an impact on depression and anxiety.</p>"

<p>Theoretical Framework.</p>
"<p>In our study, sleep status refers to the sleep level of the subjects during the past 12 months. If the sleep status was good most of the year, a better status is recorded, and if the sleep status was bad most of the year, the status “poor” is chosen. Poor sleep includes sleep problems such as difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep.

"<p>This study consists of 2 parts. The first part contains demographic data and some other information, including sleep status, and other accompanying long-standing diseases, and concerns about COVID-19. We defined “ long-term diseases “ and explained “ sleep status” and “concerns about COVID-19” above, in the literature review. The options all have 2–3 simple categories. The second part of the questionnaire, which is the main part of our study, contains the Depression Scale and the Anxiety Scale, which are widely used scales for measuring depression and anxiety worldwide [<a href=""#B29-ijerph-20-04376"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B29-ijerph-20-04376"">29</a>]. The research questionnaire is in <a href=""#app1-ijerph-20-04376"" class=""usa-link"">Supplementary Materials File S1</a>. In addition, a pilot test was conducted to ensure that participants understood the purpose and content of the questionnaire before it was widely distributed.

"<p>The 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) was adopted to assess the severity of self-reported anxiety [<a href=""#B31-ijerph-20-04376"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B31-ijerph-20-04376"">31</a>]. It is composed of 7 items to evaluate how often over the past two weeks the patient has suffered from various issues, such as “difficulty in relaxing” or “excessive worry”. Response categories are “not at all”, “several days”, “more than one week”, and “nearly every day”, scored as 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The total score of the GAD-7 is calculated by summing each item score. The total score ranges from 0 to 21, with a score of 5 indicating that the patient has anxiety. A score of 5, 10 or 15 represents the threshold for “mild”, “moderate” or “severe” anxiety, respectively. Studies showed that the scale has good internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = 0.92), and the test-retest reliability coefficient was 0.83. When the decomposition value was 10 points, the sensitivity was 89% and the specificity was 82% [<a href=""#B32-ijerph-20-04376"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B32-ijerph-20-04376"">32</a>].

"<p>The 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), also with good reliability and validity, was employed to screen depressive disorder and measure the severity of symptoms [<a href=""#B33-ijerph-20-04376"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B33-ijerph-20-04376"">33</a>]. PHQ-9 is made up of 9 items to evaluate how often over the past two weeks the patient has suffered from nine issues, including depressed mood and anhedonia. Response categories are “not at all”, “several days”, “more than one week”, and “nearly every day”, scored as 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The total score ranges from 0 to 27, with a score of 5 indicating that the patient has depression. A score of 5, 10, 15 or 20 represents the threshold for “mild”, “moderate”, “severe” or “extremely severe” depression, respectively. Nine items of PHQ-9 include anhedonia, depressed mood, sleep disturbance, fatigue, appetite changes, low self-esteem, concentration problems, psychomotor disturbances, and suicidal ideation. In this study, we conducted a reliability analysis yielding Cronbach’s α = 0.897. In the validity analysis, KMO = 0.926 and Bartlett’s Test of Sphericity &lt;0.001.

"<p>This cross-sectional questionnaire was conducted in a prefecture-level city in Hangzhou, China from April 7 to May 10, 2020. According to the local area division, the city has 13 districts, counties (cities) and 2 functional areas.

"<p>We designed the content of the questionnaire. Patients with schizophrenia living in the communities under their respective management were contacted by physicians engaged in the prevention and treatment of mental illness in each district, county, and prefecture through telephone, home visits, and outpatient clinics, and the questionnaires were completed online by the physicians after obtaining patient information. Prior to the start of the study, local physicians were trained with detailed information on the questionnaire items and quality control of data collection.

"<p>Data analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics software version 19.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA). Categorical data were described by the case numbers (percentage) and quantitative data as mean score ± S.D. Group comparison was conducted by <em>t</em>-test, ANOVA, or chi-square test wherever suitable, and pairwise comparison was conducted by Bonferroni test. In order to look for the score differences of PHQ-9 and GAD-7, patients with schizophrenia were grouped into six sub-groups by demographic and clinical status, namely sex, age, marital status, educational level, sleep status, and other accompanying long-standing diseases. Multivariate logistic regression models were performed to identify independent predictors for anxiety and depression, respectively. GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scores were first transformed into binary variables with the threshold of moderate anxiety or depression and then served as dependent variables in the respective regression models. Anxiety was divided into mild anxiety and moderate and above anxiety; moderate and above anxiety was defined as a patient with a score of &gt;9. Depression was divided into mild depression and moderate and above depression; moderate and above depression was defined as a patient with a score of &gt;9. Sex, age, marital status, educational level, sleep status, other accompanying long-standing diseases, concern about COVID-19, and the degree of concern about COVID-19 served as independent variables. Statistical significance was set at a two-sided <em>p</em>-value &lt; 0.05.</p>"
"<p>The completed questionnaire data were entered into an SPSS file. Since the management of schizophrenia in the community is systematically standardized, with specific community physicians managing regular patients over time, and maintaining follow-up visits and follow-up, subjects who agreed to be enrolled provided valid and complete data. There were no missing values and no outliers were found in this study. We performed validation factor analysis to test the reliability and validity of the depression scale and anxiety scale in this study. This study wanted to explore the potential influences that affect patients with schizophrenia presenting moderate and higher levels of depression and anxiety, consistent with exploring the relationship between dichotomous dependent variables and independent variables, so a dichotomous logistic regression model was used for analysis. Previous studies have shown that roughly 80% of patients with schizophrenia have reported depression [<a href=""#B34-ijerph-20-04376"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B34-ijerph-20-04376"">34</a>]. Although there was an increase in the proportion in the present findings, patients have been receiving regular attention to mood changes from community healthcare providers during routine management of the illness, and mild depression has less impact compared to moderate and higher depression. However, some studies have shown that patients with moderate depression are at significantly increased risk for suicide [<a href=""#B35-ijerph-20-04376"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B35-ijerph-20-04376"">35</a>] and that major depressive disorder is a significant factor in suicide in patients with schizophrenia [<a href=""#B36-ijerph-20-04376"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B36-ijerph-20-04376"">36</a>]. In addition, some studies have shown that the worsening of anxiety symptoms is a strong predictor of medication switching during treatment, suggesting that severe anxiety enhances the adverse effects of treatment management [<a href=""#B37-ijerph-20-04376"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B37-ijerph-20-04376"">37</a>]. Therefore, we prefer to explore the potential influences affecting moderate and higher levels of anxiety and depression, which certainly does not make us neglect to focus on patients with mild depression and anxiety.</p>"
"<p>Among 15,165 cases of patients with schizophrenia, the mean score of GAD-7 and PHQ-9 were 8.1 ± 2.1 and 10.4 ± 2.7, respectively, and the prevalence of anxiety and depression was 100%. The proportion with mild anxiety was 83.2%, moderate anxiety accounted for 15.7%, and 1.2% had severe anxiety. Meanwhile, 65.1% of participants had minimal symptoms of depression, the moderate depression rate was 25.7%, the proportion with severe depression was 8.2%, and 1.0% had extremely serious depression.

Good sleep (OR:0.23; 95% CI [0.19, 0.28]; <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001) can reduce the risk of anxiety. Meanwhile, patients aged 30–39 (OR:1.23; 95% CI [1.09, 1.38]; <em>p</em> = 0.001), with other accompanying long-standing diseases (OR:1.29; 95% CI [1.18, 1.42]; <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001), who were concerned about the COVID-19 pandemic (OR:1.49; 95% CI [1.34, 1.64]; <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001) were more likely to experience depression. Good sleep (OR:0.26; 95% CI [0.22, 0.31]; <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001) can reduce the risk of depression. Other independent variables are non-significant predictors in the logistic regression model for anxiety and depression (<a href=""#ijerph-20-04376-t004"" class=""usa-link"">Table 4</a>).

"<p>15,165 cases of community-dwelling patients with schizophrenia in this survey all had mild to severe anxiety and depression, which is supported by previous research.

Previous studies showed that during the COVID-19 pandemic, people aged 30–49 had higher scores on epidemic knowledge and paid more attention to epidemic information, which may increase the risk of depression and anxiety [<a href=""#B38-ijerph-20-04376"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B38-ijerph-20-04376"">38</a>].

When the COVID-19 pandemic occurred, the situation changed. The epidemic posed a serious threat to patients’ children and families. The consequences of these difficulties may be long-term, partly because environmental risks penetrate the structure and process of the family system [<a href=""#B47-ijerph-20-04376"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B47-ijerph-20-04376"">47</a>], while the patients’ partners can take more risks together, so as to reduce the pressure of the patient.

"<p>We found patients with schizophrenia accompanied by other long-standing diseases were at higher risk of anxiety and depression. A Turkish study showed that the general population with chronic diseases will be more seriously affected by depression and anxiety symptoms, and that other accompanying chronic diseases was a risk factor for anxiety.

"<p>The GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scores of community-dwelling patients with schizophrenia who were concerned about COVID-19 were higher than those who did not express concern. Besides, the group comparison above showed that the anxiety and depression symptoms of patients with general concern about the epidemic were more serious than those with less or more concern. For the first result, this may be because patients who did not express concern about COVID-19 at all could not understand the severity of the epidemic, and were less worried about the health problems of the epidemic, which led to insignificant anxiety and depression symptoms. For those who were occasionally concerned about the epidemic, aware of the methods of controlling infectious diseases including risk communication, hygiene habits, social distancing, and believing that vaccines were safe and effective [<a href=""#B56-ijerph-20-04376"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B56-ijerph-20-04376"">56</a>], their anxiety and depression were naturally reduced. Patients who were moderately concerned but not thoroughly concerned about the outbreak experienced the most severe symptoms of depression and anxiety, probably because they were not ignorant, but overwhelmed by seeing more information on COVID-19 [<a href=""#B40-ijerph-20-04376"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B40-ijerph-20-04376"">40</a>]. Some of the information or relevant knowledge they obtained may have been superficial, especially in uncertain periods. Conspiracy theories and rumors were particularly popular during the pandemic. For example, some people saw many rumors but did not further obtain rumor refutation information. Social media may be double-sided as an information source under the influence of some people [<a href=""#B56-ijerph-20-04376"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B56-ijerph-20-04376"">56</a>]. Since the information obtained by patients was too much but not in-depth enough and true information could not be distinguished from false, patients were more likely to feel a lack of control, producing more serious anxiety and depression.</p>"
"<p>This was the first study to investigate the psychological burden of community-dwelling patients with schizophrenia with a large sample during the COVID-19 epidemic. The study showed that anxiety and depression symptoms of different degrees generally appeared in community schizophrenia during the epidemic period, which confirmed that the epidemic had a certain impact on the mental health of patients. In addition, we found that in the current study, the 30–39 age group, sleeping poorly, having other accompanying long-standing diseases, and concern about COVID-19 were risk factors for anxiety or depression. Besides, patients with general concerns about COVID-19 had more severe symptoms of depression and anxiety. Living with a partner was a protective factor for depression in male patients.</p>"
"<p>As our findings showed, patients with schizophrenia had obvious psychological stress responses such as anxiety and depression during the epidemic. Previous research has shown that pandemics can lead to unemployment and family poverty, separation of family members, and social isolation [<a href=""#B56-ijerph-20-04376"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B56-ijerph-20-04376"">56</a>]. At the same time, the number of patients being screened for safety reasons decreases, and individuals with psychiatric symptoms may have difficulty accessing medical assistance [<a href=""#B55-ijerph-20-04376"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B55-ijerph-20-04376"">55</a>]. Therefore, we need to focus on the mental health of patients in a timely and adequate manner. These patients are at risk of experiencing more severe consequences after stimulation, such as worsening of psychiatric symptoms and disease relapse [<a href=""#B57-ijerph-20-04376"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B57-ijerph-20-04376"">57</a>]. Community grassroots medical staff and members of care and rescue groups need to focus on follow-up and emotional counseling for patients with the above characteristics. For example, patients with the above characteristics should be surveyed with a higher frequency of questionnaires to understand their emotional state in time. In serious cases, medication and psychological intervention should be carried out. In addition, community workers need to guide patients to correctly understand COVID-19 and reduce unnecessary concerns. Moreover, primary medical staff need to pay more attention to the sleep status of schizophrenia patients in the community, including drug adjustment and behavioral intervention. Finally, it is important to actively treat other concomitant diseases of patients with schizophrenia. Of course, this mental health program should not increase the burden on healthcare providers or the risk of spreading the infection to others [<a href=""#B56-ijerph-20-04376"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B56-ijerph-20-04376"">56</a>].</p>"
"<p>This survey also has certain limitations. First, due to the special period of epidemic prevention and control, the patient’s mental health questionnaire survey was delivered by home visits, telephone calls, outpatient clinics, etc. Different delivery forms may cause misunderstandings and inaccuracy of the results. Although physicians had unified the standards for questionnaire interviews, different transmission forms may still cause misunderstandings and inaccurate results. In this study, telephone or face-to-face interviews were used. Face-to-face communication may help patients understand better than phone conversations, and the results obtained would be relatively more accurate. Second, in order to obtain patient information conveniently, all results were derived from self-report scales; although physicians tried their best to explain the items, this could still lead to biases in patients’ recall. Third, this study was mainly based on the evaluation of patients by local physicians practicing mental illness prevention and the results may be affected by their subjective evaluation. Finally, we did not evaluate the depression or anxiety symptoms of these patients before the outbreak, which leads to a lack of longitudinal comparison. In the future, we hope to carry out longitudinal research and a more detailed assessment of the emotion and cognition of patients with schizophrenia in the community to help improve their community and family support.</p>"

"<p id=""Par1"">Numerous studies highlight the genetic underpinnings of mental disorders comorbidity, particularly in anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia. However, their shared genetic loci are not well understood. Our study employs Mendelian randomization (MR) and colocalization analyses, alongside multi-omics data, to uncover potential genetic targets for these conditions, thereby informing therapeutic and drug development strategies.</p>"
"<p id=""Par2"">We utilized the Consortium for Linkage Disequilibrium Score Regression (LDSC) and Mendelian Randomization (MR) analysis to investigate genetic correlations among anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia. Utilizing GTEx V8 eQTL and deCODE Genetics pQTL data, we performed a three-step summary-data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) and protein–protein interaction analysis. This helped assess causal and comorbid loci for these disorders and determine if identified loci share coincidental variations with psychiatric diseases. Additionally, phenome-wide association studies, drug prediction, and molecular docking validated potential drug targets.</p>"
"<p id=""Par3"">We found genetic correlations between anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia, and under a meta-analysis of MR from multiple databases, the causal relationships among these disorders are supported. Based on this, three-step SMR and colocalization analyses identified ITIH3 and CCS as being related to the risk of developing depression, while CTSS and DNPH1 are related to the onset of schizophrenia. BTN3A1, PSMB4, and TIMP4 were identified as comorbidity loci for both disorders. Molecules that could not be determined through colocalization analysis were also presented. Drug prediction and molecular docking showed that some drugs and proteins have good binding affinity and available structural data.</p>"

"<p><strong>Keywords:</strong> Anxiety, Depression, Schizophrenia, Shared genetic architecture, Drug targets</p>"
"<p id=""Par19"">Mental health issues have profound implications for individuals, families, and society, representing a crucial global public health concern [<a href=""#CR1"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR1"">1</a>]. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has heightened these concerns, with emerging evidence indicating an increased risk of schizophrenia in severely affected individuals [<a href=""#CR2"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR2"">2</a>]. Post-pandemic, rates of depression and anxiety have surged globally by over 25% [<a href=""#CR3"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR3"">3</a>].</p>"
"<p id=""Par20"">In addition to the direct association with COVID-19, abundant evidence highlights the robust genetic influence on mental disorders, showcasing significant comorbidity and placing these conditions on an age-dependent continuum. The widely accepted p-factor theory proposes a singular dimensional trait that measures individual susceptibility to mental disorders, comorbidity, disease duration, and symptom severity [<a href=""#CR4"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR4"">4</a>]. Supported by evidence across symptomatology, pathology, and genetics, this theory forms a crucial foundation for our study.</p>"
"<p id=""Par21"">The complex comorbidity of diverse mental disorders not only complicates treatment but also substantially affects patients' quality of life and daily functioning [<a href=""#CR5"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR5"">5</a>]. Although ample evidence points to a robust genetic basis for the high comorbidity of mental disorders, the complex etiology often makes it challenging to attribute the occurrence of mental disorders to a single genomic location [<a href=""#CR6"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR6"">6</a>]. This gap in understanding presents a significant challenge in effectively guiding the treatment of mental disorders and drug development. However, Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have successfully linked hundreds of specific genetic loci to mental disorders, offering the potential to alter this situation [<a href=""#CR7"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR7"">7</a>].</p>"
"<p id=""Par22"">Mendelian Randomization (MR) offers an experimentally designed approach, utilizing the natural distribution of genetic variations revealed by GWAS to tackle causal inference challenges in observational studies on mental disorders [<a href=""#CR8"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR8"">8</a>]. Additionally, LD Score regression (LDSC), a statistical method utilizing GWAS data, enables the evaluation of genetic correlation among different loci, providing an estimate of the genetic relatedness among phenotypes [<a href=""#CR9"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR9"">9</a>]. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the genetic correlation and causal associations among anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia using data from multiple GWAS sources, employing MR and LDSC.</p>"
"<p id=""Par23"">While GWAS excels in identifying SNP variations associated with mental disorder risks, it falls short in pinpointing the exact causative genes, posing challenges to direct drug development [<a href=""#CR10"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR10"">10</a>, <a href=""#CR11"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR11"">11</a>]. The Summary-data-based Mendelian Randomization (SMR) method aims to investigate pleiotropic associations between gene expression levels and specific complex traits, using summarized data from GWAS and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies [<a href=""#CR12"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR12"">12</a>]. In this study, extending the exploration of genetic correlation among three mental disorders, we employ the SMR technique to reveal core genes and proteins that may play functional roles in anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia. This promises a more precise understanding of the diseases' pathogenesis and enables an analysis of shared risk loci.</p>"
"<p id=""Par24"">Subsequently, through a colocalization analysis of GWAS and QTL based on SMR findings, we confirm potential therapeutic targets and common driving factors between therapeutic targets and the risk of mental disorders. This analysis aids in determining the causal relationship between therapeutic targets and diseases while eliminating potential confounding factors [<a href=""#CR13"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR13"">13</a>]. Building upon this foundation, phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) analysis explores associations between potential therapeutic targets and other features, offering insights into their multifunctionality and potential impact mechanisms for further research and development of related therapeutic strategies [<a href=""#CR14"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR14"">14</a>]. Finally, by consolidating results from multiple drug target databases, molecular docking studies are conducted to discover and validate the credibility of therapeutic targets at the atomic level through computer simulation techniques [<a href=""#CR15"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR15"">15</a>]. The study design is presented in Fig. <a href=""#Fig1"" class=""usa-link"">1</a>.</p>"

"<p id=""Par25"">In conclusion, our research endeavors to unravel the pathogenesis of anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia individually, exploring their genetic correlation, causal relationships, and shared risk loci with potential functional roles. By integrating results from MR, LDSC, SMR, co-localization analysis, and PheWAS, we aim to provide valuable insights for the development of more effective and targeted treatment methods, thereby addressing a critical gap in current mental health research.</p>"
"<p id=""Par26"">We obtained GWAS data for anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia from three databases: Finngen R9, UK Biobank (UKBB), and the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC). These databases collectively provide comprehensive genetic insights into psychiatric disorders. The Finngen database, with a focus on the Finnish population, contains genetic data from hundreds of thousands of individuals and covers various clinical indicators related to psychiatric disorders [<a href=""#CR16"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR16"">16</a>]. UKBB, a large-scale biobank project in the United Kingdom, encompasses genetic, clinical, and lifestyle data from approximately 500,000 participants, offering a vast dataset of genetic markers associated with psychiatric conditions [<a href=""#CR17"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR17"">17</a>]. The PGC database is an international collaborative initiative that consolidates genetic data from diverse regions, facilitating large-scale cross-population studies on psychiatric disorders [<a href=""#CR18"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR18"">18</a>–<a href=""#CR21"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR21"">21</a>]. Detailed database links and references can be found in Additional file <a href=""#MOESM2"" class=""usa-link"">2</a>: Table S1.</p>"
"<p id=""Par27"">Expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL) are genetic variations or single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci that influence gene expression levels. These loci exhibit associations with specific genes' expression levels in an individual's genome [<a href=""#CR22"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR22"">22</a>]. Studying eQTL provides insights into genetic factors that regulate gene expression, shedding light on gene functionality and its links to phenotypes. The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project is a vital resource that collects tissue samples from diverse healthy individuals, encompassing organs like the heart, liver, kidney, lungs, brain, and more [<a href=""#CR23"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR23"">23</a>]. With contributions from thousands of donors, GTEx offers extensive eQTL data, revealing connections between genotypes and gene expression levels. In our analysis, we focused on GTEx V8 whole blood cis-eQTL summary statistics (p &lt; 1 × 10<sup>–5</sup>) for SMR analysis.</p>"
"<p id=""Par28"">Protein Quantitative Trait Loci (pQTL) are genetic variations or loci linked to changes in protein levels [<a href=""#CR24"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR24"">24</a>]. Like eQTL, pQTL represents genomic positions associated with specific protein expression levels. These loci can co-localize with disease variants, helping identify pathogenic proteins, disease pathways, and potential drug targets. The deCODE Genetics team conducted a large-scale Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) using plasma proteomics technology. This study involved 35559 individuals from Iceland, analyzing 4907 proteins and identifying 18084 pQTLs. These pQTLs establish connections between plasma protein levels and 373 diseases and other traits based on genetic variations [<a href=""#CR25"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR25"">25</a>]. For our dataset, we initially filtered using a threshold of 1 × 10<sup>–5</sup>. Subsequently, we conducted local plink clumping with default conditions (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.001, kb = 10000) using the 1000 Genomes European Phase V3 file as the reference. We then prepared the necessary files in the required format for SMR analysis according to SMR analysis guidelines.Included studies had been approved by corresponding ethical review committees.</p>"
"<p id=""Par29"">To explore potential causal relationships among the three psychiatric disorders, we conducted MR analysis using the R package ""TwoSampleMR."" Following the principles of the Instrument-Relevance Assumption, Instrument-Independence Assumption, and Exclusion Restriction Assumption, we employed strict criteria (P &lt; 5 × 10<sup>–8</sup>) to select SNPs related to the exposure factor. For SNPs sourced from the anxiety phenotype GWAS data in the PGC database, we adjusted the screening threshold to P &lt; 5 × 10<sup>–6</sup> to ensure an adequate number of SNPs for analysis.</p>"
"<p id=""Par30"">Cluster analysis utilized a window size of 10,000 kb and a threshold of R<sup>2</sup> &lt; 0.001. To minimize potential biases, we harmonized exposure and outcome variables, ensuring consistent matching of effect alleles within the same allele gene [<a href=""#CR26"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR26"">26</a>]. For each instrumental variable (IV), we systematically searched the PhenoScanner GWAS database, excluding any SNPs associated with confounding factors to mitigate potential bias [<a href=""#CR27"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR27"">27</a>].</p>"
"<p id=""Par31"">The primary method employed in the MR analysis is the Inverse Variance Weighted (IVW) method, which effectively addresses heterogeneity among genetic instruments, enhancing the accuracy of estimates [<a href=""#CR28"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR28"">28</a>]. In addition to the IVW method, we employed various other MR models, including Weighted Median, MR-Egger, Simple Model, and Weighted Mode, to validate causal relationships [<a href=""#CR29"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR29"">29</a>]. To assess heterogeneity in gene exposure-outcome associations, Cochran’s Q test was utilized, comparing the variability in the estimation of genetic variant effects [<a href=""#CR30"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR30"">30</a>]. To account for potential outliers and pleiotropy, we applied the MR-Presso method for outlier correction [<a href=""#CR31"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR31"">31</a>]. For the assessment of horizontal pleiotropy, the MR-Egger intercept test was employed, using regression to evaluate the impact of genetic variation on exposure effect-associated outcomes, with p &lt; 0.05 indicating the presence of horizontal pleiotropy [<a href=""#CR32"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR32"">32</a>].</p>"
"<p id=""Par32"">For each SNP, a leave-one-out analysis was conducted, and a forest plot was generated to assess their individual contributions. Finally, the MR analysis results from multiple sources of GWAS data were subjected to meta-analysis to provide robust evidence for causal inference.</p>"
"<p id=""Par33"">Genetic correlation refers to the correlation generated by genotypes among phenotypes in a population. In GWAS analyses, the estimated effect size for a SNP often includes the effects of other SNPs in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with that SNP, meaning that SNPs with higher LD tend to have higher chi-square test statistics. This fact remains true when we replace the chi-square test statistic with the product of Z-scores from GWAS of two correlated phenotypes<sup>9</sup>. Based on this principle, LDSC can be utilized to estimate the heritability of a trait and the genetic correlation across traits from GWAS summary statistics [<a href=""#CR33"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR33"">33</a>].</p>"
"<p id=""Par34"">In our study, the “ldscr” R package was employed for LD score regression. The 1000 Genomes Phase 3 data of European ancestry served as the reference panel for calculating LD scores, and only SNPs in HapMap 3 with a minor allele frequency (MAF) &gt; 0.05 were included as input [<a href=""#CR34"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR34"">34</a>]. In the results, <em>rg</em> represents the genetic correlation between two traits, ranging from -1 to 1; values closer to 1 or -1 indicate stronger correlation. r<sub>g_</sub>P denotes the statistical significance, with values below 0.05 considered statistically significant.</p>"
"<p id=""Par35"">Based on the 1000 Genomes European reference, and utilizing SMR analysis, we conducted a three-step analysis to determine causal inferences between genetic loci and three mental disorders: (1) SMR analysis of GWAS data for three mental disorders and eQTL data from GTEx V8; (2) SMR analysis of GWAS data for three mental disorders and pQTL data from deCODE Genetics; (3) SMR analysis of eQTL data from GTEx V8 and pQTL data from deCODE Genetics, with a focus on important signals identified in steps 1 and 2.</p>"
"<p id=""Par36"">As a default, SNPs in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) with an R<sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.9 were removed, along with those associated with top eQTLs if the minor allele frequency (MAF) was &gt; 0.01. Significant SMR probes were selected based on false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected thresholds for SMR P values &lt; 0.05, and HEIDI test P value thresholds &gt; 0.05 were applied to indicate the lack of heterogeneity [<a href=""#CR12"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR12"">12</a>].</p>"
"<p id=""Par37"">The SMR analysis was performed on GWAS data from all three database sources (Finngen, UKBB, PGC), as described above. The selected genes and protein loci must meet the filtering criteria in at least one database and maintain consistent directionality across all databases. In other words, the impact trend of these loci on the diseases should be consistent across all databases.</p>"
"<p id=""Par38"">The selected loci identified through SMR analysis were subjected to three analysis methods: (1) Protein–Protein Interaction (PPI) Analysis: Identifying key loci through the analysis of protein–protein interactions; (2) Cross-Analysis of Causal Loci for anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia: exploring comorbid loci by analyzing loci implicated in the causation of anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia; (3)Selection of Implicated Loci in all three mental disorders: Selecting signals that meet the criteria of FDR &lt; 0.05 and HEIDI_P &gt; 0.05 in all three steps of SMR analysis. These are indicative loci that exert an influence on all three disorders at both the genetic and protein levels.</p>"
"<p id=""Par39"">Having conducted PPI analysis on the loci identified through SMR analysis for each of the three disorders, the underlying principle of PPI involves physical or chemical interactions between different proteins, leading to structural changes that can impact their functionality [<a href=""#CR35"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR35"">35</a>]. The online STRING database (string-db.org) was employed for PPI analysis with a medium confidence score set at 0.4.</p>"
"<p id=""Par40"">To validate the hub genes, topological analysis methods, specifically the degree algorithm, were applied. The CytoHubba plugin, integrated into Cytoscape 3.8.0 (University of California, San Diego, CA, USA), was utilized for this purpose [<a href=""#CR36"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR36"">36</a>]. Through an analysis of the topological structure of the PPI network, key nodes were identified.</p>"
"<p id=""Par41"">A cross-analysis was performed on the pathogenic loci identified by SMR analysis for the three disorders, aiming to identify common loci and determine whether these loci exhibit consistent directional effects (either as risk factors or protective factors) across all diseases.</p>"
"<p id=""Par42"">Screening for anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia identified loci that met the selection criteria in the Three-step SMR analysis. These loci provide systematic evidence for correlations: the correlation between gene expression and disease, the correlation between corresponding protein expression and disease, and the impact of gene expression on corresponding protein expression levels. This analysis substantially enhances the reliability of the identified loci.</p>"
"<p id=""Par43"">Colocalization analysis was conducted for the loci identified in anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia using GWAS and QTL data. This analysis aimed to confirm potential therapeutic targets and identify common driving factors associated with the risk of the three mental disorders. Its purpose was to strengthen the evidence of the association between targets and disease phenotypes, facilitating the determination of causal relationships between therapeutic targets and diseases while minimizing potential confounding factors [<a href=""#CR37"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR37"">37</a>, <a href=""#CR38"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR38"">38</a>].</p>"
"<p id=""Par44"">The colocalization analysis was conducted using the “coloc” R package, with a threshold of PPH4 &gt; 0.8. This threshold was used to determine the presence of shared genetic effects between the targets and phenotypes, providing a reliable basis for further investigation and therapeutic development [<a href=""#CR39"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR39"">39</a>, <a href=""#CR40"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR40"">40</a>].</p>"
"<p id=""Par45"">We performed a PheWAS analysis on GWAS summary statistics resources using the GWAS ATLAS analysis tool [<a href=""#CR41"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR41"">41</a>–<a href=""#CR43"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR43"">43</a>]. This analysis enabled us to investigate the associations of individual genetic loci with a wide range of traits across various GWAS datasets. We systematically examined and summarized the loci identified in the three mental disorders, shedding light on the multifunctionality of these loci and the potential mechanisms underlying their effects on various traits [<a href=""#CR44"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR44"">44</a>].</p>"
"<p id=""Par46"">Before delving into further research and development of potential therapeutic drugs, we explored existing practical drugs' interactions with the identified targets by assessing protein-drug interactions [<a href=""#CR45"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR45"">45</a>]. Specifically, we utilized five drug target prediction databases: DrugBank [<a href=""#CR46"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR46"">46</a>], Therapeutic Target Database [<a href=""#CR47"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR47"">47</a>], ChEMBL [<a href=""#CR48"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR48"">48</a>], DGIdb [<a href=""#CR49"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR49"">49</a>], and PharmSnap. These databases link drugs and other chemical substances to their target genes, aiding in the identification and prediction of candidate drugs targeting the discovered loci in our study.</p>"
"<p id=""Par47"">This comprehensive approach enhances our understanding of the potential therapeutic interventions for the studied mental disorders and paves the way for the development of novel treatment strategies.</p>"
"<p id=""Par48"">To gain deeper insights into the impact of candidate drugs on the drug targets associated with the three mental disorders and assess the druggability of these targets at the atomic level, our study conducted molecular docking analysis. We employed Autodock Vina 1.2.2, a computational protein–ligand docking software, to evaluate the binding energy and interaction patterns between candidate drugs/small molecules and their respective targets [<a href=""#CR50"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR50"">50</a>].</p>"
"<p id=""Par49"">The drug structure data were obtained from the PubChem compound database, while the protein 3D structure data were sourced from the PDB database [<a href=""#CR51"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR51"">51</a>]. All protein and molecule files were converted into PDBQT format, with the exclusion of water molecules and the addition of polar hydrogen atoms. The grid box dimensions were configured to 30 Å × 30 Å × 30 Å, with a grid point distance of 0.05 nm. Molecular docking studies were carried out using Autodock Vina 1.2.2.</p>"
"<p id=""Par50"">We conducted bidirectional MR analysis using data from three databases to explore causal relationships among three mental disorders. Specifically, we used Finngen-derived GWAS data as the exposure variable with UKBB data as the outcome, PGC-derived GWAS data as the exposure variable with Finngen data as the outcome, and PGC-derived GWAS data as the exposure variable with UKBB data as the outcome. Utilizing five different MR methods and performing meta-analysis, we identified evidence supporting causal relationships between depression and anxiety (IVW OR = 1.79; 95% CI 1.59–2.02; P &lt; 0.05), schizophrenia and anxiety (IVW OR = 1.17; 95% CI 1.13–1.21; P &lt; 0.05), as well as schizophrenia and depression (IVW OR = 1.13; 95% CI 1.10–1.17; P &lt; 0.05) (Fig. <a href=""#Fig2"" class=""usa-link"">2</a>a–c and Additional file <a href=""#MOESM2"" class=""usa-link"">2</a>: Table S2). The analysis showed no significant heterogeneity or evidence of pleiotropy. Leave-one-out analysis indicated that the results were not driven by any single SNP (Additional file <a href=""#MOESM1"" class=""usa-link"">1</a>: Figs. S1–S18). Overall, this analysis provides strong evidence for the existence of causal relationships among these mental disorders, highlighting their intricate genetic connections.</p>"

"<p id=""Par51"">We employed LDSC analysis to assess the genetic correlations among anxiety disorder, depressive disorder, and schizophrenia. Analysis using GWAS data from the PGC revealed the following correlation estimates: between anxiety and depressive disorder (r<sub>g</sub> = 0.907, P = 4.44 × 10–21), between anxiety and schizophrenia (r<sub>g</sub> = − 0.0175, P = 0.472), and between depressive disorder and schizophrenia (r<sub>g</sub> = 0.00121, P = 0.863) (Fig. <a href=""#Fig2"" class=""usa-link"">2</a>d). Analysis using GWAS data from the FinnGen database yielded similar correlation estimates: between anxiety and depressive disorder (r<sub>g</sub> = 0.884, P = 2.64 × 10<sup>–39</sup>), between anxiety and schizophrenia (r<sub>g</sub> = 0.356, P = 3.34 × 10<sup>–5</sup>), and between depressive disorder and schizophrenia (r<sub>g</sub> = 0.201, P = 0.00494) (Fig. <a href=""#Fig2"" class=""usa-link"">2</a>e). These results indicate a strong and consistent genetic correlation between anxiety and depressive disorder (Additional file <a href=""#MOESM2"" class=""usa-link"">2</a>: Table S3). In the FinnGen database, there is also a moderate genetic correlation between anxiety and schizophrenia, as well as between depressive disorder and schizophrenia, although it is relatively weaker. Furthermore, in the PGC database, this genetic correlation is weak and less stable.</p>"
"<p id=""Par52"">To identify potential pathogenic genes for the three mental disorders and explore their genetic mechanisms in gene regulation and protein translation, we conducted a Three-step SMR Analysis. Significant results from each step were systematically documented as indicative causal genes or proteins (Additional file <a href=""#MOESM1"" class=""usa-link"">1</a>: Figs. S19–S30). Within the three databases, we identified a total of 5 cis-eQTLs that met the criteria and exhibited suggestive causal relationships with anxiety, 39 with depression, and 217 with schizophrenia. Notably, 2 cis-eQTLs consistently affected Anxiety, 27 affected Depression, and 97 influenced Schizophrenia across all three databases (Additional file <a href=""#MOESM2"" class=""usa-link"">2</a>: Table S4).</p>"
"<p id=""Par53"">Furthermore, for cis-pQTLs that met the filtering criteria, 2 displayed suggestive causal relationships with Anxiety, 12 with Depression, and 41 with Schizophrenia. Among these, 1 cis-pQTL for Anxiety, 11 for Depression, and 17 for Schizophrenia consistently influenced all three disorders in the same direction across the three databases (Additional file <a href=""#MOESM2"" class=""usa-link"">2</a>: Table S5).</p>"
"<p id=""Par54"">To enhance understanding of the genetic characteristics of these mental disorders, we created manhattan plots to visually illustrate the genotype distribution of key eQTLs and pQTLs associated with anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia at both the genetic and protein regulation levels (Fig. <a href=""#Fig3"" class=""usa-link"">3</a>).</p>"

"<p id=""Par55"">After identifying genes and protein sites that may be causally related to anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia, as described in the methods section, we proceeded with three analytical methods for further validation.</p>"
"<p id=""Par56"">Due to the limited number of anxiety-related sites, constructing a PPI network was challenging. Consequently, we performed PPI network analysis on pathogenic sites associated with depression and schizophrenia. Using Cytoscape software, we identified and visualized the relationships within these subnetworks. The biological significance of proteins within these subnetworks was assessed by examining depression and schizophrenia betweenness centrality. This metric identifies 'bottleneck' nodes crucial for communication within the network. Notably, ITIH3, ITIH4, and NT5C2 were selected for depression (Fig. <a href=""#Fig4"" class=""usa-link"">4</a>a), while PSMA4 and ITSN1 were identified for schizophrenia (Fig. <a href=""#Fig4"" class=""usa-link"">4</a>b).</p>"

"<p id=""Par57"">We did not identify any comorbidity sites between anxiety and depression or schizophrenia. However, we conducted a cross-analysis of potential sites associated with depression and schizophrenia, which revealed four intersecting sites: BTN3A1, CYP21A2, PSMB4, and TIMP4 (Fig. <a href=""#Fig4"" class=""usa-link"">4</a>c). The consistent impact of these four sites on both depression and schizophrenia suggests that they may be shared factors contributing to the comorbidity of these two disorders.</p>"
"<p id=""Par58"">We filtered sites that met the criteria in all three steps of the Three-step SMR analysis for anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia. These sites satisfy both the correlation between gene expression and the disease and the correlation between corresponding protein expression and the disease, concurrently demonstrating that the gene expression level can impact the corresponding protein expression level. A total of three such sites were identified: CCS for depression and CTSS and DNPH1 for schizophrenia (Fig. <a href=""#Fig4"" class=""usa-link"">4</a>d, e).</p>"
"<p id=""Par59"">To verify the co-localization of the sites identified in the screening of anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia, we conducted co-localization analysis. We performed co-localization analysis on PPI core sites, comorbidity sites, and sites filtered through the three-step SMR analysis. The co-localization results, with PPH4 &gt; 0.8, included ITIH3, BTN3A1, PSMB4, TIMP4, CCS, CTSS, and DNPH1 from the three-step SMR analysis. These results are presented in Table <a href=""#Tab1"" class=""usa-link"">1</a>.</p>"
<p>Colocalization results of QTLs for site with mental disorder</p>
"<p id=""Par60"">Through our analysis, we identified several key genes and proteins associated with the onset of anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia. Notably, sites such as ITIH3, CCS, CTSS, and DNPH1 were found to play pivotal roles in shaping the genetic landscape of mental health. ITIH3 is involved in regulating inflammation and neurotransmitter balance, while CCS is implicated in the regulation of oxidative stress and copper homeostasis. Additionally, tissue proteinase S (CTSS) is renowned for its involvement in protein degradation and maintenance of blood–brain barrier integrity, suggesting potential connections with schizophrenia. Furthermore, DNPH1, which is involved in axonal transport and brain structure, may be associated with the development of schizophrenia. These findings align closely with our current understanding of the neurobiology of psychiatric disorders and offer promising avenues for therapeutic intervention, which will be further discussed in the subsequent sections.</p>"
"<p id=""Par61"">Utilizing the GWAS ATLAS analysis tool, we aggregated the traits associated with potential causal genes for the three diseases. Given the limited number of anxiety-related sites identified, further selections were challenging. Therefore, we proceeded to conduct PheWAS analysis directly on the identified sites. For patients with depression and schizophrenia, we selected sites through three screening methods for PheWAS analysis (Additional file <a href=""#MOESM2"" class=""usa-link"">2</a>: Tables S6–S9).</p>"
"<p id=""Par62"">Given the multitude of traits associated with each site, we excluded duplicate traits and present only the top 20 primary traits based on the total sample size (Fig. <a href=""#Fig5"" class=""usa-link"">5</a>).

"<p id=""Par63"">Using five databases, including DrugBank, Therapeutic Target Database, ChEMBL, DGIdb, and pharmSnap, we predicted existing drugs for the analyzed and screened sites. We identified a total of 12 potentially effective existing drugs. Excluding zinc ions and copper ions, which were too small for docking, and clozapine, which had well-established efficacy and extensive research, we conducted molecular docking for the remaining drugs with the target proteins using Autodock Vina v.1.2.2. We calculated the binding energies for each interaction (Table <a href=""#Tab2"" class=""usa-link"">2</a> and Additional file <a href=""#MOESM2"" class=""usa-link"">2</a>: Table S10) and included docking images illustrating the strongest binding energy for each interaction.

"<p id=""Par64"">In this study, we leveraged GWAS data from three large-scale databases to analyze evidence of causal relationships and overlapping genetic structures among anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia. Our findings contribute novel insights into the comorbidity of mental disorders and may offer implications for disease prediction, diagnosis, and treatment.</p>"
"<p id=""Par65"">We observed a significant and consistent genetic correlation between anxiety and depression across multiple databases. Furthermore, LDSC analysis of GWAS data from the Finngen database revealed a weaker genetic correlation between schizophrenia and anxiety and depression, supporting the significant role of genetic factors in these psychiatric disorders.</p>"
"<p id=""Par66"">Mounting evidence suggests that psychiatric disorders share common neurobiological features and exhibit high comorbidity. The p-factor theory posits that a single-dimensional trait can measure an individual's susceptibility to mental disorders, comorbidity among psychiatric disorders, the duration of illnesses, and the severity of symptoms [<a href=""#CR4"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR4"">4</a>]. Various explanations for this high comorbidity include similar life experiences, social stressors [<a href=""#CR52"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR52"">52</a>], environmental factors like trauma [<a href=""#CR53"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR53"">53</a>], and potential medication risks where drugs used to treat one psychiatric disorder may increase the risk of others [<a href=""#CR54"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR54"">54</a>]. Moreover, a recent meta-analysis of studies identified a common brain network sensitive, specific, robust, and consistent with injury-induced effects, mapping the atrophy coordinates of psychiatric disorders to this network [<a href=""#CR55"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR55"">55</a>]. This may reveal shared abnormalities or dysfunctions in certain regions or functions of the brain's neural network, providing stronger evidence for the theory of psychiatric disorders' comorbidity.</p>"
"<p id=""Par67"">Focusing on the comorbidity of anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia, approximately 90% of individuals with depressive disorders exhibit symptoms of anxiety. Patients with comorbid disorders of depression and anxiety can range from 46 to 75% [<a href=""#CR56"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR56"">56</a>], and the comorbidity rate between schizophrenia and anxiety reaches up to 38% [<a href=""#CR57"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR57"">57</a>]. Additionally, the comorbidity rate between schizophrenia and depression is as high as 40% [<a href=""#CR58"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR58"">58</a>]. These data align with our research results. In contrast to traditional observational studies, our LDSC analysis method, which does not require specific familial data, provides broader genomic-level support for the p-factor comorbidity theory.</p>"
"<p id=""Par68"">However, genetic correlation alone cannot distinguish causal relationships from genetic confounding. Therefore, this study conducted a meta-analysis of MR results across three databases, revealing strong causal associations between depression and anxiety, schizophrenia and anxiety, and schizophrenia and depression. Notably, the causal relationship between depression and anxiety, especially Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and anxiety, has been extensively researched and widely accepted [<a href=""#CR59"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR59"">59</a>]. In contrast, causal studies on schizophrenia and anxiety, as well as schizophrenia and depression, are limited and yield unstable conclusions [<a href=""#CR60"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR60"">60</a>, <a href=""#CR61"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR61"">61</a>]. Our study results contribute evidence in these aspects. MR analysis outcomes heavily rely on data sources, and by conducting a meta-analysis of MR results from three large-scale databases, we mitigated data biases, obtaining more reliable results. This finding reinforces the notion that individuals with one psychiatric disorder are more prone to developing other psychiatric disorders, emphasizing the necessity of early control for a single psychiatric disorder given the increased difficulty in treating comorbid conditions and the challenging drug selection process.</p>"
"<p id=""Par69"">After confirming the comorbidity and causal relationships among the three psychiatric disorders, this study employed methods such as Three-step SMR Analysis, PPI network analysis, and coloc analysis to explore the causal effects of all circulating proteins and genes in human whole blood on anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia. The goal was to identify disease-specific pathogenic genes and overlapping comorbid genes, providing preliminary clues for drug development. Through coloc analysis, ITIH3 was conclusively associated with the onset of depression, CCS exhibited associations with depression at both the gene and protein levels, and CTSS and DNPH1 were implicated in the onset of schizophrenia at both the gene and protein levels. Shared comorbidity loci between depression and schizophrenia included BTN3A1, PSMB4, and TIMP4.</p>"
"<p id=""Par70"">ITIH3 is a protein involved in the formation of Inter-Alpha-Trypsin Inhibitors (ITIs). Its primary functions include participating in the regulation of inflammation, tissue repair, and inhibiting the activity of proteases. Proteases play a role in processes such as the release, breakdown, and reuptake of neurotransmitters in the nervous system. Abnormal protease activity may disrupt the balance of neurotransmitters, leading to the onset of psychiatric disorders [<a href=""#CR62"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR62"">62</a>]. Additionally, protease abnormalities can affect synaptic plasticity, causing abnormal adaptations in neuronal connections and communication, contributing to the development of psychiatric disorders. Therefore, ITIH3 is intricately involved in the potential occurrence of various psychiatric disorders [<a href=""#CR63"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR63"">63</a>]. Recent research in Japan found a close correlation between ITIH3 polymorphism and prenatal depression symptoms in a case–control study [<a href=""#CR64"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR64"">64</a>]. Genome-wide association studies have also identified ITIH3 loci in a broad depression phenotype, emphasizing its role in the genetic correlation of depression traits and even schizophrenia. The shared genetic risk factors among these disorders suggest common pathogenic pathways [<a href=""#CR65"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR65"">65</a>, <a href=""#CR66"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR66"">66</a>]. Furthermore, the rs2535629 variant of ITIH3 is associated with the efficacy response to antipsychotic drugs, potentially impacting the treatment of mental health disorders, including depression [<a href=""#CR67"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR67"">67</a>].</p>"
"<p id=""Par71"">CCS protein serves as a companion protein to SOD1, assisting in the correct folding and insertion of copper ions into the SOD1 enzyme. This capability enables CCS to ensure that SOD1 receives necessary copper ions to effectively neutralize reactive oxygen species (ROS), protecting cells from oxidative damage [<a href=""#CR68"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR68"">68</a>]. Additionally, CCS participates in maintaining cellular copper homeostasis, constituting its two major functions. Oxidative stress and copper homeostasis are closely linked to neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. The central nervous system is particularly susceptible to oxidative stress, leading to neuronal damage, and such damage may be associated with mental health. Recent research underscores the role of copper in depression, as it is the third most abundant trace metal in the human body after iron and zinc, with high levels of copper accumulation in the brain [<a href=""#CR69"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR69"">69</a>]. The relationship between serum copper and mental disorders is currently debated, with some studies showing a positive correlation between serum copper levels and depression, while others show no correlation or even a negative correlation. However, the widely accepted view is that the imbalance of copper homeostasis leading to oxidative stress and inflammatory responses is associated with depression. In addition to its involvement in copper metabolism, some studies suggest that CCS is also related to zinc ions. CCS may form complexes with zinc ions, playing a crucial regulatory role in psychiatric disorders, including influencing neurotransmitter synthesis and release [<a href=""#CR70"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR70"">70</a>]. Through drug target predictions, we found that copper and zinc ions can bind to CCS, demonstrating their potential as therapeutic drugs, which may represent a novel treatment direction for depression.</p>"
"<p id=""Par72"">CTSS, or Cathepsin S, is a lysosomal cysteine protease enzyme involved in the degradation of proteins within lysosomes. Research highlights Cathepsin S's involvement in memory function in the brain and its association with psychiatric disorders such as MDD, bipolar affective disorder, and schizophrenia [<a href=""#CR71"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR71"">71</a>]. Cathepsin S also plays a role in regulating the integrity of the blood–brain barrier (BBB), and changes in BBB permeability may affect the entry of immune cells and inflammatory factors into the brain, potentially contributing to the onset of psychiatric disorders [<a href=""#CR72"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR72"">72</a>]. Recent genetic studies have found potential associations between the CTSS gene and susceptibility to schizophrenia [<a href=""#CR73"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR73"">73</a>]. However, it's crucial to note that the relationship between CTSS and psychiatric disorders, especially schizophrenia, is complex and multifactorial. Further research is needed to elucidate the specific molecular and cellular processes of lysosomal protease S in psychiatric disorders.</p>"
"<p id=""Par73"">DNPH1 is related to the regulation of axonemal dynein, a motor protein involved in various cellular processes, including retrograde transport in axons and intracellular positioning of organelles. Specific research on the connection between DNPH1 and psychiatric disorders is limited. A recent study on schizophrenia and brain structure found that certain gene variations (SNVs) are associated with schizophrenia and brain features such as surface area and thickness. DNPH1 is highly expressed in the cerebral cortex and is one of the genes significantly associated with schizophrenia and brain structure features [<a href=""#CR74"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR74"">74</a>]. This suggests a potential role of DNPH1 in schizophrenia and its potential as a therapeutic target.</p>"
"<p id=""Par74"">As mentioned earlier, patients with schizophrenia are more likely to experience depression. The overlap in symptoms and genetic risk factors between the two disorders suggests a common etiological mechanism. Factors such as maternal immune activation, social isolation, neurotransmitters, the immune system, environment, and metabolism may contribute to their comorbidity. We have identified shared comorbidity loci between schizophrenia and depression, including BTN3A1, PSMB4, and TIMP4.</p>"
"<p id=""Par75"">BTN3A1, Butyrophilin Subfamily 3 Member A1, belongs to the butyrophilin protein family and encodes a transmembrane protein. Proteins in the butyrophilin family are known to participate in immune system regulation. BTN3A1 plays a crucial role in antigen presentation and is highly expressed in the cerebral cortex [<a href=""#CR75"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR75"">75</a>].This suggests a potential close association between BTN3A1 and psychiatric disorders. However, research on the relationship between BTN3A1 and mental illness is still limited and requires further exploration.</p>"
"<p id=""Par76"">PSMB4 is a proteasome subunit, and the proteasome is a large protein complex responsible for ubiquitin-mediated degradation and recycling of damaged or misfolded proteins to maintain cellular homeostasis. Dysfunction in ubiquitin–proteasome function can lead to the accumulation of misfolded and damaged proteins, contributing to the development of diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and schizophrenia [<a href=""#CR76"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR76"">76</a>, <a href=""#CR77"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR77"">77</a>]. Impaired proteasome function can also result in mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, both linked to various mental health conditions. Similarly, the research team led by M-L Wong identified a correlation between certain variations in the PSMB4 gene, revealed through polymorphism analysis of inflammatory genes, and susceptibility to MDD [<a href=""#CR78"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR78"">78</a>]. Therefore, targeting PSMB4 for treatment and thereby improving ubiquitin–proteasome function could be a promising approach to correct psychiatric disorders.</p>"
"<p id=""Par77"">TIMP4's main function is to inhibit metalloproteinases, especially matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). MMPs are involved in the degradation of various components of the extracellular matrix, such as collagen, gelatin, and proteoglycans [<a href=""#CR79"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR79"">79</a>]. By inhibiting MMPs, TIMP4 regulates tissue remodeling, maintains the extracellular matrix, and participates in synaptic plasticity, neuronal differentiation, and neuroprotection in the central nervous system. One study investigated the correlation between the TIMP gene and protein expression levels and depression.The results indicate that changes in the expression of MMPs and TIMP may be a common factor in recurrent depression and somatic diseases, possibly even serving as a marker [<a href=""#CR80"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR80"">80</a>].</p>"
"<p id=""Par78"">Contrary to expectations, a study in 2013 found no significant correlation between a SNP (rs3755724) encoding TIMP4 and schizophrenia [<a href=""#CR81"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR81"">81</a>]. However, the lack of association with a single SNP does not rule out the potential linkage between TIMP4 and psychiatric disorders. Psychiatric disorders result from complex interactions of multiple genes, environmental factors, and genetic heterogeneity. Other TIMP4 variations or interactions with different genes may still be relevant to psychiatric disorders. Additionally, the study was conducted on a Korean population, and genetic heterogeneity between different populations suggests that the role of TIMP4 in psychiatric disorders may vary across different ethnic groups. Further exploration is needed to understand the relationship between TIMP4 and mental illnesses.</p>"
"<p id=""Par79"">We also observed certain loci that haven't undergone co-localization testing, and we conducted drug predictions and molecular docking for these specific targets. Currently, the evidence for the causal relationship between these loci and the three mental disorders may be relatively limited, requiring further validation.</p>"
"<p id=""Par80"">The strength of this study lies in the fact that, following the determination of the correlation of the three mental disorders through LDSC and MR, we employed SMR and co-localization analysis to estimate the specific causal impact of circulatory proteins and genes on anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia using genetic variation. The SMR design minimizes biases caused by confounding and reverse causation, thus improving causal inference. We conducted analyses in three datasets to ensure the robustness of our findings. Co-localization analysis has been proven as a powerful tool to reveal the pleiotropic effects of certain loci on multiple traits, allowing us to analyze the pathogenic loci and comorbidity mechanisms of the three diseases. Additionally, we used phewas analysis to summarize the correlations and predict related drugs for these loci, providing possibilities for drug development. Another strength is that we primarily limited the analysis to populations of European descent, significantly reducing population stratification bias.</p>"
"<p id=""Par81"">However, some limitations in the analysis of this study should be noted. Firstly, the current literature predominantly addresses the general association between COVID-19 and mental disorders, as well as the overarching trend of genetic susceptibility, rather than delving into specific genetic loci. As a result, this study did not extensively investigate the correlation between COVID-19 patients carrying specific genetic variants and the onset of mental disorders, thereby missing an opportunity to elucidate the significant role of genomic features in mental illness. Despite the exclusion of bias caused by linkage disequilibrium and potential reduction of horizontal pleiotropy through HEIDI tests in co-localization analysis, biases and horizontal pleiotropy cannot be completely eliminated. Furthermore, although the overlap of populations is minimal, there is still some population overlap among the UKBB, Finngen, and PGC datasets, which may introduce bias in the analysis. This could lead to interference effects where experimental conditions may impact each other among certain individuals, disrupting randomization. Additionally, focusing on the analysis primarily on individuals of European descent minimizes population structure bias. However, this may limit the generalizability of our research results to other populations.Secondly, plasma proteomic data is derived from the Icelandic population. However, data on the three mental disorders and the genome are primarily based on European populations. Despite adjusting for the top genetic principal components as population structure indicators in GWAS, differences in the ancestry of data sources may introduce population structure bias. Moreover, it's worth noting that we focused only on the cis-regulatory regions of eQTL and pQTL in our analysis, while trans-regulatory regions could also have a widespread impact on regulatory networks. Finally, further functional experiments are needed to validate the identified loci and predict the efficacy of drugs.</p>"
"<p id=""Par82"">In this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the genetic relationships and overlapping gene structures among anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia by integrating GWAS data from three large-scale databases. We discovered significant and consistent associations at the genetic level among the three disorders. Through MR analysis, we confirmed relationships among anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia. Furthermore, we explored the associations of circulating proteins and genes with these disorders, identifying specific pathogenic genes that offer preliminary clues for drug development. Despite some limitations, such as the impact of population structure and the need for functional experiments, our findings reinforce the understanding of the genetic mechanisms underlying these psychiatric disorders, providing valuable insights for future personalized treatment and drug development.</p>"

"<p>Psychiatric disorders are a major cause of illness in the world. Unfortunately, many patients are resistant to treatment and present serious complications. Schizophrenia is refractory to treatment in about one-third of patients. Antidepressants are effective in about half of patients. Suicidal ideation is an increasing issue in patients with mixed features in bipolar disorder (BD). Therefore, there is a need to develop and test new drugs or new indications of available medications for the treatment of psychiatric disorders through evidence-based investigations. This narrative review aims to present the molecules approved by the main drug agencies, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA), from 2018 to date, along with new indications and new formulations of existing medications. We searched PubMed for new drugs approved for schizophrenia, BD, major depressive disorder (MDD), anxiety disorders, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). We evaluated their clinical benefits, safety, and tolerability profiles. Finally, we considered studies on the main molecules that have shown initial evidence of efficacy and are in the process of obtaining approval. Our search suggested that a new antipsychotic, lumateperone, and two drug combinations, olanzapine/samidorphan (OLZ/SAM) and xanomeline/trospium (KarXT), were approved for schizophrenia. In addition, some new methods of administration—monthly risperidone administration, subcutaneous risperidone administration, and transdermal asenapine administration—obtained approval from the main drug agencies. Lumateperone and OLZ/SAM were also approved in BD. Esketamine, a compound that modulates glutamatergic transmission, was approved to treat treatment-resistant depression and acute suicidal ideation. The dextromethorphan/bupropion combination was approved for MDD. Two new agents, brexanolone and zuranolone, were approved for treatment of postpartum depression. On the other hand, no new drugs received approval for anxiety disorders or OCD. In summary, some new psychotropic medications have been developed, in particular with the aim to improve the symptoms of resistant patients and to decrease the incidence of adverse effects. It is necessary to continue testing the effectiveness of new compounds in methodologically rigorous studies.</p>"

"<p>Mental disorders are ranked among the top ten causes of disease globally, and a significant proportion of patients demonstrate high levels of treatment resistance [<a href=""#B1-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B1-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">1</a>,<a href=""#B2-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B2-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">2</a>]. Of all mental disorders, major depressive disorder (MDD) and anxiety disorders are the most common causes of the global disease burden. Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (BD) are less common in the world population, but the disability associated with psychosis costs 10 times more than general patient care [<a href=""#B1-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B1-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">1</a>,<a href=""#B3-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B3-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">3</a>]. Although pharmacotherapy offers symptom improvements in many patients, antidepressants are effective in only about half of treated patients, and schizophrenia is refractory to treatment in about one-third of patients [<a href=""#B3-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B3-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">3</a>,<a href=""#B4-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B4-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">4</a>]. In 2019, across all age groups, depressive disorders were the thirteenth most frequent cause of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and anxiety disorders the twenty-fourth. DALYs are a unit of measurement that quantifies the impact of a disease on a person’s health. The percentage change in DALYs for depressive and anxiety disorders increased from 1990 to 2019 by 61.1% and 53.7%, respectively. Furthermore, in the 10–24 age group, depressive disorders are the fourth cause of DALYs, soon after “self-harm”. Despite the higher number of DALYs in the last years, the development of new pharmacological agents in psychiatry proceeds at a slower pace than in other areas of medicine with a similar impact in terms of disability (i.e., cancer) [<a href=""#B1-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B1-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">1</a>,<a href=""#B5-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B5-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">5</a>]. In order to overcome this disparity, we have to promote the development of new drugs and further clinical investigations to test the efficacy of these compounds in particular populations (i.e., treatment-resistant patients, young and/or old samples, psychiatric disturbances postpartum). A substantial proportion of the compounds recently investigated for the treatment of mental disorders originate from drug repurposing strategies involving established pharmacological agents now being evaluated for novel therapeutic indications, including the formalization of previously off-label applications [<a href=""#B2-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B2-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">2</a>,<a href=""#B5-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B5-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">5</a>].</p>"
"<p>The present narrative review is aimed to provide an updated overview of the main advances in pharmacological treatments of psychiatric disorders. We searched for and reviewed, both in terms of efficacy and safety, new psychiatric drugs approved by the major drug agencies from 2018 to 2025 for schizophrenia, BD, MDD, anxiety disorders, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). In addition, we included drugs that are already in use but whose recent approval concerns new modes of administration (long-acting, subcutaneous injection) and other molecules that have not yet been approved but show promising initial evidence in psychiatric therapy. It should be noted that no new pharmacological treatments have been approved recently for anxiety disorders and OCD; as a result, the corresponding sections are significantly less developed compared with those addressing psychotic and mood disorders.</p>"

"<p>Schizophrenia is a chronic psychiatric disorder that places a substantial physical, social, and economic burden on affected individuals [<a href=""#B38-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B38-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">38</a>]. The disease has a lifetime prevalence of about 1% globally [<a href=""#B39-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B39-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">39</a>]. Relapse prevention is an important goal of maintenance treatment in patients with schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders. Relapses can lead to hospitalization/re-hospitalization, slow and incomplete recovery, progressive cognitive and functional decline, treatment-resistant illness, and reduced ability to maintain employment or relationships [<a href=""#B40-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B40-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">40</a>]. Non-adherence to antipsychotic medication represents the most prevalent and strongly correlated predictor of relapse in individuals with schizophrenia [<a href=""#B41-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B41-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">41</a>]. Antipsychotics are a key part of the treatment of acute episodes of schizophrenia and maintenance pharmacotherapy. The first drugs that were used to treat psychosis were dopamine D2 receptor antagonists, and over time, the dopaminergic pathway has been shown to be strongly involved in this disorder [<a href=""#B42-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B42-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">42</a>]. The most recent drugs (second-generation and third-generation antipsychotics) are characterized by an extended receptor profile, including DA and 5-HT receptor (5-HT) subtypes and significant partial agonism at the D2/D3 and 5-HT1A receptors. The 5-HT1A receptor stimulation leads to the inhibition of 5-HT release and subsequent inhibition of DA release in the prefrontal cortex. A reduction in DA levels in the prefrontal cortex is implicated in the pathophysiology of negative symptoms in schizophrenia. It is hypothesized that partial agonists of the 5-HT1A receptor may increase DA levels in the prefrontal cortex with less negative impact on negative symptoms than atypical antipsychotics [<a href=""#B43-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B43-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">43</a>]. Moreover, 5-HT2C agonism may result in antipsychotic effects without inducing extrapyramidal symptoms [<a href=""#B44-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B44-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">44</a>]. Promising molecular targets include the D3, metabotropic glutamate, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 receptors. For several decades, the dopaminergic theory contributed to the discovery of typical and atypical antipsychotics and was the only hypothesis for the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. However, except for clozapine, neither typical nor atypical antipsychotics have demonstrated substantial efficacy in alleviating the negative symptoms and cognitive deficits of schizophrenia, which are key determinants of long-term prognosis and functional disability. Of note is the long-acting injectable (LAI) formulation in the treatment of schizophrenia. It is associated with reduced relapse and hospitalization rates compared with daily oral antipsychotics and improved treatment adherence and quality of life [<a href=""#B45-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B45-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">45</a>,<a href=""#B46-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B46-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">46</a>,<a href=""#B47-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B47-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">47</a>,<a href=""#B48-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B48-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">48</a>,<a href=""#B49-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B49-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">49</a>,<a href=""#B50-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B50-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">50</a>]. We have identified several significant developments in the treatment of schizophrenia: the availability of a new antipsychotic, lumateperone; the introduction of new methods of administration, long-acting subcutaneous and intramuscular risperidone and transdermal asenapine; and the introduction of new approaches, such as olanzapine/samidorphan and KarXT. In addition, two other promising molecules have been studied in recent trials but have not yet been approved: ulotaront and ruloperidone. Ulotaront is an agent that acts as a ”trace amine-associated receptor 1” (TAAR1) agonist with 5-HT1A agonist activity, showing promising but preliminary results in the treatment of schizophrenia, free of extrapyramidal symptoms or metabolic side effects [<a href=""#B51-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B51-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">51</a>]. Ruloperidone acts by blocking serotonin, δ-, and α-adrenergic receptors involved in the regulation of mood, cognition, sleep, and anxiety. Its specific therapeutic goal is to address negative symptoms in schizophrenic patients [<a href=""#B52-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B52-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">52</a>].</p>"
"<p>Lumateperone (ITI-007) is a once-daily oral atypical antipsychotic that was approved for adults by the FDA in December 2019, both for the treatment of depressive episodes associated with bipolar I or II disorder (as monotherapy and as adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate) and for schizophrenia [<a href=""#B53-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B53-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">53</a>,<a href=""#B54-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B54-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">54</a>] at a dosage of 42 mg/day. It is an antagonist with high binding affinity to serotonin 5-HT2A receptors, an antagonist with moderate binding affinity to postsynaptic D2 receptors, and a serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Lumateperone also functions as a partial agonist at D1 dopamine receptors, exhibiting moderate binding affinity. This activity may facilitate the indirect modulation of glutamatergic neurotransmission via AMPA and NMDA receptor pathways. Additionally, it demonstrates partial agonism at presynaptic D2 receptors, with a preferential action localized to the mesolimbic system. Notably, lumateperone exhibits minimal activity in the nigrostriatal pathway, thereby conferring a reduced liability for extrapyramidal side effects.</p>"
"<p>Two randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trials were conducted in 334 (aged 18–55) and 450 (aged 18–60) adult patients who met the criteria for schizophrenia or acute psychosis (DSM-5) [<a href=""#B6-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B6-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">6</a>,<a href=""#B7-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B7-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">7</a>]. The dosage of lumateperone ranged from 28 to 42 to 84 mg/day. The primary objective of the studies was to assess the changes in the total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) score from baseline to the end of the treatment period. Results showed that, after 4 weeks of treatment, lumateperone was associated with a statistically significant improvement in PANSS total score compared with placebo in both studies. In the study by Correll et al., the PANSS positive subscale also improved [<a href=""#B7-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B7-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">7</a>]. The greatest efficacy was reached with a dose of 42 mg/day (at twice the dose, the benefits were comparable) [<a href=""#B6-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B6-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">6</a>,<a href=""#B7-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B7-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">7</a>]. Lumateperone was also associated with significant improvements in other secondary endpoints, including the severity of global symptoms (Clinical Global Impression—Severity (CGI-S) scale) and the global functioning (Personal and Social Performance (PSP) scale) [<a href=""#B7-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B7-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">7</a>]. Lumateperone was generally well tolerated, with no clinically meaningful motor-related adverse effects or significant alterations in cardiometabolic or endocrine parameters observed in comparison with placebo [<a href=""#B6-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B6-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">6</a>,<a href=""#B7-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B7-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">7</a>,<a href=""#B53-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B53-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">53</a>,<a href=""#B54-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B54-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">54</a>]. An open-label study examined the short-term safety/tolerability of lumateperone in 301 outpatients with stable schizophrenia who switched from previous antipsychotics to lumateperone 42 mg once daily for 6 weeks. Following six weeks of treatment with lumateperone, patients were transitioned back to their prior antipsychotic regimen or an alternative antipsychotic. During the lumateperone treatment period, PANSS total scores remained stable [<a href=""#B8-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B8-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">8</a>]. The most common adverse reactions were drowsiness/sedation, dizziness, nausea, constipation, and dry mouth [<a href=""#B7-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B7-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">7</a>,<a href=""#B28-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B28-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">28</a>]. Safety and tolerability of this medication were also suggested by a post hoc study of 1073 patients with acute exacerbation of schizophrenia randomized to receive lumateperone 42 mg/day, risperidone 4 mg/day, or placebo. Adverse events were mild, and discontinuation rates for side effects with lumateperone 42 mg were similar to placebo and lower than with risperidone 4 mg. The only adverse events that occurred at a rate of ≥ 5%, and twice that of placebo for lumateperone, were somnolence/sedation and dry mouth. In addition, the mean change from the baseline in metabolic parameters, prolactin, weight, and extrapyramidal symptoms was similar or reduced in lumateperone 42 mg/day compared with placebo-treated patients and was lower than in risperidone 4 mg/day [<a href=""#B9-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B9-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">9</a>]. Based on the pharmacodynamic profile and clinical data of this medication, depressive symptoms, negative symptoms, and cognition could be the specific domains of action of lumateperone. The peculiar pharmacological mechanisms of action of this drug appear to confer antipsychotic efficacy with favorable safety and tolerability [<a href=""#B5-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B5-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">5</a>].</p>"
"<p>Risperidone is a well-known antipsychotic that acts as a D2 and 5-HT2A receptor antagonist. The recommended daily dose is between 2 and 6 mg. It is administered orally, intramuscularly, and subcutaneously, including long-acting formulations. The FDA approved risperidone for schizophrenia in 1993, and the first LAI formulations (every two or four weeks) were approved in 2003 and 2007, respectively.</p>"
"<p>An alternative method of administration of risperidone LAI was approved by the FDA in July 2018: subcutaneous.

"<p>The pivotal phase III of the clinical trial randomized 354 inpatients with schizophrenia to receive either 90 or 120 mg of subcutaneous risperidone or subcutaneous placebo on day 1 and day 29.

In a similar way, physical functioning, social integration, and subjective well-being (measured by the scale Subjective Well-being under Neuroleptic Treatment—Short Version, SWN-S) improved. Patient-reported outcomes indicated greater overall treatment satisfaction with the investigational agent relative to placebo and to prior therapeutic formulations [<a href=""#B56-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B56-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">56</a>]. A 52-week open-label phase III study enrolled 408 new, stable patients and 92 rollover participants from Nasser’s RCT [<a href=""#B55-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B55-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">55</a>].

PANSS scores continued to improve in the patient rollover from the RCT and remained stable in the new participants. Quality of life remained stable throughout, as did subjective well-being. Satisfaction with the subcutaneous injection increased from week 4 to the end of the study [<a href=""#B11-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B11-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">11</a>].

In the 52-week safety study, 73.4% of patients reported at least 1 adverse event; the most common were pain at the injection site and weight gain. No changes in vital parameters, laboratory values, or ECG were observed [<a href=""#B10-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B10-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">10</a>].</p>"
"<p>In 2023, the FDA approved TV46000, which is a long-acting subcutaneous antipsychotic formulation that combines risperidone and an innovative copolymer-based drug delivery technology in a suspension suitable for subcutaneous use [<a href=""#B13-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B13-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">13</a>,<a href=""#B57-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B57-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">57</a>]. This formulation is administered every four weeks (q1m) or every eight weeks (q2m). The approval was based on the results of two randomized phase III clinical trials (RISE study and SHINE study). In both studies, clinical stabilization was initially achieved by oral risperidone therapy. The RISE study was a double-blind trial in which 543 adult patients with schizophrenia were administered TV46000 q1m, TV46000 q2m, or placebo. The results showed that the clinical stabilization achieved with oral therapy was maintained and further improved after administration of TV46000 in both formulations. The findings of the SHINE study were substantially in line with those of the RISE study. This trial consisted of the administration of TV46000 q1m or q2m for 56 weeks in 336 patients suffering from schizophrenia. Frequent adverse events were injection site pain [q1m, 5%; q2m, 4%] and injection site nodules [q1m, 2%; q2m, 6%]. The rates of patients with serious adverse effects (such as worsening symptoms related to schizophrenia and hyperglycemia) were 5% for TV-46000 q1m and 7% for TV-46000 q2m. Eight patients discontinued treatment due to side effects, and no patient had a serious reaction. Therefore, the results of this long-term safety study add to the favorable safety profiles of TV-46000 q1m and q2m, consistent with other risperidone formulations [<a href=""#B13-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B13-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">13</a>].</p>"
"<p>With regard to the intramuscular administration, in 2022, the EMA approved a new LAI formulation of risperidone. Before 2022, the frequency of risperidone LAI was every 14 days; the new formulation allows the administration every 28 days. We found two studies that preceded its approval [<a href=""#B14-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B14-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">14</a>,<a href=""#B58-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B58-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">58</a>]. In the first multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 12-month study, 438 patients with schizophrenia received monthly intramuscular injections of risperidone (75 or 100 mg) or placebo for 12 weeks. Results showed a rapid and progressive reduction in symptoms in patients with acute exacerbation of schizophrenia, without the need for supplementation with oral risperidone or loading doses. Moreover, both 75 mg and 100 mg doses were safe and effective, with significant improvements in both PANSS and CGI-S [<a href=""#B58-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B58-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">58</a>]. The most frequently reported side effects were increased prolactin in the blood (7.8%), headache (7.3%), hyperprolactinemia (5%), and weight gain (4.8%). Both doses were well tolerated. The second randomized, double-blind study was conducted on 215 patients with schizophrenia who were either stable (i.e., patients enrolled de novo, with stable symptoms), unstable (i.e., patients who had received a placebo in the previous study [<a href=""#B58-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B58-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">58</a>]), or stabilized (i.e., patients who had already received risperidone intramuscularly monthly in Correll’s study), who received risperidone monthly at a dosage of 75 or 100 mg, again for 52 weeks. The PANSS total score and PANSS positive and negative subscale scores improved in the three groups; CGI-S and CGI-I also improved, especially in the unstable and stabilized patients. Adverse events were headache, hyperprolactinemia, asthenia, weight gain, insomnia, akathisia, and pain at the inoculation site [<a href=""#B14-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B14-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">14</a>].</p>"

"<p>Olanzapine/samidorphan (OLZ/SAM) is a new drug combination that was approved by the FDA in 2021 for the treatment of schizophrenia and BD type I. Olanzapine is a well-known atypical antipsychotic, widely used for the treatment of schizophrenia and BD type I (approved in 1996 by the FDA and in 1997 by the EMA). Samidorphan is a novel pharmacological agent that functions as a mu-opioid receptor antagonist, a receptor implicated in the modulation of mood and behavior. It is thought that samidorphan probably downregulates the endogenous opioid system indirectly enhanced by olanzapine, thus reducing hyperphagia and gratification from food intake. The combination product OLZ/SAM received FDA approval following clinical trials that demonstrated its efficacy both as monotherapy and as adjunctive therapy to lithium or valproate for the treatment of schizophrenia and BD I, respectively.

"<p><strong>Roluperidone</strong>, currently under study (phase III in the USA), acts by blocking serotonin, δ-, and α-adrenergic receptors involved in the regulation of mood, cognition, sleep, and anxiety. The therapeutic target of roluperidone is to address negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. Negative symptoms significantly impact the daily functioning of patients with schizophrenia and unfortunately are relatively unresponsive to antipsychotics with a dopaminergic mechanism.

In both studies, patients received roluperidone 32 mg/day, roluperidone 64 mg/day, or a placebo for 12 weeks. The authors stated that the Negative Symptom Factor Score (NSFS), PANSS total score, PANSS negative subscale score, and CGI-S score improved significantly in the group that received roluperidone at a dose of 64 mg compared with placebo. The most common adverse effects, of mild to moderate severity, were insomnia, worsening schizophrenia, headache, anxiety, and agitation. Two deaths were registered among patients who received roluperidone, but they were not treatment related [<a href=""#B52-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B52-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">52</a>].</p>"

"<p>BD affects between 1% and 5% of the world’s population and is characterized by recurrent episodes of mood alterations, oscillating between mania or hypomania and depression, accompanied by changes in energy and activity levels. Its causes are not yet fully understood, but it derives from the interaction of genetic, neurobiological, and environmental factors [<a href=""#B67-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B67-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">67</a>]. The dopaminergic, serotonergic, GABAergic, and glutamatergic systems are key targets in the pharmacological treatment of BD, both for symptom control during acute phases and for mood stabilization. Treatment includes the acute management of manic or hypomanic episodes, maintenance therapy to prevent relapses and new episodes, and treatment for bipolar depression. Approximately one-third of patients do not respond to at least two treatment options and are considered treatment resistant.

"<p>As monotherapy, the efficacy of lumateperone was assessed in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study lasting 6 weeks, which enrolled 377 adult patients (mean age: 45 years) with bipolar depression. Lumateperone demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in depressive symptoms, with a mean reduction of 16.8 points in MADRS scores compared with a 13.5-point reduction in the placebo group [<a href=""#B28-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B28-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">28</a>]. Additionally, the efficacy of lumateperone as an adjunctive therapy to lithium or valproate was evaluated in another multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of six weeks’ duration. This study enrolled 528 adult patients (mean age: 46 years) experiencing a major depressive episode while already receiving stable doses of lithium or valproate as their primary mood stabilizer. The results showed a dose-dependent trend toward improvement in depressive symptoms, with a mean reduction of 11.2 points in the total MADRS score for the lumateperone group compared with a reduction of 6.6 points in the placebo group. Lumateperone was also associated with statistically significant improvements in other secondary endpoints in both studies, including scores on the CGI-S scale and the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS). Adverse events were generally mild to moderate and consistent with those observed in previous studies on schizophrenia, with no new adverse effects reported. These data further support the favorable safety and tolerability profile of lumateperone across varying psychiatric populations [<a href=""#B29-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B29-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">29</a>]. However, when lumateperone was taken in combination with lithium or valproate, the incidence of adverse effects increased.

Only two cases of mild akathisia were reported [<a href=""#B29-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B29-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">29</a>].</p>"
"<p>The use of olanzapine was approved in 2000 for the treatment of acute or mixed manic episodes, in 2003 for the treatment of bipolar depression in combination with fluoxetine, and in 2004 for relapse prevention (FDA).

The study enrolled 428 patients diagnosed according to DSM-5 criteria with schizophrenia (268), schizophreniform disorder (66), or bipolar I disorder (92), aged between 16 and 39 years. Patients were randomized to receive OLZ/SAM (5–20/10 mg/day) or olanzapine (5–20 mg/day). A total of 33.1% of patients in the OLZ/SAM group experienced a ≥ 7% weight gain compared with 44.8% in the olanzapine group. The change in waist circumference was 2.99 cm vs. 3.90 cm, respectively. Furthermore, a negative change in the CGI-S score was observed in patients treated with OLZ/SAM, reflecting an improvement in their clinical condition. Additionally, OLZ/SAM and olanzapine demonstrated similar safety profiles. Weight gain was more pronounced in patients receiving olanzapine as early as week 6, and this trend persisted through the assessment at week 12.</p>"
"<p>Recently, numerous studies have investigated the potential use of ketamine and esketamine in alleviating suicidal ideation and depressive symptoms through NMDA receptor antagonism. Recent investigations also suggested that BD is associated with immune system dysfunction, characterized by increased proinflammatory cytokines in the nervous system of affected individuals [<a href=""#B69-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B69-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">69</a>]. The hypothesis that the immune system plays a key role in BD progression was initially proposed based on the potential immunomodulatory effects of lithium in mood stabilization. Indeed, both manic and depressive episodes in BD are associated with the activation of neuroinflammatory pathways, as indicated by increased acute-phase proteins and pro-inflammatory cytokines [<a href=""#B67-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B67-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">67</a>]. For example, manic states in BD are characterized by elevated levels of acute-phase proteins, including interleukin (IL), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) [<a href=""#B69-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B69-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">69</a>], as well as haptoglobin, fibrinogen, and C-reactive protein (CRP), with a particularly pronounced increase in CRP during manic phases [<a href=""#B67-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B67-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">67</a>,<a href=""#B70-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B70-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">70</a>]. Furthermore, BD patients exhibit a higher incidence of multisystem inflammatory diseases. The immune-inflammatory hypothesis opens new therapeutic perspectives for BD, including the opportunity to develop novel pharmacological approaches and to optimize targeted therapeutic strategies using monoclonal antibodies [<a href=""#B69-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B69-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">69</a>]. Based on these new approaches, numerous studies have been conducted to evaluate the potential efficacy of the new molecules in BD. These medications are not currently approved for the treatment of BD. However, we have chosen to include them in this review because research in recent years has focused on the use of these molecules in the setting of bipolar depression.</p>"
"<p>Ketamine and esketamine are used in the treatment of treatment-resistant bipolar depression (TR-BD). Compounds that modulate glutamatergic transmission are considered effective in alleviating symptoms of depressive episodes in BD as well as symptoms related to mixed conditions [<a href=""#B71-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B71-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">71</a>]. The principal pharmacological target of ketamine is the antagonism of ionotropic NMDA receptors (NMDARs). At subanesthetic doses, ketamine increases glutamate release in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) by selectively inhibiting NMDARs on GABAergic interneurons, thereby disinhibiting glutamatergic transmission from pyramidal neurons in the mPFC. Excess extracellular glutamate activates synaptic AMPA receptors, leading to increased release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). BDNF promotes synaptic protein synthesis, dendritic spine formation, and synaptic strengthening, reversing stress-induced deficits in synaptic plasticity.</p>"
"<p>Furthermore, ketamine interacts with other neurotransmitter systems, including dopaminergic, serotonergic, adrenergic, and cholinergic pathways [<a href=""#B72-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B72-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">72</a>], as well as neuroinflammatory mechanisms such as the kynurenine pathway [<a href=""#B73-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B73-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">73</a>].

"<p>Given the large body of literature on this topic, we selected the most recent studies with the greatest clinical relevance. We reviewed four open-label studies that enrolled between 13 and 53 patients with TR-BD, treated with intravenous ketamine at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg, administered from a minimum of 1 to a maximum of 8 times. The results indicated that although ketamine is not yet approved for the treatment of TR-BD, it represents a promising adjunctive treatment for BD, with a good overall response rate. Additionally, its anti-suicidal effect was particularly notable [<a href=""#B74-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B74-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">74</a>,<a href=""#B75-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B75-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">75</a>,<a href=""#B76-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B76-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">76</a>]. The response rate in the three studies ranged from 24.5% to 73%. Improvement in depressive symptoms was assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) [<a href=""#B75-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B75-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">75</a>], the MADRS, and the Scale for Suicidal Ideation (SSI) [<a href=""#B74-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B74-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">74</a>,<a href=""#B76-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B76-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">76</a>].

Participants received multiple infusions (nine in total). A significant reduction in depressive symptoms was observed after the first three doses, as assessed by HDRS, followed by a subsequent worsening of symptoms and a full relapse by the third week. This discrepancy could be attributed to the small sample size or a higher level of treatment resistance in the study group. Additionally, all patients received antidepressants alongside mood stabilizers, which may have influenced the results [<a href=""#B68-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B68-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">68</a>].</p>"

Among these patients, 113 exhibited mixed characteristics. AIA symptoms were measured using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7). The overall treatment response was assessed using the Quick Inventory for Depressive Symptomatology Self-Report-16 (QIDS-SR16), while changes in suicidal ideation were evaluated using the specific suicide item of the QIDS-SR16. Patients with AIA experienced a significantly greater reduction in overall depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, anxiety, irritability, and agitation [<a href=""#B71-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B71-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">71</a>].

[<a href=""#B78-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B78-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">78</a>] assessed the real-world effectiveness of repeated ketamine infusions for individuals with treatment-resistant bipolar depression. A total of 66 patients diagnosed with BD received intravenous ketamine at an initial dose of 0.5 mg/kg diluted in 0.9% saline solution and infused over 40 min. If the response was inadequate, the dosage was increased to 0.75 mg/kg for the third and fourth infusions. Patients received 4 infusions over 8–14 days, depending on their availability and scheduling. A post-treatment evaluation was conducted one week after the fourth infusion, assessing improvement using the QIDS-SR16. The study found significant reductions in suicidal thoughts (QIDS-SR16 suicide item), GAD-7, and functional impairment (Sheehan Disability Scale). After four intravenous infusions, the response rate was 35%, while the remission rate was 20%.</p>"
"<p>Overall, the literature highlights that ketamine is a valuable intervention for rapidly improving depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation in BD. Additionally, ketamine has demonstrated efficacy in the rapid treatment of AIA in adults with mood disorders resistant to conventional therapies, as well as in alleviating anhedonia, a symptom strongly associated with increased suicide risk. However, intravenous ketamine is currently approved only for the treatment of treatment-resistant depression (TRD), and it remains an off-label option for BD.</p>"
"<p>The use of esketamine nasal spray (ESK-NS) in the treatment of bipolar depression is supported by two main lines of evidence. First, neuroimaging studies have shown alterations in glutamate neurotransmission at different stages of BD, particularly affecting the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex, two brain regions crucially involved in mood regulation. Second, ketamine, a modulator of the glutamatergic system, has demonstrated good clinical efficacy and tolerability as an antidepressant in the treatment of bipolar depression [<a href=""#B79-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B79-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">79</a>].</p>"
"<p>ESK-NS has a more favorable safety profile than ketamine, supporting its potential use in outpatient settings.

"<p>D-cycloserine (DCS) is both an antibiotic used for tuberculosis and a compound with antidepressant properties [<a href=""#B82-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B82-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">82</a>]. It acts as an NMDA receptor agonist at lower doses and an NMDA antagonist at higher doses. When administered in doses greater than 500 mg/day, DCS has demonstrated antidepressant effects in patients with TRD when used in combination with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). It has also been found to enhance the antidepressant effects of ketamine in patients with BD and BD-TRD. Additionally, DCS has been shown to help sustain remission from suicidality following ketamine infusion, particularly in patients with bipolar depression. DCS is considered a favorable oral antidepressant option, as it does not carry the risk of neurotoxicity or abuse potentially associated with direct NMDA channel-blocking agents. Overall, DCS appears to be an effective and safe antidepressant treatment [<a href=""#B82-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B82-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">82</a>].

A total of 22 patients aged 18–65 years with BD depression and suicidal ideation or behavior who had received either ketamine or saline infusion were enrolled in the study. Those who demonstrated improvement were randomly assigned to treatment with lurasidone or NRX-101. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the MADRS, while suicidal thoughts and behaviors were measured using the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) at 28 and 42 days. The fixed-dose combination of DCS and lurasidone was found to be significantly more effective than lurasidone alone in maintaining improvements in depression and reducing suicidal ideation, as assessed by the C-SSRS and CGI-SS. A reduction in akathisia was also observed in patients treated with NRX-101, consistent with results obtained in preclinical studies.</p>"
<p>Celecoxib (CBX) is a selective COX-2 inhibitor that has been investigated as a potential adjunct to first-line mood-stabilizing treatments such as lithium and valproate. Several small studies suggest that the addition of anti-inflammatory agents may improve depressive symptoms in BD.</p>

[<a href=""#B83-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B83-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">83</a>] examined the inflammatory profile of patients who had participated in previous trials evaluating celecoxib as an adjunctive treatment for BD. This study specifically analyzed blood levels of the pro-inflammatory biomarker CRP. The sample consisted of 47 patients, who were randomized to receive either escitalopram (10 mg twice daily) + CBX (200 mg twice daily) or escitalopram (10 mg twice daily) + placebo. Results showed that baseline CRP levels were significantly higher in BD patients than in healthy controls, suggesting that CRP may serve as a useful biomarker for BD. Although no significant differences in CRP levels were observed between the CBX and placebo groups at baseline, by week 8, CRP levels were significantly reduced in the CBX group compared with placebo. This suggests a reduction in inflammation in CBX-treated patients and highlights CRP as a potential biomarker for monitoring treatment response in patients receiving SSRI + CBX therapy [<a href=""#B83-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B83-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">83</a>].</p>"

The 12-week study included 60 patients aged 18–65 years who were randomly assigned to receive three intravenous infusions of infliximab or placebo at baseline and at weeks 2 and 6. Depressive symptom severity was assessed using the MADRS, with no significant differences observed between the infliximab and placebo groups at week 12. However, secondary analyses using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire revealed a significant interaction between treatment, time, and history of childhood maltreatment. Specifically, infliximab-treated patients with a history of physical maltreatment exhibited greater reductions in MADRS total scores and higher response rates (≥ 50% reduction in the MADRS total score) compared with placebo [<a href=""#B71-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B71-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">71</a>]. While infliximab did not significantly reduce depressive symptoms in the overall cohort of adults with bipolar depression, these findings, bearing in mind that these are preliminary data derived from a post hoc analysis, suggest that individuals with a history of physical and/or sexual abuse may benefit from anti-inflammatory treatment. Further studies are warranted to explore the potential role of infliximab in BD patients with inflammation-related depressive symptoms.</p>"
"<p>MDD is a leading cause of disability worldwide, significantly impacting the quality of life and social and economic functioning of individuals. According to the most recent estimates, the annual incidence of MDD is approximately 5–7% of the global population, with a lifetime prevalence ranging between 15% and 20%. The condition predominantly affects women, with a gender ratio of about 2:1 compared with men, and it is often associated with psychiatric and medical comorbidities, including anxiety disorders, substance abuse, and cardiovascular disease. MDD arises from a complex interplay of genetic, biological, psychological, and environmental factors. Key biological hypotheses involve alterations in neurotransmitter systems (serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine), dysfunction of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, neuroinflammation, and reduced neuroplasticity. Recent studies have highlighted the role of the glutamatergic system and neurotrophic pathways, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), in the onset and maintenance of depressive symptoms [<a href=""#B85-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B85-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">85</a>].

"<p>A phase III, open-label, long-term extension study (SUSTAIN-3) was conducted to evaluate the long-term efficacy of esketamine nasal spray [<a href=""#B31-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B31-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">31</a>]. The sample included 1148 patients aged &gt; 18 years with TRD, of whom 458 completed the 4-week induction phase followed by an optimization/maintenance phase, while 690 discontinued before completing the maintenance phase. In the induction phase, participants received intranasal esketamine (28 mg, 56 mg, or 84 mg) twice weekly for four weeks in a flexible dosing regimen. During the optimization/maintenance phase, dosing intervals were adjusted based on depression severity. All patients were also treated with an oral antidepressant (except MAO inhibitors). The mean cumulative duration of maintenance treatment with esketamine was 31.5 months, with a maximum of 4.5 years. The improvement in depressive symptoms was assessed by changes in the MADRS scores. At the end of the induction phase, 35.6% of participants achieved remission (MADRS score ≤ 12), which increased to 46.1% in the optimization/maintenance phase. The most common adverse events included headache, dizziness, nausea, dissociation, drowsiness, and nasopharyngitis. Regarding suicidal ideation, 4.3% of participants without prior suicidal ideation reported new occurrences during the study, and 10 participants (0.9%) exhibited new suicidal behaviors, 9 of whom had a history of suicidal ideation. An improvement in C-SSRS severity categories from baseline was observed in 14.0% of participants.

"<p>AXS-05, a combination of dextromethorphan and bupropion, is formulated as an extended-release tablet containing 45 mg of dextromethorphan bromide and 105 mg of bupropion hydrochloride. It received FDA approval in 2022 for the treatment of MDD in adults. Dextromethorphan modulates glutamate signaling through non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonism, sigma-1 receptor agonism, and inhibiting serotonin reuptake. Bupropion, on the other hand, increases dextromethorphan bioavailability by inhibiting the CYP2D6 enzyme [<a href=""#B92-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B92-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">92</a>], and it improves monoaminergic function by acting as an inhibitor of norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake [<a href=""#B86-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B86-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">86</a>]. The combination dextromethorphan/bupropion has been shown to be effective in rapidly improving symptoms of depression in patients with MDD, including those with TRD or suicidal ideation. The single-tablet formulation ensures a consistent pharmacokinetic profile and improves adherence compared with multiple treatment regimens, since dextromethorphan achieves a significantly higher exposure compared with non-administration in combination. A phase 3 RCT (GEMINI) was conducted on a sample of 327 patients with MDD with moderate-to-severe major depressive episodes ongoing for at least 4 weeks. The patients enrolled were aged 18–65 years. Patients were randomized into two groups: 163 patients received dextromethorphan/bupropion (45–105 mg tablet) and 164 received placebo (once daily for days 1–3, twice daily thereafter). Improvement in symptoms was assessed by MADRS and CGI-S. Clinical response was obtained by 54.0% with dextromethorphan/bupropion compared with 34.0% with placebo at week 6. Significant improvement in depressive symptoms compared with placebo occurred starting one week after treatment initiation and was generally well tolerated. The most frequent side effects were dizziness, nausea, headache, drowsiness, and dry mouth. Neither psychomimetic effects of the drug nor sexual dysfunction were reported [<a href=""#B33-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B33-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">33</a>]. Two other studies were conducted [<a href=""#B92-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B92-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">92</a>]: COMET, a phase 3, multicenter, open-label US trial, and EVOLVE, an open-label trial to evaluate the long-term efficacy of the drug. Both studies enrolled, respectively, 876 and 186 patients who were already taking or started taking dextromethorphan/bupropion twice daily for a minimum duration of 12 months to a maximum of 15 months. The improvement in depressive symptoms was assessed by MADRS and CGI-I and that of functioning by SDS. Remission was achieved in 46% of participants in the EVOLVE study and 52.5% in the COMET study at week 6. Improvements in MADRS and SDS scores were maintained for one year. The most common adverse events overlapped with adverse effects found in previous studies. An aggregate analysis of the GEMINI and EVOLVE studies showed that AXS-05 notably enhanced depressive symptoms independent of prior antidepressant treatment, ethnicity, and gender [<a href=""#B92-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B92-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">92</a>]. Another randomized, double-blind, clinical trial conducted by Tabuteau et al. [<a href=""#B32-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B32-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">32</a>] evaluated the difference in efficacy between dextromethorphan/bupropion vs. bupropion in a total sample of 80 patients with MDD. MADRS assessed the clinical improvement. Remission rates were significantly higher in the dextromethorphan/bupropion group from week 2 onward, with response rates at week 6 of 60.5% in the dextromethorphan/bupropion group and 40.5% in the bupropion group.</p>"
"<p>In summary, dextromethorphan/bupropion seems to be a useful intervention for major depressed patients, acting rapidly on depressive symptoms and global functioning, with a long-lasting effect in the absence of severe side effects.</p>"
"<p>The FDA approved brexanolone in March 2019 for the treatment of postpartum depression (PPD) in adult women. PPD is a severe condition affecting between 13% and 19% of women who have just gone through motherhood [<a href=""#B93-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B93-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">93</a>]. According to the DSM-5, postpartum depression is not defined as a separate diagnostic category but falls under the diagnosis of MDD with perinatal onset specifier. It applies when depressive symptoms begin during pregnancy or within the first four weeks after delivery. This disorder is characterized by a persistent state of depressed mood in new mothers, accompanied by feelings of sadness, worthlessness, and despondency. Brexanolone is a cyclodextrin-based formulation of the neurosteroid allopregnanolone (AlloP), a potent and effective positive allosteric modulator of GABA-A receptors developed for intravenous administration [<a href=""#B34-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B34-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">34</a>,<a href=""#B35-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B35-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">35</a>]. Two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trials conducted by Meltzer-Brody [<a href=""#B35-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B35-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">35</a>] analyzed the effectiveness of brexanolone in patients with PPD. Study 1 compared the efficacy of administering brexanolone 90 μg/kg per hour (BRX90), brexanolone 60 μg/kg per hour (BRX60), or a placebo; study 2 compared BRX90 with a placebo. Treatment or placebo was administered as an intravenous infusion for 60 h. Efficacy was assessed by the change in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) score during the infusion, with a 30-day follow-up. The mean least squares reduction in the total HAM-D score in study 1 compared with the baseline was 19.5 points in the BRX60 group, 17.7 in the BRX90, and 14.0 in the placebo group. In study 2, at 60 h, the mean HAM-D score reduction from baseline was 14.6 points in the BRX90 group and 12.1 points in the placebo group.</p>"
"<p>The results in the treatment groups were maintained until the end of the 30-day follow-up period and were superior to those in the placebo group. In addition, more patients in the treatment groups achieved remission than in the control group. In study 1, one patient in the BRX60 group had two serious adverse events (suicidal ideation and intentional overdose attempt during follow-up). In study 2, one patient in the BRX90 group had two serious adverse events (altered consciousness and syncope), which were considered treatment related. In the remaining study participants, side effects were minimal and similar to previous studies, with headache, dizziness and drowsiness being the most common symptoms, all considered mild and self-limiting. Brexanolone represents an innovative option for the treatment of moderate-to-severe PPD, providing rapid and effective resolution of symptoms. Limitations to its use include the need for hospitalization, intravenous administration, high costs, and in rare cases, risk of sedation or loss of consciousness. However, the risk–benefit ratio seems favorable for the treatment of moderate-to-severe PPD, with potentially significant benefits for maternal health in the postpartum period [<a href=""#B94-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B94-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">94</a>].</p>"
"<p>Regarding the use of brexanolone during breastfeeding, a study conducted by Wald et al. [<a href=""#B95-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B95-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">95</a>] investigated this issue. Twelve healthy women who had given birth within the past six months received an intravenous infusion of brexanolone (up to a maximum of 90 mg/kg per hour) for 60 h. The peak allopregnanolone levels in breast milk (125 mcg/L) were recorded between 24 and 48 h after the start of the infusion. Most women exhibited drug levels in breast milk below the detection limit within three days after treatment completion. A pharmacokinetic model predicted that 95% of patients would have allopregnanolone levels in breast milk below 10 mcg/L at 36 h post-infusion. The amount of drug transmitted to the infant through breast milk was found to be very low (median 0.69%, maximum 1.3% of the maternal dose) [<a href=""#B95-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B95-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">95</a>].</p>"
"<p>However, according to the information available in the brexanolone prescribing label, no data are available on the effects of brexanolone on a breastfed infant. While the existing data on its use during lactation do not suggest a significant risk of adverse reactions in neonates, further studies are needed. Currently, the decision to use brexanolone during breastfeeding should be based on the mother’s clinical condition and the potential adverse events that may occur in the infant (FDA, 2019).</p>"
"<p>Zuranolone (SAGE-217) was approved by the FDA in August 2023. It is an investigational neuroactive steroid (NAS) and positive allosteric modulator of GABA-A receptors with a mechanism of action similar to brexanolone and a pharmacokinetic profile suitable for once-daily oral administration [<a href=""#B36-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B36-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">36</a>], overcoming limitations to the use of brexanolone such as the need for hospitalization and intravenous administration. Zuranolone represents a promising therapeutic option in the treatment of PPD. One of its advantages is the short duration of treatment, requiring only two weeks. In addition, its rapid action makes it a potentially more effective option than SSRIs and SNRIs.</p>"
"<p>Two phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials evaluated the primary outcome of treatment with zuranolone vs. placebo. The efficacy of this drug was evaluated in the first study at a dosage of 30 mg/day [<a href=""#B36-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B36-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">36</a>] and in the second trial at 50 mg/day [<a href=""#B37-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B37-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">37</a>]. Zuranolone was taken once daily for 14 days. In the first study, 153 patients were enrolled, and in the second, 196 subjects. In both studies, patients could continue taking antidepressants if they maintained a stable dosage for at least 30 days before the first treatment dose. All patients were evaluated in the post-treatment follow-up until day 45. The following rating scales were used to assess treatment efficacy: HAM-D, HAM-A, CGI-S, MADRS [<a href=""#B36-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B36-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">36</a>], and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) [<a href=""#B37-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B37-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">37</a>].

Patients treated with zuranolone showed a statistically significant effect in the score change in all the evaluation scales (as early as day 15 of treatment) compared with the placebo group. Zuranolone was also significantly associated with a higher response and remission rate compared with placebo. Zuranolone is an effective and safe drug for short-term monotherapy of MDD. It shows results in 14 days (compared with 2–4 weeks for SSRIs) and has anti-anxiolytic effects.

"<p>It is essential to consider the complex and multifactorial nature of postpartum depression. Although drug therapies represent only one aspect of treatment, factors such as cultural context, gender roles, and social expectations profoundly influence maternal mental health. Therefore, an approach that takes these elements into account is crucial to ensure effective interventions. Further research will be needed to evaluate how zuranolone compares with other therapies, its long-term potential, possible new indications for use, and the safest and most effective ways to administer it [<a href=""#B97-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B97-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">97</a>].</p>"
"<p>Some studies are available on the therapeutic potential of psychedelics, in particular on their effects on consciousness, emotion processing, mood, and neural plasticity. Regarding MDD, some recent studies have focused on psilocybin, a partial agonist of the 5-HT2A receptor. The psychedelic effects of psilocybin result primarily from the activation of 5-HT2A receptors located in the cortex and subcortical structures. These receptors are concentrated in the apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons in layer 5 of the neocortex, with a high density in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). This distribution is related to psilocybin’s effects on visual perception, attention, and other cognitive processes. Its stimulation is essential to produce the perceptual and cognitive changes typical of psychedelics. Other serotonergic receptors, such as 5-HT1A, are involved in the mechanisms of action of psylocibin. Studies in animal models show that psilocybin can induce neuroplasticity with antidepressant effects similarly to ketamine. Compounds that promote neuronal plasticity are defined as psychoplastogens and may have therapeutic applications in depression [<a href=""#B98-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B98-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">98</a>].</p>"

In a phase 2 double-blind trial, the efficacy of psilocybin was tested in TRD [<a href=""#B100-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B100-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">100</a>]. The study sample consisted of 233 patients, who were divided into 3 groups and received psilocybin doses of 25 mg, 10 mg, and 1 mg (control), respectively. Higher doses demonstrated significantly greater efficacy compared with the 1 mg dose on the primary efficacy endpoint as assessed by the MADRS scale. Antidepressant effects were rapid, appearing as early as day 2, and one-fifth of participants who received psilocybin 25 mg/day maintained a response from week 3 to week 12. Adverse events occurred in 77% of participants, the most common being headache, nausea, and dizziness. Serious adverse events were more likely to occur with dose escalation; the same correlation was found for suicidal ideation, suicidal behavior, and self-harm [<a href=""#B100-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B100-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">100</a>].

Psylocibin was administered as adjunctive treatment for TRD patients taking a concomitant SSRI. The aim was to test the compatibility of psilocybin with existing antidepressant therapies in patients who cannot discontinue SSRIs for clinical reasons. Results showed an improvement in depressive symptoms, with a clinically significant reduction in MADRS score at week 3 that was evident from day 2 and maintained over time. In addition, 42.1% of participants met both response and remission criteria. The CGI-S score decreased, indicating a moderate improvement.

"<p>Anxiety disorders are among the most prevalent psychiatric conditions and represent a significant cause of disability. The serotonin system has been extensively investigated in relation to the etiology of these disorders. First-line treatment options for anxiety disorders primarily involve serotonergic agents, including SSRIs, SNRIs, and azapirones such as buspirone. Nevertheless, side effects are common and affect treatment adherence in about 50% of patients [<a href=""#B102-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B102-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">102</a>]. In recent years, new agents acting on different 5-HT receptors have been studied in order to obtain clinical effects (similar to those of SSRIs) and more favorable tolerability profiles. The FDA has approved no new drugs for any anxiety disorders in recent years, and there is a relative lack of new drugs under investigation for these disorders [<a href=""#B103-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B103-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">103</a>].

In the last period, the molecules mainly investigated for anxiety disorders have been psychedelics (often associated with psychotherapies), drugs with glutamatergic action, and cannabinoids. The development of new therapeutic agents has been impeded by methodological limitations in clinical trials, including the absence of appropriate control groups or the use of placebos rather than direct comparisons with established treatments such as SSRIs or benzodiazepines.

<p>We summarize the data available on the agents that were tested for treatment of anxiety disorders.</p>
"<p>Lysergic Acid Diethylamide (LSD) is a well-known hallucinogen with psilocybin-like effects and is a Schedule I drug (into which are included drugs with no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse, such as heroin, marijuana, etc.). It acts on serotonin receptors, with anxiolytic potential. To our knowledge, in the period under review, two trials about the use of LSD in subjects with anxiety disorders were published.

"<p>3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is a psychoactive compound traditionally classified as a psychedelic amphetamine that was considered a Schedule I controlled substance in the 1980s. In more recent years, MDMA obtained initial promising evidence in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We found two recent studies on this drug: an RCT and its subsequent exploratory data analysis [<a href=""#B107-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B107-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">107</a>,<a href=""#B108-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B108-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">108</a>]. The duration of the RCT was 18 weeks. The trial was conducted on 90 patients with PTSD who were administered MDMA (80–180 mg) combined with 3 preparatory sessions and 9 sessions of integrative therapy. In the first study, MDMA was found efficacious at inducing a significant reduction in the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) score and of the total Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) score compared with placebo. In the second trial [<a href=""#B107-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B107-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">107</a>], MDMA-assisted therapy facilitated a statistically significantly greater improvement, compared with placebo, on the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20), the Self Compassion Scale (SCS), and on most factors of the Inventory of Altered Self-Capacities (IASC). These data indicate that, compared with inactive placebo therapy, MDMA-assisted therapy is highly effective in individuals with severe PTSD, and the treatment is safe and well tolerated, even in individuals with comorbidities (such as dissociation, depression, a history of alcohol and substance use disorders, and childhood trauma). MDMA did not induce adverse events of potential abuse, suicidality, or QT prolongation [<a href=""#B108-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B108-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">108</a>].

The first RCT included 169 participants with social anxiety disorders who received 50 mg of DCS plus CBT or placebo plus CBT during 12 sessions of exposure-based group CBT. Results showed that DCS did not potentiate the effects of CBT (no significant changes at the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS)) [<a href=""#B112-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B112-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">112</a>]. The efficacy of DCS (50 mg) combined with CBT versus placebo was also tested in a subsequent RCT on 24 adolescents with PD. Both groups showed a reduction in anxiety symptoms with no significant differences between them [<a href=""#B114-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B114-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">114</a>]. The second RCT on PD obtained similar results: 33 PD patients were randomized to a single dose of DCS (250 mg) or placebo 2 h before an exposure therapy session. DCS was associated with greater clinical recovery at the 1-month follow-up than placebo, but the placebo group equaled the clinical gains of the DCS group at the 6-month follow-up [<a href=""#B113-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B113-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">113</a>].

These studies consisted of one RCT and one subsequent exploratory data analysis. In the double-blind RCT, individuals were treated with 12 CBT sessions comprising 3 exposures. After a successful exposure, patients received DCS (50 mg) or placebo. Authors observed that during CBT, patients’ symptomatology decreased significantly in both groups [<a href=""#B116-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B116-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">116</a>]. In the subsequent analysis, they investigated anxiety levels during the sessions and observed a decrease in several outcomes measured in subjective units of distress (SUDS) in the DCS group (i.e., initial anxiety, maximal anxiety during exposure, and within-session habituation), while the placebo group mostly maintained similar levels of anxiety from session to session. Thus, the results suggested potential short-term effects of DCS on anxiety during exposure, but not lasting benefits. Therefore, modifications may be desirable to reduce anxiety during exposure or to speed up the learning process while maintaining treatment efficacy. However, due to the exploratory nature of the analyses, confirmatory studies testing the hypothesis of a decrease in SUDS in agoraphobic patients are needed [<a href=""#B115-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B115-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">115</a>].</p>"

"<p>We have already discussed ketamine in the previous paragraphs. Originally developed as an anesthetic, ketamine has more recently demonstrated rapid and robust antidepressant effects in numerous studies.

The dosage of ketamine was variable, also depending on the patient’s weight. The patient samples ranged from 13 to 158 patients. An RCT in which intravenous ketamine was administered at 0.5 mg/kg compared with saline placebo showed a benefit in 18 patients with social anxiety measured using the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) [<a href=""#B120-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B120-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">120</a>].

[<a href=""#B119-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B119-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">119</a>] showed an early benefit of ketamine 1 mg/kg injected subcutaneously once or twice a week for 3 months among patients who had responded to the initial study with increasing doses. This result was confirmed in the subsequent and more robust study by Glue et al. [<a href=""#B121-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B121-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">121</a>]: they administered to 13 patients with an anxiety disorder ketamine at escalating doses (0.25, 0.5, 1 mg/kg) or midazolam (0.01 mg/kg) weekly (versus placebo) and found that ketamine may be a potential therapeutic option for patients with treatment-resistant GAD or social anxiety disorder. Furthermore, ketamine was found to be safe and well tolerated. Two RCTs specifically treated patients with PTSD [<a href=""#B122-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B122-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">122</a>,<a href=""#B123-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B123-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">123</a>]. In the randomized midazolam-controlled trial by Feder et al., 30 individuals with chronic PTSD received 6 infusions of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or midazolam (0.045 mg/kg) for 2 consecutive weeks. The ketamine group showed a significantly greater improvement in the total Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for the DSM-5 (CAPS-5) and the MADRS scores than the midazolam group. Furthermore, 67% of participants in the ketamine group responded to treatment compared with 20% in the midazolam group. In contrast, the results of the study by Abdallah et al. were mixed. They administered 8 twice-weekly infusions of intravenous low-dose (0.2 mg/kg) or standard-dose (0.5 mg/kg) ketamine or placebo to 158 veterans and military personnel with PTSD. However, no significant differences were detected between the groups for PTSD symptoms as measured by PCL-5 or CAPS-5. As expected, however, the standard dose of ketamine improved depression, as measured by the MADRS, significantly more than placebo.

"<p>There exists a prevalent misconception that cannabis, cannabidiol (CBD), and other cannabinoids are benign substances capable of alleviating anxiety and promoting relaxation. However, the current literature does not substantiate the notion that cannabinoids are safe for individuals with anxiety disorders, nor does it support the idea that cannabinoids effectively reduce anxiety or related symptoms in this patient population. The quality of evidence derived from clinical trials investigating cannabinoids for anxiety remains notably low. Endogenous and exogenous cannabinoids act on the cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1), the serotonergic receptor type 1A (5-HT1A), and the transient receptor potential vanilloid receptor type 1 (TRPV1). CB1 receptor agonists have a biphasic effect: they have anxiolytic properties at low doses and anxiogenic properties at high doses. While CB1 receptor activation produces an inhibitory impact on the neuron, leading to an anxiolytic effect, high doses of CB1 receptor agonists induce activation of the TRPV1 receptor, which produces anxiogenic effects. Several drugs that act as 5-HT1A receptor agonists have proven effective in the treatment of anxiety disorders, and recent studies indicate that cannabidiol and other cannabinoids also act on the 5-HT1A receptor, resulting in potential anxiolytic effects. The most studied cannabinoid in anxiety is CBD. Preclinical studies in animal models and human trials indicate that CBD is a potentially effective treatment for PD, GAD, and SAD [<a href=""#B124-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B124-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">124</a>].</p>"

The durations of the trials were between 8 days and 26 weeks. The CBD dosage was between 300 and 800 mg/day. An RCT showed that 300 mg/day for 4 weeks of CBD could be a useful option in the treatment of social anxiety in adolescents. Berger et al.’s open-label study suggests that CBD can reduce anxiety severity and has an adequate safety profile in young people with treatment-resistant anxiety disorders (CBT and/or antidepressant medication) [<a href=""#B129-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B129-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">129</a>].

Furthermore, a single 300 mg dose of CBD was shown to attenuate the increased anxiety and cognitive impairment induced by the re-enactment of a traumatic event in patients with PTSD when the event involved a non-sexual trauma, whereas when the traumatic event was of a sexual nature, no differences were seen [<a href=""#B128-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B128-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">128</a>].

SSRIs are the first-line treatment, useful for about half of all patients. Combination treatment with SSRIs and low-dose antipsychotics is an evidence-based second-line strategy. Cognitive–behavioral psychotherapy (CBT) is also used as both first- and second-line treatment and may be helpful for many patients.

Such rare causes may be decisive in individual cases but will never be observed in a population study [<a href=""#B141-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B141-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">141</a>,<a href=""#B142-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B142-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">142</a>], as they explain too small a percentage of the population variance. This heterogeneity complicates the search for new treatments. This characteristic makes it difficult to find statistically significant answers in large-scale studies. Clinical OCD may represent a common final pathway that individuals may reach through different trajectories [<a href=""#B136-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B136-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">136</a>]. Alternatively, it may not be a unitary condition at all, but rather a multidimensional spectrum [<a href=""#B143-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B143-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">143</a>] or a collection of phenomenologically overlapping pathophysiological entities that do not share a common core. We must be cautious about what we can expect from group-level drug treatment studies; given the heterogeneity of OCD, it is unlikely that any single treatment will produce relevant benefits in all patients. The last FDA approval of a drug for OCD was two decades ago. No drug we will discuss has been approved for the treatment of OCD by the FDA, the EMA, or other drug agencies.</p>"
"<p>Pregabalin is a gamma-aminobutyric acid analog authorized for epilepsy, neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, and generalized anxiety disorder. The mechanism of action is not fully known: probably, it binds to voltage-dependent calcium channels with high affinity, reducing calcium currents and thus the release of several neurotransmitters, including glutamate [<a href=""#B144-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B144-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">144</a>]. Due to this presumed anti-glutamatergic effect, pregabalin has been tested anecdotally in patients with OCD. There is a 12-week, double-blind RCT on 56 patients with treatment-resistant OCD [<a href=""#B145-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B145-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">145</a>]. Pregabalin (mean dose of 185 mg) or placebo was added to sertraline therapy. A decline of over 35% in the Yale–Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) score was registered in patients receiving pregabalin augmentation compared with placebo. Tolerability was good. Therefore, these results indicate that pregabalin can be considered a promising augmentation therapy.</p>"
"<p>Memantine is the glutamate modulator (NMDA receptor antagonist) most studied for the treatment of refractory OCD. Memantine is a low-affinity, open-channel NMDA receptor antagonist characterized by a rapid clearance rate. These pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties may account for its distinct clinical effects compared with those of high-affinity NMDA receptor antagonists such as ketamine, which will be discussed subsequently. Although mainly used to treat Alzheimer’s dementia, some placebo-controlled studies have suggested a benefit in treatment of OCD. We found two RCTs in which memantine was administered, either with ongoing SSRI-based therapy [<a href=""#B146-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B146-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">146</a>] or in addition to sertraline [<a href=""#B147-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B147-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">147</a>], to OCD patients, in samples of 32 and 70 individuals, for 12 weeks. Improvement was obtained in Y-BOCS total score, Y-BOCS obsession subscale score, Y-BOCS compulsion subscale score [<a href=""#B146-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B146-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">146</a>,<a href=""#B147-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B147-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">147</a>], and WCST number of categories subscale score [<a href=""#B147-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B147-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">147</a>]. The main side effects were headache, diarrhea, decreased appetite, insomnia, and vomiting [<a href=""#B146-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B146-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">146</a>,<a href=""#B147-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B147-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">147</a>]. Modarresi’s study (2018) and others were summarized in a systematic review suggesting a substantial benefit from memantine treatment in adults with OCD [<a href=""#B148-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B148-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">148</a>]. However, these placebo-controlled studies on memantine [<a href=""#B146-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B146-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">146</a>,<a href=""#B149-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B149-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">149</a>] are individually small and were performed in the same geographical area, Iran. They produced greater effects than those observed in open-label studies performed elsewhere, with response rates in individual studies as high as 100%, raising doubts about their generalizability. In light of these limitations, memantine cannot currently be considered as an established treatment for OCD. Further large-scale studies employing rigorous methodology and encompassing diverse geographical populations are warranted to more definitively evaluate its efficacy and safety [<a href=""#B150-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B150-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">150</a>].</p>"
"<p>Existing research on the use of dopamine antagonists as adjunctive treatments for OCD is considerably more robust than the limited evidence available on strategies designed to potentiate dopaminergic transmission. Several studies have evaluated the efficacy of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) in disorders such as schizophrenia, DB, Parkinson’s disease, DDM, ADHD, addictions, and in OCD [<a href=""#B151-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B151-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">151</a>]. Along with evidence of benefit from psychostimulant treatments, there is one study on the pro-dopaminergic tolcapone, which further suggests that dopamine agonist approaches may offer relief from OCD symptoms. Tolcapone is a COMT inhibitor used in the treatment of Parkinson’s disease, and it enhances dopamine signaling in prefrontal cortical networks. It inhibits levodopa methylation by preventing the formation of its metabolite methyldopa [<a href=""#B152-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B152-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">152</a>]. Tolcapone was studied in OCD in a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study including 20 patients. The authors found that tolcapone 200 mg/day was significantly superior to placebo in reducing obsessive-compulsive symptoms (Yale–Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) score improvement) and was well tolerated. The main side effects were a reduction in bowel movements, fatigue, muscle aching, joint stiffness, and sleep problems. It should be noted that 25 percent of the participants were simultaneously receiving stable medication (SSRI or venlafaxine), and 80 percent had received treatment for OCD (SSRI or psychotherapy) in the past [<a href=""#B153-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B153-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">153</a>].</p>"
"<p>The serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist ondansetron is used primarily as an antiemetic. Nevertheless, it has been also examined as augmentation treatment in OCD. Since serotonin 5-HT3 receptors are indirect inhibitors of dopamine release at the corticomesolimbic level, potentiation with the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist ondansetron in combination with SSRIs and antipsychotics has potential efficacy in patients with treatment-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder [<a href=""#B154-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B154-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">154</a>]. Interestingly, ondansetron appears to reduce activation in cortical networks associated with interoceptive and sensorimotor processing, indicating a potential role in the management of OCD symptoms characterized by disgust reactivity and/or sensory over-responsivity [<a href=""#B155-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B155-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">155</a>]. To our knowledge, there are two RCTs on the use of this drug in OCD. The first [<a href=""#B156-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B156-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">156</a>] included 135 patients with treatment-resistant OCD and stable SSRI and antipsychotic therapy. Participants received ondansetron (4 mg), granisetron (2 mg), or placebo daily for 14 weeks. Granisetron is another serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist. Y-BOCS score decreased in ondansetron, granisetron, and placebo groups by 41.5%, 39.7%, and 15.2%, respectively. Furthermore, the complete response in the ondansetron group was significantly higher than in the granisetron group. Relapse occurred in 3 (7.31%) patients who received granisetron, while it did not occur in patients who received ondansetron. The results of this study suggested the beneficial effects of ondansetron and, to a lesser extent, of granisetron as augmentation therapy in treatment-resistant OCD [<a href=""#B156-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B156-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">156</a>]. The findings of the second RCT are substantially in line with those of the previous study. The trial was conducted in a smaller sample (40 patients), in which ondansetron or placebo were administered, in addition to standard therapy, for 12 weeks. The authors found a significantly higher response rate at 8 and 12 weeks in patients treated with ondansetron compared with placebo. Ondansetron was generally well tolerated. Among adverse effects, it may contribute to QTc interval prolongation. So, it should be used with caution in patients at risk of arrhythmia or when combined with other drugs that may prolong the QTc interval [<a href=""#B157-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B157-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">157</a>]. The main side effect experienced with ondansetron therapy is diarrhea, while for granisetron it is constipation and headache [<a href=""#B156-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B156-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">156</a>,<a href=""#B157-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B157-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">157</a>].</p>"
"<p><em>N</em>-acetylcysteine (NAC), an orally bioavailable prodrug of <em>L</em>-cysteine, promotes the synthesis of glutathione, an endogenous antioxidant capable of binding to and modulating glutamatergic neurotransmission via the AMPA and NMDA receptor systems.

Li’s study was conducted on 11 boys aged 8–17 years and lasted 12 weeks. NAC was administered incrementally over the weeks up to 2700 mg/day in monotherapy. It showed an improvement in the Children Yale–Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS). The only side effect reported was a skin rash. On the contrary, Sarris’s study (2022) examined 89 OCD patients who received NAC as single therapy (500 mg/day) versus placebo for 20 weeks, but it did not find significant differences in Y-BOCS score between the two groups. Therefore, available evidence is still too scarce and uneven to draw conclusions.</p>"
"<p>Methylphenidate, a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant, was largely studied for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy.</p>"
"<p>The idea that these stimulants might be useful in OCD seems counterintuitive. In fact, compared with ADHD, a condition well known to respond to stimulants, OCD shows the opposite pattern of frontostriatal activity (hyperactivation versus hypoactivation) and is at the opposite end of the compulsivity–impulsivity behavioral spectrum [<a href=""#B164-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B164-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">164</a>]. However, the neuropsychological literature has shown that the two conditions exhibit similar deficits in executive function, including response inhibition, attention allocation, and cognitive set shifting [<a href=""#B164-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B164-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">164</a>], possibly indicating a shared pathophysiology. Such deficits in OCD may underlie the beneficial effects of stimulant drugs. For instance, caffeine seems to attenuate experimentally induced distress and compulsive cleaning behavior in individuals with strong contamination fears. One hypothesis could be that caffeine-induced arousal has a beneficial effect on inhibitory control, and thus, on reducing compulsions [<a href=""#B165-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B165-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">165</a>].</p>"
"<p>Until now, only a single RCT evaluated the efficacy of methylphenidate in OCD patients. It consisted of a comparison between methylphenidate extended-release (MPH-ER) (until 36 mg/day) and placebo in 44 adults with OCD who were not sufficiently responsive to at least 8 weeks of fluvoxamine at the appropriate dosage [<a href=""#B166-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B166-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">166</a>]. A significant decrease in Y-BOCS scores was found in the MPH-ER + fluvoxamine group compared with the MPH-ER + placebo group. In particular, the Y-BOCS total score and Y-BOCS obsession subscale score were improved, together with anxious symptoms. No significant adverse effects were registered.</p>"
"<p>In conclusion, initial findings suggested that stimulants could represent a fast-acting pharmacotherapy augmentation option for treatment-resistant OCD patients. Long-term studies of larger samples are needed to assess both efficacy and abuse potential over time.</p>"
"<p>Over the years, several trials were performed to evaluate the suitability of use of psychedelics such as psilocybin, ketamine, and cannabidiol for the treatment of OCD [<a href=""#B167-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B167-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">167</a>,<a href=""#B168-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B168-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">168</a>,<a href=""#B169-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B169-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">169</a>,<a href=""#B170-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B170-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">170</a>,<a href=""#B171-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B171-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">171</a>,<a href=""#B172-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B172-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">172</a>]. Unfortunately, studies on psychedelic substances in OCD suffer from several methodological limitations. For example, some studies included healthy volunteers with sub-threshold OC symptoms or patients with other medical conditions; the rating scales are mainly self-administered; some studies are retroactive (with a risk of recall bias); protocols of study are not standardized; the dosages of drugs have not been specified. Furthermore, it is difficult to perform blind studies on psychedelic substances due to their psychoactive and hallucinogenic properties, even at very low doses [<a href=""#B173-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B173-pharmaceuticals-18-00665"">173</a>]. We lack specific data on the effects of psychedelics on brain neurochemistry and connectivity in patients with OCD. Current animal models of OCD also have poor predictive validity, making it difficult to conclude the molecular mechanisms of psychedelics for compulsive behaviors. Legal restrictions on psychedelics in many countries make it difficult to assess the true extent of their use and benefits for psychiatric disorders.</p>"
"<p>All these considerations have made us desist from a systematic analysis of the available studies. In fact, the results cannot be considered sufficiently reliable.</p>"
"<p>In this review, we have identified some new drugs approved by the major drug agencies (FDA, EMA) for schizophrenia, BD, MDD, and anxiety disorders. Lumateperone and the combination OLZ/SAM are both atypical antipsychotics approved and tested for the treatment of schizophrenia and, mainly in association with mood stabilizers, for BD. OLZ/SAM reduces the adverse effects of olanzapine, such as weight gain, with the use of samidorphan. However, it does not induce a significant change in metabolic parameters, including insulin, glucose, glycated hemoglobin, and triglycerides. KarXT, recently approved for schizophrenia, is a drug combination in which the anticholinergic side effects of xanomeline are mitigated by trospium. Ketamine and esketamine represent promising therapeutic options for the treatment of treatment-resistant MDD and BD due to their rapid antidepressant and anti-suicidal effects. Ketamine has not yet been approved for any psychiatric disorders. In mood disorders, it has shown significant benefits in patients with mixed features and high suicide risk, although its use remains off-label. Ketamine has also been studied in anxiety disorders and PTSD, with promising but still inconclusive results. Esketamine, administered by nasal spray, has been approved for the treatment of TRD and acute suicidal ideation. However, some limitations persist, including the short duration of the antidepressant effects, the need for optimized dosing strategies, and uncertainties about long-term safety. Further research is crucial to establish effective and sustainable treatment protocols for patients with TRD and bipolar depression. The combination of dextromethorphan and bupropion has been approved for the treatment of MDD. It represents an encouraging option due to its novel mechanism of action, which includes modulation of NMDA receptors and inhibition of dopamine and noradrenaline reuptake. Studies showed good efficacy and tolerability, although further long-term follow-up investigations are needed.</p>"
"<p>Brexanolone, the first approved treatment for PPD, provides rapid and substantial effects. However, its intravenous administration and high cost limit its accessibility. Future advances, such as oral formulations or alternative treatments with similar mechanisms of action, could broaden its clinical application. Zuranolone has recently been approved for PPD, offering a more convenient administration regimen than brexanolone (oral vs. intravenous administration). Both drugs represent an important advance but require further research to optimize their clinical applications and accessibility. In addition, the combination of DCS and lurasidone (NRX-101) showed superiority over lurasidone only in maintaining improvements in depressive symptoms and reducing suicidal ideation. DCS has been extensively studied in anxiety disorders and particularly in PD, suggesting positive initial effects, which need to be replicated in further studies.</p>"
"<p>Anti-inflammatory agents, such as celecoxib and infliximab, are emerging as additional options for the treatment of bipolar depression (in particular, in preventing relapses), although the evidence is still evolving. The results emphasize the importance of a personalized approach in the exploration and application of anti-inflammatory therapies to identify the patients most likely to obtain benefits.</p>"
"<p>Ulotaront, a TAAR1 agonist with 5-HT1A agonist activity, is a useful compound in patients with psychosis also due to its lack of extrapyramidal symptoms or metabolic side effects. It has been designated a Breakthrough Therapy by the FDA. Another antipsychotic under consideration is ruloperidone, which acts by blocking serotonin, δ-, and α-adrenergic receptors and is targeted at negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia.</p>"
"<p>The use of hallucinogens has been making a comeback in recent years: LSD, MDMA, and psilocybin have been tested in anxiety disorders. LSD and MDMA were found efficacious in reducing the severity of anxious symptoms, mainly in combination with psychotherapy, and were designated as Breakthrough Therapies by the FDA, respectively, LSD for GAD and MDMA for PTSD. Psilocybin showed prolonged antidepressant effects in TRD, albeit in preliminary studies. Despite its therapeutic potential, important questions remain about its regulation, safety, and clinical applicability. Future studies should clarify its role in relation to standard treatments and establish guidelines for its safe and effective use. Studies on cannabidiol have produced mixed results. It seems to be useful in treating anxiety disorders in young people. Nevertheless, the potential for abuse must not be overlooked, and therefore, selected cases must be chosen and use must be monitored very carefully.</p>"
"<p>Pregabalin, memantine, tolcapone, ondansetron, NAC, and methylphenidate seem to produce some benefits, with varying degrees of evidence, in treating OCD. Overall, studies are too limited to draw any final conclusion.</p>"
"<p>In conclusion, the available literature on the new advances in pharmacotherapy for psychiatric disorders suggests that the direction of research is to identify new molecules or new formulations of existing drugs in order to personalize treatments as much as possible while minimizing adverse effects. New research projects and increasing funding to collect more complete data on psychiatric treatments will be needed to reduce the burden of these diseases and improve patients’ quality of life.</p>"
"<p>As medical research increasingly moves in the direction of precision medicine and tailored treatments, psychiatric research should take advantage of studies considering both pharmacogenetic and pharmacogenomic approaches in order to detect genetic variations associated with treatment outcomes in psychiatry, including the response, resistance, and adverse effects rate of medications. Moreover, the approach of digital phenotyping (a new strategy that uses measures extracted from spontaneous interactions with smartphones to track mental status) should be implemented in order to monitor long-term effects of medications in geographical areas where access to mental health services is more difficult.</p>"

"<p> While the brain correlates of major depressive disorder (MDD) have been extensively studied, there is no consensus conclusion so far. Various meta-analyses tried to determine the most consistent findings, but the results are often discordant for grey matter volume (GMV) atrophy and hypertrophy. Applying rigorous and stringent inclusion criteria and controlling for confounding factors, such as the presence of anxiety comorbidity, we carried out two novel meta-analyses on the existing literature to unveil MDD signatures. </p>"
"<p> A systematic literature search was performed up to January 2023. Seventy-three studies on MDD patients reporting GMV abnormalities were included in the first meta-analysis, for a total of 6167 patients and 6237 healthy controls (HC). To test the effects of anxiety comorbidity, we conducted a second meta-analysis, by adding to the original pure MDD sample a new cohort of MDD patients with comorbid anxiety disorders (308 patients and 342 HC). An activation likelihood estimation (ALE) analysis and a coordinate-based mapping approach separate for atrophy and hypertrophy were used to identify common brain structural alterations among patients. </p>"
"<p> The pure MDD sample exhibited atrophy in the left insula, as well as hypertrophy in the bilateral amygdala and parahippocampal gyri. When we added patients with comorbid anxiety to the original sample, bilateral insula atrophy emerged, whereas the hypertrophy results were not replicated. </p>"
"<p> Our findings revealed important structural alterations in pure MDD patients, particularly in the insula and amygdala, which play key roles in sensory input integration and in emotional processing, respectively. Additionally, the amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus hypertrophy may be related to MDD functional overactivation to emotional stimuli, rumination, and overactive self-referential thinking. Conversely, the presence of anxiety comorbidity revealed separate effects which were not seen in the pure MDD sample, underscoring the importance of strict inclusion criteria for investigations of disorder-specific effects.</p>"
"<p>Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the most typical condition among depressive disorders [<a href=""#B1"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B1"">1</a>], where approximately 280 million individuals are affected worldwide [<a href=""#B2"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B2"">2</a>]. Due to its pervasiveness and symptom severity, depression is nowadays a leading cause of disability and significantly contributes to the overall global burden of disease [<a href=""#B3"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B3"">3</a>].</p>"
"<p>Decades of research have enabled the identification of numerous psychosocial, biological, and genetic correlates of MDD, but its pathophysiology remains unclear [<a href=""#B4"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B4"">4</a>]. Nevertheless, the application of neuroimaging techniques such as structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying psychiatric diseases [<a href=""#B5"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B5"">5</a>], together with the advances in automated procedures like voxel-based morphometry (VBM) which allows the objective evaluation of anatomical differences in a whole-brain manner [<a href=""#B6"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B6"">6</a>], has been providing tangible evidence for the neurobiological correlates of MDD. In particular, grey matter volume (GMV) represents a straightforward and reliable measure for the investigation of brain morphometric differences. Using VBM, even focal and subtle differences can be identified between different populations (mainly patients vs. healthy individuals) [<a href=""#B7"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B7"">7</a>]. Indeed, notwithstanding the emergence of more complex techniques, both the structural ones focusing on the connectome properties (e.g., [<a href=""#B8"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B8"">8</a>, <a href=""#B9"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B9"">9</a>]) or the white matter fiber integrity (e.g., [<a href=""#B10"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B10"">10</a>–<a href=""#B12"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B12"">12</a>]) and those performing multimodal connectivity analyses (e.g., [<a href=""#B13"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B13"">13</a>, <a href=""#B14"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B14"">14</a>]), studying GMV keeps providing foundational knowledge about brain organization and architecture, whereby its comprehension is essential for interpreting more complex structural and functional evidence that may involve multiple components. Moreover, structural aberrations in grey matter are likely to be associated with functional alterations, but the reverse process is more ambiguous: for example, impaired connectivity may occur in brains with normal-appearing GMV, as it is the case of disconnection syndromes [<a href=""#B15"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B15"">15</a>]. For these reasons, the volumetric study of grey matter is still an informative method to assess brain changes in psychiatric illnesses, and MDD is one of those disorders where GMV investigation, and VBM, in particular, has contributed the most.</p>"
"<p>Several meta-analyses of whole-brain VBM studies have been published in the last decade, with the aim to summarize the brain structures associated with MDD [<a href=""#B16"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B16"">16</a>–<a href=""#B33"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B33"">33</a>]. Overall, these studies show a distribution of GMV atrophy across both cortical and subcortical regions, such as the cingulate [<a href=""#B16"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B16"">16</a>, <a href=""#B18"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B18"">18</a>–<a href=""#B21"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B21"">21</a>, <a href=""#B23"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B23"">23</a>–<a href=""#B25"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B25"">25</a>, <a href=""#B27"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B27"">27</a>] and prefrontal cortices [<a href=""#B16"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B16"">16</a>, <a href=""#B21"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B21"">21</a>, <a href=""#B23"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B23"">23</a>, <a href=""#B25"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B25"">25</a>, <a href=""#B32"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B32"">32</a>], frontal gyrus [<a href=""#B18"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B18"">18</a>, <a href=""#B19"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B19"">19</a>, <a href=""#B21"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B21"">21</a>, <a href=""#B23"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B23"">23</a>, <a href=""#B24"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B24"">24</a>, <a href=""#B27"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B27"">27</a>, <a href=""#B29"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B29"">29</a>–<a href=""#B31"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B31"">31</a>, <a href=""#B33"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B33"">33</a>], insula [<a href=""#B21"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B21"">21</a>, <a href=""#B23"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B23"">23</a>, <a href=""#B24"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B24"">24</a>, <a href=""#B27"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B27"">27</a>, <a href=""#B29"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B29"">29</a>, <a href=""#B31"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B31"">31</a>], hippocampus [<a href=""#B18"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B18"">18</a>, <a href=""#B21"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B21"">21</a>–<a href=""#B24"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B24"">24</a>, <a href=""#B29"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B29"">29</a>, <a href=""#B30"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B30"">30</a>, <a href=""#B33"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B33"">33</a>], and parahippocampus [<a href=""#B16"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B16"">16</a>, <a href=""#B19"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B19"">19</a>, <a href=""#B21"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B21"">21</a>, <a href=""#B29"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B29"">29</a>, <a href=""#B30"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B30"">30</a>, <a href=""#B33"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B33"">33</a>]. Interestingly, alterations in some of these areas have been associated to specific MDD symptoms, highlighting the role of MRI to study the relationship between brain changes and clinical characteristics of this disorder. For example, reduced hippocampal volume has been associated with deficits in memory performance [<a href=""#B34"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B34"">34</a>] and with increased frequency of episodes or longer illness duration [<a href=""#B35"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B35"">35</a>], while the cingulate cortex has been shown to be crucial in the regulation of affective states [<a href=""#B36"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B36"">36</a>]. Moreover, dysfunctions in the insula—a region known for integrating information from limbic and frontal areas, with its anterior division particularly involved in cognitive and affective processes—have been suggested as a correlate for the lack of cognitive inhibition to negative emotions, rumination, and neuropsychological impairments commonly observed in MDD patients [<a href=""#B37"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B37"">37</a>]. Findings are less consistent in the case of hypertrophy, where only a few whole-brain VBM meta-analyses revealed increased GMV in patients with respect to healthy controls and results were inconsistent across studies. For example, Wise et al. identified greater GMV within the bilateral superior occipital gyrus extending into the cuneus [<a href=""#B21"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B21"">21</a>], while regions of increased volume were observed in the left visual cortex and the right temporoparietal junction by Sha and Banihashemi [<a href=""#B25"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B25"">25</a>], or else in the right lingual gyrus of elderly patients as reported by Du et al. [<a href=""#B33"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B33"">33</a>]. Among studies focusing on first-episode drug-naïve patients, the only convergent result is the GMV increase in the bilateral thalamus, whereas the other findings are still inconsistent [<a href=""#B31"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B31"">31</a>, <a href=""#B32"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B32"">32</a>].</p>"
"<p>However, it should be pointed out that the above-mentioned results come from heterogeneous studies. Notably, most meta-analyses focused on samples including pharmacologically treated patients [<a href=""#B16"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B16"">16</a>–<a href=""#B26"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B26"">26</a>], further subdivided into responders and nonresponders by Liu et al. [<a href=""#B27"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B27"">27</a>]. Conversely, some investigations considered first-episode cases [<a href=""#B28"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B28"">28</a>, <a href=""#B29"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B29"">29</a>] or medication-free patients [<a href=""#B30"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B30"">30</a>], whereas others considered only first-episode drug-naïve patients [<a href=""#B31"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B31"">31</a>, <a href=""#B32"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B32"">32</a>]. A meta-analysis focusing only on late-life depression was also published [<a href=""#B33"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B33"">33</a>]. Moreover, in some instances, broader selection criteria have been used: there are cases in which papers performing small volume correction—a violation of whole-brain analysis because it restricts the search area to a given region of interest—have been included (e.g., [<a href=""#B22"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B22"">22</a>, <a href=""#B23"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B23"">23</a>]), or cases where other factors remained ambiguous, such as the lack of distinction between grey matter density or concentration and GMV (e.g., [<a href=""#B18"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B18"">18</a>, <a href=""#B26"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B26"">26</a>]). Another issue worthy of attention is the presence of clinical samples with a spurious diagnostic profile, for example, by inclusion of remitted patients (e.g., [<a href=""#B25"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B25"">25</a>]), subjects with a treatment-refractory condition (e.g., [<a href=""#B24"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B24"">24</a>]), individuals suffering from secondary depression (e.g., [<a href=""#B21"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B21"">21</a>]), or individuals who manifest subthreshold depressive symptoms (e.g., [<a href=""#B19"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B19"">19</a>]).</p>"
"<p>When assessing the comparability of samples from different investigations, we found that patients with overt anxiety comorbidity were often not excluded. Indeed, despite numerous previous meta-analyses declaring a dual psychiatric diagnosis as an exclusion criterion, we still found traces of samples of MDD patients showing comorbid anxiety [<a href=""#B17"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B17"">17</a>–<a href=""#B21"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B21"">21</a>, <a href=""#B24"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B24"">24</a>, <a href=""#B25"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B25"">25</a>, <a href=""#B28"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B28"">28</a>, <a href=""#B30"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B30"">30</a>–<a href=""#B32"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B32"">32</a>]. Although the link between anxiety and depression is undoubted [<a href=""#B38"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B38"">38</a>] with estimated concurrency in about 46% of depressed individuals [<a href=""#B39"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B39"">39</a>], anxiety and depression are distinct mental disorders, characterized by specific diagnostic criteria [<a href=""#B1"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B1"">1</a>], and with different clinical and pharmacological treatments. As a consequence, anxiety disorders might have a specific role in affecting brain structures when co-occurring with MDD, and they should be treated like any other comorbid pathologies.</p>"
"<p>The present study is aimed at studying the brain correlates of MDD in its most characterizing symptomatology. Therefore, we conducted a novel meta-analysis of whole-brain VBM studies on a “pure” MDD sample (i.e., depressed patients without any comorbidities), carefully applying strict inclusion criteria in order to eliminate confounding factors as much as possible. However, anxious symptoms during MDD have been found in 50-60% of cases [<a href=""#B40"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B40"">40</a>, <a href=""#B41"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B41"">41</a>]; hence, our pure MDD subjects were allowed to exhibit anxiety symptoms as long as the criteria for a secondary diagnosis were not fulfilled. Starting from this, we hypothesized that an overt comorbidity between MDD and an anxiety disorder might have a different impact than the simple co-occurrence of anxious symptoms during depressive episodes. This is particularly important considering that anxiety disorders have been associated with both shared and distinct structural alterations when compared with MDD. A comprehensive review of MRI studies revealed, among other brain structures, decreased volumes of the hippocampus, anterior cingulate cortex, insula, and amygdala in patients suffering from anxiety disorders [<a href=""#B5"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B5"">5</a>]. The authors also highlighted how the variety of the etiopathogenesis among pathological subtypes and the presence of comorbidities can bias the results, preventing generalization [<a href=""#B5"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B5"">5</a>]. Indeed, when focusing on subtypes of anxiety disorders—separate from MDD—specific alterations have appeared. For example, a recent whole-brain VBM meta-analysis found lower GMV in the thalamus and striatum of patients with social anxiety disorder, but reduced GMV in prefrontal and temporoparietal cortices, thalamus, striatum, and brainstem, together with increased GMV in temporo-parieto-occipital and prefrontal cortices of patients with panic disorder [<a href=""#B42"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B42"">42</a>]. Therefore, to disclose any potential difference, we conducted a second meta-analysis by adding to the original pure MDD sample a group of MDD patients who also revealed a comorbidity to any of the DSM axis-I anxiety disorders.</p>"
"<p>The present work represents, to the best of our knowledge, the most complete and updated coordinate-based meta-analysis (CBMA) on MDD. All the studies on the matter published up to 31 January 2023, documenting alterations (both reduction and increase) of GMV at the whole-brain level, have been systematically searched, rigorously screened, and finally analyzed using an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) approach. The final aim is to improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of MDD, with an additional focus on the effects of co-occurrence of anxiety on brain grey matter.</p>"
"<p>A systematic and extensive literature search was carried out in PubMed before the end of January 2023 to identify potential studies according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines [<a href=""#B43"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B43"">43</a>].</p>"
"<p>The keywords used for the literature search were as follows: (1) (major depression OR major depressive disorder OR MDD) AND (voxel) AND (morphometry), (2) (major depression OR major depressive disorder OR MDD) AND (structural MRI OR sMRI), and (3) (major depression OR major depressive disorder OR MDD) AND (gray matter volume OR grey matter volume). The procedure returned 2111 records. Additionally, we inspected the complete reference lists of the previous meta-analyses on the matter [<a href=""#B16"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B16"">16</a>–<a href=""#B33"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B33"">33</a>]. This final check did not reveal other studies than those obtained with the PubMed search.</p>"
"<p>Studies were included if they met the following inclusion criteria: (1) they were published in peer-reviewed journals in English, (2) they compared MDD patients with healthy controls (HC), (3) they reported GMV abnormalities using sMRI (studies with no significant results were excluded, as well as studies investigating GM concentration or density), (4) they performed whole-brain VBM analysis (i.e., ROI or small volume correction analyses were not included), (5) they reported stereotactic coordinates in MNI or Talairach space (when the coordinates or the direction of the contrast between patients and HC was not clearly reported, we contacted the corresponding authors; in case of no response, these papers were excluded), (6) they did not investigate any kind of depression different from MDD (e.g., subthreshold depression, secondary depression, peripartum/postpartum depression, psychotic or bipolar depression, dysthymic disorder, or premenstrual dysphoric disorder; we also excluded patients in remission or in euthymic state and those who were treatment-resistant), and (7) they included patients with no overt physical, neurological, or psychic comorbidities. To ensure results belonging to a “pure” MDD sample, we first excluded patients with any comorbid anxiety disorders—but not those showing anxious symptoms. After that, we retrieved the discarded publications to examine the effect produced by adding patients with both disorders to the original sample.</p>"
"<p>To achieve maximum research coverage and a sample as representative as possible of the clinical population, we did not impose limitations on age (although 95% of the reports included in the final pool analyzed participants whose age was above 18 and below 65) or medication status. We also included studies performing different subgroup comparisons, as long as patient samples were not overlapping.

Notably, the number of healthy individuals here reported was obtained by counting them only once in case of studies performing different patients' subgroup comparisons with the same HC group (e.g., [<a href=""#B44"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B44"">44</a>]).</p>"

"<p>Selected studies reported either decreases or increases in GMV, or both in some cases.

In the case of GMV hypertrophy in patients compared to HC, 29 papers (23 of which also found atrophy) returned this result; no different subgroup comparisons were performed; thus, the final number of included contrasts was 29.</p>"
"<p>To test the effects of anxiety comorbidity, we retrieved studies based on samples with dual diagnosis (<em>n</em> = 6) and an additional subsample affected by anxious comorbidity present in Qi et al. [<a href=""#B64"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B64"">64</a>] previously discarded (<a href=""#tab1"" class=""usa-link"">Table 1</a>).

"<p>In compliance with the guidelines by Müller et al.

We carried out two different meta-analyses, the first one on the pure MDD sample and the second one on the MDD+A sample. Both of them were in turn subdivided into two meta-analyses performed separately, one for GMV atrophy and the other for GMV hypertrophy of patients compared to HC.</p>"
"<p>To weight study contributions, GingerALE uses sample sizes and coordinates, which must be expressed in the same stereotactic space; therefore, the first step consisted in converting Talairach coordinates into MNI space using the “convert foci” option provided in the GingerALE interface. Then, the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) method [<a href=""#B126"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B126"">126</a>] was performed under the software to quantitatively assess the interstudy concordance. The ALE approach assesses the spatial convergence of reported coordinates across the experiments against the null hypothesis that the findings follow a random spatial distribution. The coordinates, or foci, are treated as three-dimensional Gaussian probability distributions centered at the given coordinates to generate per-experiment modeled atrophy/hypertrophy maps, which are subsequently joined in a union map [<a href=""#B124"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B124"">124</a>, <a href=""#B127"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B127"">127</a>]. For each Gaussian distribution, the algorithm derives full-width half-maximum by considering the sample size of every single study. Finally, ALE tests for above-chance spatial convergence through a range of available thresholding options. In our meta-analyses, we set a statistical ALE map threshold for significance using cluster-level family-wise error (FWE) correction at <em>p</em> &lt; 0.05 (5000 permutations), with cluster-forming threshold of <em>p</em> &lt; 0.01. Forasmuch as each coordinate referred to the contrast between two groups (patients vs. healthy controls), the analysis relied on the <em>n</em> of the smaller of the two samples to yield a more conservative activation likelihood estimation [<a href=""#B128"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B128"">128</a>].</p>"
"<p>Patients included in the pure MDD sample (<em>n</em> = 6167, 60.2% females) were 34.9 years old on average, the diagnosis of major depression was mostly based on the DSM criteria [<a href=""#B1"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B1"">1</a>] (the remaining used the ICD [<a href=""#B129"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B129"">129</a>]), and they had no overt physical, neurological, or psychiatric comorbidities. The severity of depression was assessed with Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD) [<a href=""#B130"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B130"">130</a>] in most cases, but also Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) [<a href=""#B131"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B131"">131</a>], Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) [<a href=""#B132"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B132"">132</a>], and Zung's Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) [<a href=""#B133"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B133"">133</a>] were sometimes administered. In the 18 included studies, anxious symptomatology—which did not reach the diagnostic threshold for an anxiety disorder diagnosis—was present too and typically measured with Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) [<a href=""#B134"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B134"">134</a>]; other scales used were Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) [<a href=""#B135"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B135"">135</a>], Zung's Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) [<a href=""#B136"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B136"">136</a>], and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) [<a href=""#B137"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B137"">137</a>]. During the course of illness, 1222 patients were drug-naïve, 1343 were drug-free (The <em>drug-naïve</em> patients have no prior history of drug treatment -most are first-episode patients- whereas the <em>drug-free</em> patients also include those who received pharmacological treatment in the past but were untreated at the time of the structural MRI acquisition -including, for example, patients who had suspended therapy or were in a “washout” condition), and 2284 were medicated; for the remaining patients, no information about drug status was available. In general, healthy controls were matched to the depressed patients demographically. Indeed, the HC recruited in the comparison studies (<em>n</em> = 6237) were similar to MDD patients regarding age (mean HC age = 34.11) and sex distribution (57% females).</p>"
"<p>Patients with comorbid anxiety added in the second meta-analysis (<em>n</em> = 308, 62% females) were 36.9 years old on average, and they all met the DSM criteria. Any other comorbidity was excluded.

The medication status was heterogeneous: in two studies, patients were drug-naïve, in three others drug-free, and in the last two under current treatment. The demographics of healthy subjects (<em>n</em> = 342) and MDD+A individuals were similar (mean HC age = 36.43, sex distribution = 64.6% females). See <a href=""#tab1"" class=""usa-link"">Table 1</a> for more detailed info.</p>"
"<p>The first meta-analysis was carried out on 73 contrasts (derived from 67 papers) that included 407 foci and compared 5509 pure MDD patients showing GMV atrophy versus 6618 HC (here, healthy individuals were counted twice in case of contrasts between two different subgroups of patients and the same HC group, as each contrast is taken into account separately). The minimum size for a cluster to be considered statistically significant was 2000 mm<sup>3</sup>. The minimum cluster size considered significant in the analyses is automatically calculated by the software GingerALE using the thresholding algorithm of cluster-level inference, which simulates random datasets using the characteristics of the original dataset: number of foci, number of foci groups, and subject sizes. By setting a threshold of <em>p</em> &lt; 0.01, GingerALE finds above that threshold the contiguous volumes, “clusters,” and tracks the distribution of their volume. The cluster-level inference-corrected threshold sets the cluster minimum volume such that only, for example, 5% of the simulated data's clusters exceed this size. In other words, cluster-level inference uses a cluster forming threshold (<em>p</em> &lt; 0.01) and the distribution of cluster sizes above the threshold to choose a minimum cluster size. Our results revealed a region of convergence of 3064 mm<sup>3</sup> centered in the left insula (MNI coordinates: <em>X</em> = −47.3, <em>Y</em> = 9.1, <em>Z</em> = −1.7), with four peaks, three of which were located in the left insula (corresponding to Brodmann area (BA) 13) and one in the left superior temporal gyrus (BA 22). The maximum ALE value (0.0341, <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001; <em>z</em> = 5.54) was found within the left insula (MNI coordinates: <em>X</em> = −46, <em>Y</em> = 12, <em>Z</em> = −8). <a href=""#tab2"" class=""usa-link""> Table 2</a> provides a summary of all significant results. <a href=""#fig2"" class=""usa-link""> Figure 2</a> shows that the significant cluster was lateralized in the left hemisphere and that it included the insula and the superior temporal gyrus.</p>"

The first cluster of 1696 mm<sup>3</sup> was centered in the left parahippocampal gyrus (MNI coordinates: <em>X</em> = −14.7, <em>Y</em> = −4.2, <em>Z</em> = −15.5) with three peaks, all of them belonging to the left parahippocampal gyrus (BA 28/BA 34). The maximum ALE value (0.0121, <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001; <em>z</em> = 3.84) was found within the left parahippocampal gyrus (MNI coordinates: <em>X</em> = −14, <em>Y</em> = −8, <em>Z</em> = −16). The second cluster of 1688 mm<sup>3</sup> was centered in the right parahippocampal gyrus (MNI coordinates: <em>X</em> = 22.4, <em>Y</em> = −1.3, <em>Z</em> = −16.8) with three peaks (right BA 28/BA 34 and right amygdala), and the maximum ALE value (0.0156, <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001; <em>z</em> = 4.38) was found within the right parahippocampal gyrus (MNI coordinates: <em>X</em> = 22, <em>Y</em> = 2, <em>Z</em> = −16). A summary of all significant results is provided in <a href=""#tab3"" class=""usa-link"">Table 3</a>, whereas <a href=""#fig3"" class=""usa-link"">Figure 3</a> shows the significant clusters including the left and right parahippocampal gyri and amygdala.</p>"

<p>Results obtained from the meta-analysis focused on grey matter volume increase in pure MDD patients compared to HC.</p>
"<p>This meta-analysis was conducted on 79 contrasts (derived from 73 papers) including 442 foci and comparing 5797 MDD+A patients showing reduced GMV versus 6960 HC (also here, healthy individuals were counted twice in case of contrasts between two different subgroups of patients and the same HC group, as each contrast is taken into account separately). The minimum size for a cluster to be considered statistically significant was 2304 mm<sup>3</sup>. The results showed two regions of convergence. The first cluster, 4216 mm<sup>3</sup> in size, was centered in the right insula (MNI coordinates: <em>X</em> = 42.6, <em>Y</em> = 10.8, <em>Z</em> = −7.1) and had eight peaks distributed among the insula (BA 13), superior temporal gyrus (BA 21), temporal lobe (BA 38), and claustrum, all in the right hemisphere. The maximum ALE value (0.027, <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001; <em>z</em> = 4.65) was located in the right insula (MNI coordinates: <em>X</em> = 38, <em>Y</em> = 22, <em>Z</em> = −4). The second cluster was 2952 mm<sup>3</sup> and centered in the left insula (MNI coordinates: <em>X</em> = −47.9, <em>Y</em> = 8.8, <em>Z</em> = −1.8) with four peaks, three of which localized in the left insula (BA 13) and one in the left superior temporal gyrus (BA 22). The maximum ALE value (0.0341, <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001; <em>z</em> = 5.47) was found in the left insula (MNI coordinates: <em>X</em> = −46, <em>Y</em> = 12, <em>Z</em> = −8). <a href=""#tab4"" class=""usa-link""> Table 4</a> lists all significant peaks, and <a href=""#fig4"" class=""usa-link"">Figure 4</a> displays the significant clusters.</p>"

<p>Results obtained from the meta-analysis focused on grey matter volume loss in MDD+A patients compared to HC.</p>
"<p>A second meta-analysis on 2238 MDD+A patients showing higher GMV compared to 3148 HC was conducted, comprising 31 contrasts (derived from 31 papers) for a total of 73 foci, but in this case, no statistically significant clusters were found.</p>"
"<p>Finally, an exploratory analysis on the six experiments in which patients with comorbid MDD and one overt anxiety disorder showed GMV atrophy when compared with HC has been carried out (see Supplementary materials). We did not consider the cases of hypertrophy due to the even more exiguous number.</p>"
"<p>In the present CBMA study, four independent meta-analyses were performed, two of which focused on GMV atrophy and the other two on GMV hypertrophy, with the primary aim of clarifying the specific mechanisms underlying MDD in its purest symptomatologic manifestation and, as a complementary analysis, unveiling the critical role of comorbid anxiety. This last analysis is essential to disclose whether comorbid anxiety has a different impact on MDD brain structures than the simple co-occurrence of anxious symptoms during depressive episodes.</p>"
"<p>For our main analysis, the rigorous application of strict inclusion criteria permitted us to carry out a greater control of several confounding factors which have often been neglected in previous meta-analyses. Specifically, this includes the investigation of GMD or GMC rather than GMV (it is good practice to keep these values separate [<a href=""#B139"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B139"">139</a>]) and the inclusion of patients suffering from a form of depression different from MDD, or affected by anxiety comorbidity.</p>"
<p>The analysis of our pure MDD sample and similar healthy adults revealed two important findings: depressive patients exhibited both GMV atrophy and hypertrophy.</p>
"<p>Our meta-analysis of GMV loss included data from more than 5500 pure MDD patients and revealed an atrophic region centered in the left insula. Although numerous previous whole-brain meta-analyses [<a href=""#B16"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B16"">16</a>–<a href=""#B33"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B33"">33</a>] identified GMV atrophy in depressed patients, some of their results were discordant. These inconsistencies might be related to less stringent inclusion criteria, with the consequent presence of spurious samples with anxiety comorbidity. In fact, when we added patients with comorbid anxiety to our pure MDD sample, <em>bilateral</em> insula atrophy emerged. Interestingly, as GingerALE software reveals which studies contribute to the results, we noticed that one-third of the studies contributing to the right insula hub included patients with comorbidities. In other words, although the sample of patients with comorbidities was only 11% as large as the pure MDD sample (288/5509), their contribution was proportionally very large since the right insula hub did not emerge in the pure MDD sample. In contrast, only one of the studies contributing to the left hub belonged to the MDD+A sample. Considering these ratios and the fact that the left insula cluster was the main atrophic result of our pure MDD meta-analysis, we suggest that the left insula might predominately be affected in MDD patients, whereas the right insula might be less specific of MDD and rather associated with comorbid anxiety disorder. Furthermore, the exploratory analysis carried out on the small sample of MDD with anxiety disorder comorbidity revealed significant GMV atrophy in the right parahippocampal/subcallosal gyrus (see Table <a href=""#supplementary-material-1"" class=""usa-link"">S1</a> and Figure <a href=""#supplementary-material-1"" class=""usa-link"">S1</a> in the supplementary materials). This finding should be interpreted with caution, considering the very limited sample size of patient and control groups in the exploratory analysis. However, this analysis also reveals a reduced GMV in a right region, supporting a possible association between atrophy of the right hemisphere circuits and anxiety disorder comorbidity in MDD patients.</p>"
"<p>Regardless of its hemispheric location, it is important to note that our results converged in finding atrophy in the insula. The insula has wide connections with several brain areas involved in a variety of cognitive processing (e.g., [<a href=""#B140"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B140"">140</a>, <a href=""#B141"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B141"">141</a>]) and has central position in emotional responses [<a href=""#B142"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B142"">142</a>]. However, the insula also participates in language, sensory-motor, decision-making, salience, and attentional processing (e.g., [<a href=""#B143"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B143"">143</a>–<a href=""#B145"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B145"">145</a>]). Furthermore, the insula special function of (external) sensory input integration to the emotional processing in the limbic system supports its integral role for interoception—i.e., the awareness of the internal bodily state. This process represents the mechanism underlying humans' ability to perceive themselves as something different from the surrounding environment, allowing people to be aware of themselves, and finally to distinguish the image of “self” from “not oneself” [<a href=""#B146"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B146"">146</a>–<a href=""#B148"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B148"">148</a>]. In particular, the anterior portion of the insula is critical for processing the emotional component of interoception awareness, mainly depending on its connection with limbic regions [<a href=""#B149"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B149"">149</a>, <a href=""#B150"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B150"">150</a>].</p>"
"<p>Notably, a recent meta-analysis revealed that important structural dysfunctions in left insula and temporofrontal regions contributed to the severity and persistence of schizophrenia auditory verbal hallucinations [<a href=""#B151"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B151"">151</a>]. Furthermore, an atypical functional activation of the right insula was found in both hallucinating schizophrenia patients [<a href=""#B152"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B152"">152</a>] and euthymic bipolar patients [<a href=""#B153"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B153"">153</a>]. Considering that language lateralization is a crystallized characteristic of the human brain [<a href=""#B154"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B154"">154</a>], a reduced GMV of left insula could alter the whole network and contribute to the confusion in processing internally and externally generated sensory/emotional experiences, thus possibly explaining several symptoms characterizing the most severe psychiatric disorders (e.g., semantic anomalies, thought disorders, ruminations, and auditory hallucinations).</p>"
"<p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the most complete and updated meta-analysis that compared pure MDD patients showing hypertrophy with respect to healthy controls. We found hypertrophy in the bilateral amygdala and parahippocampal gyri in the pure MDD sample. This result, although still limited, is the newest and most promising one, given the recent and growing interest in structural hypertrophy. Past relevant studies from the ENIGMA MDD Consortium provided evidence of subcortical brain atrophy in a region close to this hub, i.e., the hippocampus [<a href=""#B35"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B35"">35</a>, <a href=""#B155"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B155"">155</a>, <a href=""#B156"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B156"">156</a>]. Notably, these analyses were all carried out focusing on specific ROIs, including a small cluster of subcortical brain regions, not following a whole-brain approach. In their recent review, Schmaal et al. found reduced hippocampal volume in MDD patients compared with controls, with a modest effect size [<a href=""#B35"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B35"">35</a>]. Interestingly, hippocampal atrophy appeared related to long-lasting, persistent, and recurring forms of MDD, characterized by progressive worsening of the disorder, rather than to a premorbid vulnerability factor [<a href=""#B35"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B35"">35</a>].</p>"
"<p>The involvement of these areas in major depression has been widely investigated, especially in light of their functional role: the parahippocampal gyrus and the amygdala are part of a circuitry where emotion and memory functions have a mutual modulatory effect [<a href=""#B157"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B157"">157</a>]. Consistent with this, cognitive theories suggest that memory biases of depressed individuals (e.g., greater access to negative autobiographic material) may interfere with emotion regulation strategies, and vice versa [<a href=""#B158"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B158"">158</a>]. In particular, the parahippocampal gyrus is a region of the limbic system that has a main role in episodic memory and information processing, with a direct involvement in elaborating visuospatial data [<a href=""#B159"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B159"">159</a>]. Furthermore, the parahippocampal region is characterized by numerous connections—with frontal, parietal, and temporal areas—which explain its key involvement in high-level cognitive functions, such as the processing of contextual associations [<a href=""#B160"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B160"">160</a>]. Among its network of connections, the parahippocampus has been also linked to the default mode system [<a href=""#B161"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B161"">161</a>], whose role in depressive symptoms has received wide consensus [<a href=""#B162"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B162"">162</a>]. Furthermore, the default mode network with its self-referential nature (i.e., excessive self-inspection and internal and external monitoring) has been suggested as a neural basis of rumination in MDD [<a href=""#B163"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B163"">163</a>], in the form of repetitive thinking over minor past failings, self-loathing, or guilty preoccupations [<a href=""#B1"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B1"">1</a>]. Interestingly, Cooney et al. found that the parahippocampal activity was higher in depressed patients than healthy individuals during rumination [<a href=""#B164"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B164"">164</a>], whereas Zamoscik et al. found that greater connectivity between the parahippocampus and default mode network in MDD patients was related to a sadder mood and more ruminative thoughts [<a href=""#B165"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B165"">165</a>]. A comprehensive hypothesis suggests that the parahippocampal gyrus might be hyperactivated in depression because of its key role in rumination and autobiographical memory—the highly self-referential part of episodic memory—with a specific focus on negative episodes, thereby leading to the negative-valence emotions typical of MDD [<a href=""#B165"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B165"">165</a>].</p>"
"<p>Notably, also the amygdala has been associated with rumination [<a href=""#B166"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B166"">166</a>] and overactive self-referential thinking [<a href=""#B167"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B167"">167</a>], functional activities that fit with its main role in affective control [<a href=""#B168"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B168"">168</a>]. The amygdala has been indeed recognized as a crucial component of the brain circuitry underlying emotion [<a href=""#B169"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B169"">169</a>], and its specific hyperactivity elicited by negative emotions has long contributed to the investigation of its involvement in depression [<a href=""#B170"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B170"">170</a>]. For example, numerous functional imaging studies have shown that depressed individuals exhibit exaggerated amygdala reactivity to negative stimuli (e.g., [<a href=""#B171"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B171"">171</a>–<a href=""#B173"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B173"">173</a>]) and that, compared to healthy controls, these responses are maintained for a longer period of time [<a href=""#B167"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B167"">167</a>]. Together with this, the amygdala is a key hub in memory and learning processes, reward mechanisms, and social behavior [<a href=""#B174"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B174"">174</a>], which are all aspects known to be impaired in MDD [<a href=""#B175"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B175"">175</a>]. Notably, some previous studies reporting enlarged amygdalar volumes in depressed patients (e.g., [<a href=""#B176"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B176"">176</a>–<a href=""#B178"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B178"">178</a>]), comprising also first-episode or recent-onset individuals, mutually agreed in speculating that the enlargement might result from elevated resting metabolism and overactivation in response to emotional stimuli.</p>"
"<p>Interestingly, it has been shown that treatment-resistant patients often show a functional restoration of both the parahippocampal gyrus and the amygdala when treated with more invasive approaches (e.g., ECT) [<a href=""#B179"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B179"">179</a>, <a href=""#B180"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B180"">180</a>]. We therefore wondered whether our hypertrophy results depend on drug response, but what emerged from a “post hoc quality check” of the GingerALE output is that most of the contributing studies included only drug-free patients. Contrary to what we expected, our results revealed that hypertrophy was not a secondary phenomenon to pharmacological treatment. Then, a highly speculative interpretation of our results is that patients' hypertrophy represents a biomarker of pure MDD and not of their treatment response. In other words, some subcortical circuits, mainly involved in negative-valence emotional processing, are hyperstimulated by the disease symptoms, thus leading to an increased GMV. In the present study, it was not possible to carry out an in-depth analysis to further distinguish between drug-free patients (i.e., patients who had suspended therapy or were in a washout condition) from drug-naïve patients (i.e., patients with no prior history of drug treatment)—and it was not the main purpose of the present work—because many studies did not clarify this aspect, others defined drug-naïve patients as drug-free, and still others carried out multicenter researches on patients with various drug status and provided limited (when present) information on patients' pharmacological condition. The possible key role of drugs on hypertrophy results also appears considering the MDD+A meta-analysis, in which only 50 patients with anxiety comorbidity were added. Although the number of comorbidity patients was small, the result obtained for the pure MDD sample was not replicated. As comorbidity patients usually undergo multiple drug treatments, as they are characterized by more severe clinical pictures, a possible interpretation is that the addition of spurious participants may obscure the effects that appear spontaneously in a group of pure ones.</p>"
"<p>In conclusion, increasing the sample size might not necessarily make the analysis statistically more powerful, as it might add a level of variance capable of modifying the results and their interpretation. In our specific case, we suggest that including data that make the pure sample spurious may produce less reliable results. In fact, the presence of an overt comorbidity between MDD and anxiety (unlike the occurrence of anxious symptoms only) in the MDD+A meta-analyses may have produced effects not specifically attributable to major depression.</p>"
"<p>Our work highlights the importance of using rigorous and stringent inclusion criteria for participant enrollment, in particular considering MDD patients with anxious comorbidity. From a more general perspective, the present study corroborates the importance of relying on neuroimaging methodologies for investigating the neurobiological mechanisms that underlie psychiatric disorders, but also for their clinical applications in diagnosis and treatment. In particular, neuroimaging findings can help to redefine diagnostic boundaries [<a href=""#B181"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B181"">181</a>] and may provide markers of prognosis and monitor therapies, in an attempt to identify neural system abnormalities characterizing treatment-relevant endophenotypes [<a href=""#B182"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B182"">182</a>]. Finally, they can provide the rationale for the development of specific neurostimulation approaches [<a href=""#B183"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B183"">183</a>]. For example, considering our specific results, insula might be proposed—as has already been for other psychiatric conditions [<a href=""#B184"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B184"">184</a>]—as a possible target for brain stimulation in MDD patients thanks to advancements in technology that allow for noninvasive stimulation of deeper brain areas (such as the insula). As neurostimulation techniques have widely demonstrated their effectiveness for MDD [<a href=""#B185"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B185"">185</a>] and insular alterations have been consistently found across MDD studies, suggesting their putative key role in depression's pathophysiology, patients could concretely benefit from an intervention of deep stimulation targeted to this region, within which repeated sessions may induce long-lasting synaptic plasticity. Therefore, future studies might consider investigating insular stimulation as a treatment for MDD.</p>"
"<p>The present study has some limitations. First, only six studies met all our inclusion criteria for MDD patients with anxiety comorbidities. However, they led to important changes in our results. By adding future studies, it might be possible to disambiguate pure MDD brain correlates from those influenced also by anxiety comorbidity. Second, in our work, we explored the contribution of drug status only qualitatively, mainly because it was not possible to distinguish between drug-free patients and drug-naïve patients. Future studies may clarify this aspect, investigating results depending on pharmacological effects from those specific to MDD. Third, GingerALE software utilizes a coordinate-based approach, and the datasets for atrophy and hypertrophy are considered in separate analyses. The inclusion of studies with no significant results (<em>n</em> = 24 out of 35 no results/unsuitable contrasts in <a href=""#fig1"" class=""usa-link"">Figure 1</a>) is not allowed, preventing us from estimating the risk of publication bias.</p>"
"<p>Notwithstanding these limiting factors, a clear pattern of left insula atrophy and bilateral amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus hypertrophy in pure depressive patients are noteworthy results deserving attention for future studies that aim at shedding light on anatomical correlates of mental disorders.</p>"

"<p>Research has demonstrated that higher social support is associated with better psychological health, quality of life, cognition, activities of daily living, and social participation, but the relationship between social support and sleep quality remains unknown. This study aims to investigate the mediating effects of anxiety and depression in the relationship between social support and sleep among community-dwelling patients with schizophrenia.</p>"
"<p>Purposive sampling was used to collect face-to-face data from 1,107 community-dwelling patients with schizophrenia in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China, between April and July 2023. The Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) was used to assess sleep quality; the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7) was utilized to evaluate anxiety symptoms; and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) was employed to assess depressive symptoms. The mediating effect of anxiety and depression symptoms was assessed using the bootstrap method via Model 6 (Serial multiple mediator model) of the SPSS PROCESS macro.</p>"
"<p>Among the 1,107 participants, the proportions of people with schizophrenia experiencing anxiety, depressive symptoms, and poor sleep quality were 22.8, 37.7, and 42.1%, respectively. Mediation analyses indicated that although social support had no direct effect on sleep quality, anxiety and depressive symptoms fully mediated the relationship between social support and sleep quality.</p>"
"<p>Patients with schizophrenia experience low levels of social support and poor sleep quality. To enhance the sleep quality of individuals with schizophrenia, all levels of society (government, medical institutions, and communities) must pay more attention to mental health. Implementing diverse intervention measures to strengthen social support and improve symptoms of anxiety and depression should be considered. This approach may potentially lead to an improvement in sleep quality among individuals with schizophrenia.</p>"

"<p>The sleep issue is a global public health issue of great concern. According to studies, the prevalence of sleep disturbance in the general population ranges from 9.2 to 15.5%, negatively affecting people’s ability to function socially and their overall quality of life (<a href=""#ref1"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref1"">1</a>, <a href=""#ref2"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref2"">2</a>). Sleep disturbance is common in psychiatric disorders (<a href=""#ref3"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref3"">3</a>). Approximately 30–80% of individuals with schizophrenia suffer from some form of disturbed sleep, such as difficulties initiating or maintaining sleep (<a href=""#ref4"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref4"">4</a>). The most obvious manifestations of sleep abnormalities among patients with schizophrenia include increased sleep latency, reduced total sleep time, and reduced sleep efficiency (<a href=""#ref5"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref5"">5</a>).</p>"
"<p>Research has shown that the association between sleep quality and schizophrenia is bidirectional (<a href=""#ref6"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref6"">6</a>). People with schizophrenia often experience poor sleep quality, and poor sleep quality may exacerbate schizophrenia symptoms (<a href=""#ref7"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref7"">7</a>). Sleep problems in schizophrenia are associated with worse health outcomes (<a href=""#ref8"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref8"">8</a>, <a href=""#ref9"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref9"">9</a>), including cognitive dysfunction (<a href=""#ref10"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref10"">10</a>), more severe psychiatric disorders (<a href=""#ref11"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref11"">11</a>), metabolic disturbances (<a href=""#ref12"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref12"">12</a>), and impaired quality of life (<a href=""#ref13"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref13"">13</a>). Evidence suggests that targeted insomnia interventions can help reduce psychiatric symptoms and improve functional outcomes (<a href=""#ref14"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref14"">14</a>). These findings highlight the importance of screening and managing sleep problems in people with schizophrenia. Moreover, it is essential to investigate the potential modifiable factors that influence or facilitate sleep.</p>"
"<p>The reasons behind the poor sleep quality experienced by patients with schizophrenia are diverse and can be complex. Research has identified multiple factors that impact the sleep quality of individuals with schizophrenia. Known risk factors encompass sociodemographic variables (<a href=""#ref15"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref15"">15</a>), disease-related factors (<a href=""#ref16"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref16"">16</a>), lifestyle choices (<a href=""#ref9"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref9"">9</a>), environmental influences (<a href=""#ref17"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref17"">17</a>), and psychosocial aspects (<a href=""#ref18"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref18"">18</a>). In recent years, psychosocial factors have garnered extensive attention as potential modifiable elements. Psychological factors can mitigate sleep disturbances through the self-regulation of emotions, thereby reducing the prevalence of sleep issues. However, current research primarily focuses on negative psychological indicators, such as anxiety and depression, which are common comorbidities in schizophrenia (<a href=""#ref19"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref19"">19</a>, <a href=""#ref20"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref20"">20</a>). Not only do they contribute to the worsening of schizophrenia’s primary symptoms, but they also have a detrimental impact on sleep quality (<a href=""#ref21"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref21"">21</a>). The interrelation between poor sleep, heightened anxiety, and increased depression creates a vicious cycle, further impairing individuals’ ability to engage with their treatment and recovery (<a href=""#ref22"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref22"">22</a>, <a href=""#ref23"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref23"">23</a>). There is a limited understanding of how protective psychosocial factors, such as social support, influence sleep quality in patients with schizophrenia.</p>"
"<p>Social support is a multidimensional concept, typically referring to the receipt of material or emotional support and assistance from others (<a href=""#ref24"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref24"">24</a>). Social support can directly protect mental health through the benefits of social relationships, or it can serve as a buffer against external pressures, thereby indirectly safeguarding psychological well-being (<a href=""#ref25"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref25"">25</a>). Research indicates that high levels of social support can enhance individuals’ ability to cope with stress and alleviate anxiety and depression by improving sleep quality (<a href=""#ref26"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref26"">26</a>, <a href=""#ref27"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref27"">27</a>).</p>"
"<p>Research suggests that the relationship between perceived social support and sleep quality is influenced by the impact of social support on reducing adverse psychological reactions, such as anxiety and depression, and improving health status (<a href=""#ref28"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref28"">28</a>). Specifically, poor sleep quality is associated with higher levels of anxiety and depression, whereas higher levels of social support are linked to reductions in these symptoms, thereby enhancing sleep quality (<a href=""#ref29"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref29"">29</a>, <a href=""#ref30"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref30"">30</a>). Similarly, research among medical personnel highlighted the importance of social support in buffering against work-related stressors, ultimately leading to improved mental health and sleep outcomes (<a href=""#ref31"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref31"">31</a>). Additionally, studies of medical students found that anxiety and depression mediate the relationship between perceived stress and sleep quality (<a href=""#ref32"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref32"">32</a>). In stroke patients, anxiety and depression also play a mediating role between social support and sleep quality (<a href=""#ref33"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref33"">33</a>). While the relationship between social support and sleep quality has been explored in various populations, less attention has been given to community-dwelling individuals with schizophrenia. Moreover, the potential mediating roles of anxiety and depression symptoms in this relationship remain underexplored. Understanding these mediating mechanisms is crucial, as it can inform targeted interventions to improve sleep quality and overall well-being in this vulnerable population.</p>"
"<p>This study addresses a critical gap in the literature by elucidating the complex interactions between social support, sleep quality, and psychological symptoms in schizophrenia. By identifying the mediating roles of anxiety and depression, our research offers potential pathways for interventions aimed at enhancing social support mechanisms to improve sleep quality and reduce psychological distress among community-dwelling schizophrenics. Thus, this study contributes to broader efforts to improve mental health outcomes and quality of life for individuals living with schizophrenia.</p>"
"<p>In this article, we propose a comprehensive model to illustrate how social support is associated with sleep quality. The main hypotheses to be tested in this integrated model are: (1) social support was negatively related to sleep quality; (2) social support was negatively related to anxiety symptoms; (3) social support was negatively related to depression symptoms; (4) anxiety symptoms were positively related to sleep quality; and (5) depression symptoms were positively related to sleep quality. This study is based on a cross-sectional survey of the mental health of patients with schizophrenia in communities in Chengdu, China, with the aim of testing a comprehensive model of social support, anxiety, depression, and sleep quality.</p>"
"<p>This was a cross-sectional study conducted from April to July 2023. Prior to the commencement of this study, we had obtained approval from the Ethics Committee of West China Fourth Hospital, Sichuan University. The study employed a convenience sampling method to recruit participants from communities in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China. Convenience sampling is a specific type of non-probability sampling method that relies on collecting data from populations that are conveniently available to participate in the study, and it is most commonly used in quantitative research (<a href=""#ref34"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref34"">34</a>). It is most commonly used in quantitative studies. A total of 1,107 patients with schizophrenia were recruited, with the inclusion criteria being: (1) meets the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia according to the Tenth Revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10); and (2) consents to participate in this study. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) presence of other severe mental disorders, organic brain diseases, or mental retardation; (2) refusal to sign the informed consent form; and (3) communication disorders.</p>"

"<p>The 10-item Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS) was used to assess the level of social support in patients with schizophrenia (<a href=""#ref35"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref35"">35</a>). The scale consists of three dimensions: subjective support, objective support and support utilization. Subjective support: This dimension assesses perceived emotional and informational support from family and friends (Items 2, 6, 7). Objective support: This dimension includes items that measure tangible support such as financial aid and material assistance (Items 1, 3, 4, 5). Support utilization: This dimension evaluates how well participants utilize the available support (Items 8 to 10). Each entry is categorized into 4 levels in ascending order, with corresponding scores of 1, 2, 3, and 4. The total scores ranged from 12 to 66, with higher scores being associated with higher levels of social support, and the specific scores corresponding to the levels are shown in <a href=""#tab1"" class=""usa-link"">Table 1</a>. The SSRS has been widely applied to the Chinese population and has been proven to possess good internal consistency.

"<p>The data were entered using EpiData software, with two individuals independently entering and consistently coding the questionnaires to ensure data quality. All analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics version 26.0 (Armonk, NY, USA). A two-tailed significance level was set at <em>α</em> = 0.05. Continuous variables were presented as mean ± standard deviation, while categorical variables were expressed as frequencies (n) and percentages (%). Pearson’s correlation analysis was used to test the correlation between social support, anxiety, depression, and sleep, where the variables input are the scores obtained according to the corresponding scales, which are continuous variables. We used the four-step mediation effects test proposed by (<a href=""#ref43"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref43"">43</a>) to analyze mediation effects based on hierarchical multiple regression. The method provides clear steps, is easy to implement, and can significantly improve the identification and interpretation of the role of mediating variables, thus providing a comprehensive understanding of the mediating mechanism. Firstly, the preliminary mediation effect was determined through the four-step test: (1) testing the relationship between the independent variable (social support) and the dependent variable (sleep quality); (2) testing the relationship between the independent variable (social support) and the mediator variables (anxiety and depression); (3) testing the relationship between the mediator variables (anxiety, depression) and the dependent variable (sleep quality); and (4) testing whether the relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable significantly weakens or becomes non-significant after adding the mediator variables. In the analysis, we applied the statistical method developed by Preacher and Hayes, known as the Bootstrap method for mediating effect testing (specifically Model 6). This method was used to examine whether a mediating variable influences the relationship between an independent variable and a dependent variable. To ensure the robustness and accuracy of their results, we performed 5,000 iterations (“resamples”) of the data. From these iterations, we calculated a 95% confidence interval (CI) that is corrected for any potential biases, providing a range within which the true mediating effect is likely to fall. In addition, we also randomly selected subsets from the data to similarly perform mediated effects analysis to again verify the robustness of the results.</p>"

When the explained variance rate of the first factor in the Harman one-factor test results exceeds 40%, it can be assumed that there is a large bias in the results of the common method. The explained rate of the first factor in this study is 17.98%, which is lower than 40% and below the test standard, and it can be assumed that there is no serious common method bias effect in the results of this questionnaire.</p>"

"<p>This study aims to explore the relationships between social support, anxiety, depression, and sleep quality among schizophrenia patients living in communities in Chengdu, China. The main focus of our attention is the effect of social support on sleep quality in psychiatric patients and dedicated to explaining the role that anxiety and depression play in this. The results of correlation and hierarchical multiple regression analyses showed that social support has a significant effect on sleep quality among community-dwelling schizophrenia patients directly. However, the effect of social support on sleep quality was no longer significant when both anxiety and depression are included, highlighting the complex interactions between mental health and sleep in this population.</p>"
"<p>The results of this study, as shown by correlation analysis and multivariate hierarchical analysis, indicated a significant positive correlation between the symptoms of anxiety and depression and the degree of insomnia in schizophrenia patients. Specifically, symptoms of anxiety and depression were directly associated with poor sleep quality in schizophrenia patients, which is consistent with previous studies. The severity of insomnia worsens with increasing anxiety symptoms in populations with poorer emotional regulation (<a href=""#ref45"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref45"">45</a>). Thus, schizophrenics patients are at higher risk of experiencing anxiety and depression compared to the general population (<a href=""#ref46"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref46"">46</a>). The reason for this is that, firstly, anxiety can lead to excessive rumination and worry, making it difficult to fall asleep at night or causing frequent awakenings (<a href=""#ref47"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref47"">47</a>). Secondly, symptoms of depression, such as feelings of low mood and loss of interest, can disrupt normal sleep patterns and structures, leading to early waking or excessive sleep. Furthermore, anxiety and depression may increase patients’ sensitivity to negative stimuli, further exacerbating sleep disturbances (<a href=""#ref48"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref48"">48</a>). Overall, the presence of these symptoms creates a vicious cycle that worsens the sleep problems of schizophrenia patients, thus affecting their daytime functioning and quality of life (<a href=""#ref15"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref15"">15</a>, <a href=""#ref49"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref49"">49</a>, <a href=""#ref50"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref50"">50</a>). Therefore, healthcare workers should pay attention to the negative emotional experiences of schizophrenia patients, such as anxiety and depression, and provide follow-up visits and emotional counseling to patients with these characteristics. Similarly, we learn that there is a significant negative relationship between the level of social support obtained by schizophrenic patients and anxiety depression via the study results, which demonstrates the importance of a good level of social support in maintaining a well-being psychological state among schizophrenia patients, as reported in other studies. In addition, based on the negative relationship between social support and anxiety and depression, and the positive relationship between anxiety and depression and insomnia, we can reasonably propose our research goal: the important role of anxiety and depression in the effect of social support on sleep.</p>"
"<p>Social support has been shown to indirectly influence sleep quality through the regulation of mental health in populations such as adolescents, healthcare workers, and stroke patients (<a href=""#ref29"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref29"">29</a>, <a href=""#ref31"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref31"">31</a>, <a href=""#ref33"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref33"">33</a>). Similarly, our study reveals the same pattern in schizophrenia patients, validated by hierarchical multiple regression analyses and serial mediation model. The study demonstrated that anxiety and depression play a fully mediating role between social support and sleep quality, with anxiety and depression having a significant mediating effect on sleep quality through three specific pathways. The pathway “social support → depression → sleep quality” had the highest proportion of effects. Depression is strongly associated with decreased sleep quality, which is proven by extensive research (<a href=""#ref51"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref51"">51</a>, <a href=""#ref52"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref52"">52</a>). High levels of social support is recognized as an important external resource for promoting physical and mental health, providing emotional comfort, practical help, and cognitive support, thus reducing patients’ depressive symptoms (<a href=""#ref53"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref53"">53</a>). With the reduction of depressive symptoms, patients’ negative emotions and thoughts decreased, and sleep patterns and structures gradually returned to normal, which in turn improved sleep quality. Thus, social support had the most significant effect on sleep quality through the mediating variable of depression. The findings also raise important implications for clinical practice. Specifically, interventions that only target sleep disorders in specific groups, such as schizophrenia, may not produce optimal outcomes if they ignore broader psychological and social factors. As such, a more comprehensive approach is warranted to evaluate and address the psychosocial well-being and sleep quality of patients with schizophrenia.</p>"
"<p>In the context of the high prevalence of poor sleep in schizophrenia patients, this study explored the relationship between social support, anxiety, depression, and sleep in schizophrenia patients, confirming the fully mediating role of anxiety and depression in the relationship between social support and sleep. These findings highlight the complex mechanisms by which social support affects sleep quality by addressing underlying mental health problems, and also further refine previous research findings on the detrimental effects of anxiety and depression on sleep quality in different groups. Social support can indirectly affect sleep quality in schizophrenia patients via anxiety and depression. Specifically, increasing the level of social support has the potential to reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression, improving sleep quality in schizophrenia patients. This study may provide potential insights and guidance for the development and implementation of intervention strategies and measures to improve sleep quality in schizophrenia patients.</p>"
"<p>Our findings advocate the development and implementation of diverse interventions aimed at increasing levels of social support, reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression, and, through these means, improving sleep quality. Further research should endeavor to explore the specific effects of different types and sources of social support on the quality of sleep in people with schizophrenia and how these supports can be effectively integrated into existing treatment and care practices. In addition, the results of this study emphasize the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration, given the significant impact of psychosocial factors on sleep quality in schizophrenia patients. Coordinated efforts among mental health professionals, social workers, community-based organizations, and family members are essential for the development and implementation of effective support plans. Through this collaboration, a comprehensive supportive environment can be created to help individuals with schizophrenia improve their sleep quality and their overall quality of life. Finally, this study highlights the necessity of public health education. By raising awareness of schizophrenia and its associated sleep problems among the public, healthcare providers, and policymakers, more effective resource allocation and support strategies can be developed to meet the complex requirements of people with schizophrenia.</p>"
"<p>Our study also has some limitations. Firstly, the subjects of this study were only from the community of Chengdu, which may limit the generalizability of our findings. Secondly, the variables such as “social support,” “anxiety,” “depression,” and “sleep” were all subjectively reported by the participants, which could lead to information bias. The hierarchical multiple regression and Baron and Kenny’s four-step mediation effects test methods assume that the relationships between variables are linear. If in reality there are nonlinear relationships between variables, this method may not accurately identify and interpret these relationships, leading to inaccurate or confusing results. In addition, multiple tests in the four-step approach may also increase the risk of type I errors (false positives). Fourth, the relationship between social support and sleep quality is complex. In addition to the symptoms of anxiety and depression, there may be other mediating variables. Future research should focus on identifying these mediating variables to more systematically and clearly understand the pathways through which social support affects sleep quality.</p>"

"<p id=""Par1"">Depression is a common and devastating neuropsychiatric symptom in the elderly and in patients with dementia. In particular, nearly 80% of patients with Alzheimer’s Disease dementia experience depression during disease development and progression. However, it is unknown whether the depression in patients with dementia shares the same molecular mechanisms as depression presenting as primary psychiatric disease or occurs and persists through alternative mechanisms. In this review, we discuss how the clinical presentation and treatment differ between depression in dementia and as a primary psychiatric disease, with a focus on major depressive disorder. Then, we hypothesize several molecular mechanisms that may be unique to depression in dementia such as neuropathological changes, inflammation, and vascular events. Finally, we discuss existing issues and future directions for investigation and treatment of depression in dementia.</p>"

"<p id=""Par2"">Dementias, with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) as the most common type, are often thought of solely as disorders of progressive cognitive decline [<a href=""#CR1"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR1"">1</a>]. However, over 90% of people with AD develop neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) during the disease process, and NPS are now considered a key component of AD [<a href=""#CR2"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR2"">2</a>, <a href=""#CR3"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR3"">3</a>]. NPS are a heterogeneous group of symptoms that may present at any stage of the disease and include depression, apathy, anxiety, agitation, aggression, disinhibition, and delusions/hallucinations [<a href=""#CR4"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR4"">4</a>]. In those with AD, the severity of NPS is correlated with increased cognitive decline [<a href=""#CR5"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR5"">5</a>, <a href=""#CR6"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR6"">6</a>] and can worsen general health [<a href=""#CR7"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR7"">7</a>], reduce patient and caregiver quality of life, trigger institutionalization, and increase mortality [<a href=""#CR6"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR6"">6</a>, <a href=""#CR8"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR8"">8</a>]. Additionally, NPS can occur in patients with very early forms of dementia, as NPS can be identified in 35–85% of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) [<a href=""#CR9"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR9"">9</a>–<a href=""#CR12"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR12"">12</a>]. NPS can be the presenting symptoms of dementia, and researchers have developed the concept of mild behavioral impairment (MBI) to address this phenomenon [<a href=""#CR13"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR13"">13</a>]. MBI can occur at any point along the pre-dementia cognitive spectrum from normal cognition to MCI and is characterized by late life onset of persistent NPS [<a href=""#CR14"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR14"">14</a>].</p>"
"<p id=""Par3"">Clinically, doctors struggle with limited pharmacological treatment options for NPS in AD, almost all of which are off-label and with low success rates [<a href=""#CR15"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR15"">15</a>, <a href=""#CR16"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR16"">16</a>]. Currently, NPS medications mainly target monoaminergic neurotransmission, often focusing on dopaminergic, noradrenergic, and serotonergic signaling (e.g. selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, alpha-1 antagonists, and atypical antipsychotics) [<a href=""#CR17"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR17"">17</a>–<a href=""#CR19"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR19"">19</a>]. However, these approaches can have significant medical and cognitive side-effects in an elderly patient population, with aging-related pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic factors for this increased risk [<a href=""#CR4"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR4"">4</a>, <a href=""#CR20"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR20"">20</a>, <a href=""#CR21"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR21"">21</a>]. Concerns regarding the higher mortality rate observed in dementia patients prescribed antipsychotics has prompted the FDA to require a “black box” warning for use in this vulnerable population [<a href=""#CR22"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR22"">22</a>]. It is therefore urgent to identify the mechanisms underlying NPS to inform development of novel therapeutic approaches with higher efficacy and safety profiles.</p>"
"<p id=""Par4"">Affective symptoms, including depression and anxiety, are the most common NPS in AD [<a href=""#CR23"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR23"">23</a>]. In one study, the 5-year-period prevalence was greatest for depression (77%), apathy (71%), and anxiety (62%), though 97% experienced at least one NPS [<a href=""#CR23"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR23"">23</a>]. These affective symptoms may also be the ones that develop more frequently before clinically relevant cognitive decline [<a href=""#CR24"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR24"">24</a>]. While depression and apathy may co-occur—and while apathy and anhedonia, a core depression symptom, may be hard to disambiguate – it is not uncommon for affective symptoms and apathy to present individually in AD [<a href=""#CR25"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR25"">25</a>–<a href=""#CR27"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR27"">27</a>]. However, despite the ubiquity of these symptoms in even mild AD, the underlying mechanisms of such symptoms receive much less attention in both research and clinical practice than memory deficits [<a href=""#CR28"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR28"">28</a>].</p>"
"<p id=""Par5"">In this review, we discuss the differences in clinical presentation and treatment of depression in dementia and as a primary psychiatric disease (PPD), mainly focusing on major depressive disorder (MDD). Then, we hypothesize which molecular mechanisms may be unique to depression in dementia, drawing heavily on studies of late life depression and burgeoning cognitive decline, as investigations into depression in dementia as its own disease are rare. Finally, we discuss future directions for investigation and treatment of depression in dementia.</p>"
"<p id=""Par6"">When adult depression is considered in a clinical context, the most common diagnosis applied is MDD. This diagnosis requires inclusion of at least one of two major symptoms – dysphoria or anhedonia – and four other major or minor symptoms including sleep disturbance, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, changes in appetite, fatigue or reduced energy, psychomotor agitation or slowing, suicidal ideation, and trouble concentrating or deciding [<a href=""#CR29"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR29"">29</a>, <a href=""#CR30"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR30"">30</a>]. However, not all those with symptoms of “depression” are given an MDD diagnosis, and the savvy clinician’s differential diagnosis is broad, including consideration of bipolar disorders, negative symptoms in schizophrenia, personality disorders with special focus on cluster B, adjustment disorder and demoralization (though not an official diagnosis, this is considered frequently in consult and liaison psychiatry), medication- and substance-induced depression, delirium, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, postpartum depression, and depression due to other medical conditions (e.g. vascular and heart disease, hypothyroidism, malignancy, autoimmune diseases, neurologic disorders). The purpose of mentioning these other diagnoses is to underscore the heterogeneous presentations of depression as a part of larger syndromes and to highlight the importance of classification as a guide in understanding etiology and treatment. For instance, there are certain new medications such as brexanolone that are mechanistically specific to the neurosteroid dysregulation that occurs in postpartum depression [<a href=""#CR31"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR31"">31</a>–<a href=""#CR33"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR33"">33</a>], and treating depression due to hypothyroidism is much more efficient with thyroid hormone replacement [<a href=""#CR34"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR34"">34</a>] than standard antidepressants. Even demoralization, which often mimics MDD in hospital settings, is often more responsive to supportive psychotherapy than pharmacotherapy [<a href=""#CR35"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR35"">35</a>]. Even among those appropriately diagnosed with MDD, many have hypothesized that the heterogeneous etiologies could lead to future sub-classifications that would lead to more efficient treatments [<a href=""#CR36"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR36"">36</a>, <a href=""#CR37"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR37"">37</a>].</p>"
"<p id=""Par7"">Clinically, disambiguating MDD from depression in dementia is also an important diagnostic task. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V) is relatively unspecific in its diagnosis of depression in cognitive disorders like dementia, with the diagnoses of ‘Major’ or ‘Minor Neurocognitive Disorder with behavioral disturbance’ as the official classification. There is no further specification of these behavioral disorders in the DSM-V, despite the wide range of NPS from agitation and aggression to frank psychosis [<a href=""#CR29"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR29"">29</a>]. Even the more expansive set of diagnostic classifications in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) specify various types of dementia with ‘mood disturbance such as depression, apathy, or anhedonia,’ but still without clear codes for each symptom. While these might seem like small shortcomings, the efficacy and modality of treatments can vary considerably for those with depression in dementia and those with MDD and may vary even more across NPS.</p>"
"<p id=""Par8"">Similar to other NPS, first-line pharmacotherapy for MDD centers on monoamine manipulating drugs, usually ones that increase serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine [<a href=""#CR38"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR38"">38</a>, <a href=""#CR39"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR39"">39</a>]. Though the placebo effect is often large in clinical trials evaluating their efficacy, there is a clear treatment response to these medications for MDD. Surprisingly, when these same medications have been tried in those with depression in dementia, mostly AD, they have failed to show significant improvements compared to placebo. One of the most rigorous clinical trials to demonstrate this lack of efficacy was the Health Technology Assessment Study of the Use of Antidepressants for Depression in Dementia (HTA-SADD), which treated over a hundred patients in each group with either placebo, the selective-serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) sertraline, and the atypical serotonergic modulator mirtazapine. Despite a clear effect, neither medication showed a significant improvement over placebo at 13 or 39 weeks after initiation [<a href=""#CR40"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR40"">40</a>]. A 2018 Cochrane review similarly found no benefit of antidepressants for treating depression in dementia, though there was moderate-quality evidence of higher remission rates. Despite this, patients treated with antidepressants showed greater dropout due to adverse effects, which complicates the interpretation of remission rates, as those patients with positive response may have been more likely to remain in the studies. They conclude that based on the high-quality evidence from depression rating scale scores, antidepressants showed little or no effect [<a href=""#CR41"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR41"">41</a>]. The smaller studies in this Cochrane review showed no benefits of antidepressants and included SSRIs [<a href=""#CR40"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR40"">40</a>, <a href=""#CR42"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR42"">42</a>–<a href=""#CR44"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR44"">44</a>], mirtazapine [<a href=""#CR40"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR40"">40</a>], the serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor venlafaxine [<a href=""#CR45"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR45"">45</a>, <a href=""#CR46"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR46"">46</a>], and tricyclic antidepressants [<a href=""#CR47"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR47"">47</a>, <a href=""#CR48"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR48"">48</a>]. A network meta-analysis in 2021 described similar findings when including antidepressant and non-pharmacological treatments [<a href=""#CR49"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR49"">49</a>]. While pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic factors related to drug side effects, such as the epigenetic changes our laboratory uncovered with antipsychotics [<a href=""#CR50"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR50"">50</a>–<a href=""#CR52"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR52"">52</a>], may play a role in limiting the tolerated dose and leading to undertreatment, many of these trials reached adequate doses to treat MDD in otherwise healthy individuals. Given these differences in treatment response, it seems reasonable to hypothesize that the molecular etiologies of depression in dementia and PPDs are different. However, it would also be reasonable to hypothesize that antidepressants treat depression in dementia or in MDD through different but convergent mechanisms, and it is this pathway that is no longer responsive in depression in dementia.</p>"
"<p id=""Par9"">Before discussing the evidence of contrasting depression etiologies in dementia and MDD, it is important to consider the confounding effect of apathy on depression classification in both the clinic and research. While depression is characterized by dysphoria or anhedonia as core features, apathy may be mood-independent and is better conceptualized by loss of motivated behaviors. Levy and Dubois [<a href=""#CR53"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR53"">53</a>] strongly recommend a definition of apathy as “the quantitative reduction of self-generated voluntary and purposeful behaviors.” They stress that apathy is best defined by diminished goal-directed behaviors, and while this can be a consequence of depression, apathy can and does exist without dysphoria or anhedonia. Indeed, the difficulty in the separation of these two symptoms is well represented in a systematic review of 62 studies that clustered NPS in dementia based on symptom co-occurrence [<a href=""#CR54"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR54"">54</a>]. In 35 studies that used the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) to evaluate NPS, 17 studies suggested apathy as its own domain while 15 suggested it be grouped with the affective domain, encompassing dysphoria and anxiety predominantly. Finally, while pharmacological treatments for depression in dementia are lacking, methylphenidate has been shown to improve apathy in dementia via the Apathy in Dementia Methylphenidate Trial (ADMET) [<a href=""#CR55"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR55"">55</a>, <a href=""#CR56"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR56"">56</a>], though the dopaminergic reuptake inhibitor bupropion, traditionally used to treat depression, did not reduce apathy [<a href=""#CR57"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR57"">57</a>]. This evidence suggests that apathy may be quite distinct etiologically from depression, but the high rate of mis- or cross-diagnosis could affect the ability to disentangle the respective etiologies of depression in the contexts of dementia and PPD. Setting this possibility aside, we will next explore possible divergent molecular and cellular etiologies of depression in dementia.</p>"
"<p id=""Par10"">While the number of studies investigating molecular and cellular mechanisms of depression in dementia are sparse, there is a wide range of research into late-life depression (LLD). LLD refers to depression occurring in older adults (usually 60–65 years old) and has diverse presentations. Many studies (or reviews) have been conducted on LLD as a stand-alone classification of major depression [<a href=""#CR58"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR58"">58</a>–<a href=""#CR66"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR66"">66</a>] and a few general points of consensus are worth considering in interpreting these studies from the perspective of depression in dementia.</p>"
"<p id=""Par11"">First, many authors note that LLD could be a risk factor for dementia or a prodrome of a neurodegenerative process that has yet to affect cognition, especially in the case of late-onset depression. After decades of study, many authors have concluded that splitting these possibilities is fallacious and endorse the likelihood that both phenomena exist [<a href=""#CR60"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR60"">60</a>, <a href=""#CR61"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR61"">61</a>, <a href=""#CR67"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR67"">67</a>]. This has even been studied in a systematic review, which concluded that both hypotheses were plausible, possibly even in heterogeneous ways for each hypothesis [<a href=""#CR60"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR60"">60</a>, <a href=""#CR61"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR61"">61</a>, <a href=""#CR67"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR67"">67</a>]. One of the most convincing single population studies of this duality is the Multi Institutional Research of Alzheimer’s Genetic Epidemiology (MIRAGE) study [<a href=""#CR68"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR68"">68</a>], which found that the risk of AD with depression was more pronounced in those with later onset. Specifically, when depression symptoms presented 1 year before AD, the odds ratio (OR) was 4.57 (CI<sub>95</sub> 2.87–7.31); and when greater than 1 year, the OR was 1.38; (CI<sub>95</sub> 1.03–1.85). At the earliest time point of onset 25 years prior to AD, the OR was 1.71 (CI<sub>95</sub> 1.03–2.82), suggesting that depression may also be a risk factor for dementia. The elevated risk for dementia with late-life onset versus midlife onset has been replicated many times with different approaches [<a href=""#CR69"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR69"">69</a>–<a href=""#CR71"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR71"">71</a>]. By comparing the intervals between depression and dementia onset, we see that there are potentially two groups of patients that both display elevated risks of dementias, but one group’s risk may be due to long-term depression etiologies impacting brain health while the other may reflect early dementia symptoms that would not have presented without significant neurodegeneration. With the likelihood that some LLD cases are driven or exacerbated by neurodegenerative processes, understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms of this phenomena can shed light on what might be causing depression in dementia. For those interested in depression as a risk factor for dementia, there have been a number of excellent reviews [<a href=""#CR60"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR60"">60</a>, <a href=""#CR61"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR61"">61</a>, <a href=""#CR63"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR63"">63</a>].</p>"
"<p id=""Par12"">The second aspect of late-life dementia that is generally agreed upon amongst authors is that there is a higher likelihood of cognitive dysfunction [<a href=""#CR58"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR58"">58</a>, <a href=""#CR66"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR66"">66</a>, <a href=""#CR72"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR72"">72</a>]. While conventional teaching suggested that depression in older people can cause a reversible cognitive impairment called pseudodementia, the clinical histories of these patients are more nuanced. In a recent meta-analysis, it was shown that while 53% do have improvement in depression and cognitive symptoms, another 33% have “irreversible dementia” [<a href=""#CR73"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR73"">73</a>]. This hints at the potential for significant heterogeneity in late-life depression in terms of pathological etiology and helps to explain some initially conflicting epidemiological data concerning cognitive impairment and dementia with depression. While depression in dementia has been consistently tied to greater cognitive decline than in those without [<a href=""#CR74"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR74"">74</a>], there has been an apparent disconnect in conversion rates from MCI to dementia in those with and without depression. A rigorous meta-analysis of 15 community-based studies and 20 clinic-based studies showed an apparent paradox in dementia conversion based on study type [<a href=""#CR75"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR75"">75</a>], where there was an increased Risk Ratio (RR) in community- but not clinic-based studies. Recontextualized from the perspective of pseudodementia vs prodrome, it may be hypothesized that those with pseudodementia are more likely to present in clinic-based studies while those in the community have a higher percentage of prodromal dementia. The most important distinction that follows from these observations is that studies that embrace heterogeneity in LLD may be better able to understand what specific etiologies lead to depression in dementia, and it may be that certain clinical or treatment characteristics could better identify which sub-populations to study.</p>"
"<p id=""Par13"">This segues to the last point of agreement amongst authors reviewing LLD: Certain clinical and treatment characteristics are more common in LLD. Some of these characteristics may inform which patients are more likely to have neurodegenerative etiologies. Many agree that LLD portends a poorer response to conventional antidepressants than depression in younger adults [<a href=""#CR58"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR58"">58</a>–<a href=""#CR60"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR60"">60</a>, <a href=""#CR66"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR66"">66</a>, <a href=""#CR76"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR76"">76</a>, <a href=""#CR77"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR77"">77</a>], and this hints that potentially those with treatment-resistant depression could be more likely to develop dementia in the future, as a neurodegenerative etiology may be driving the disease. Clinically, many studies have found that those with LLD are more likely to exhibit executive dysfunction, reduced motivation and higher rates of anhedonia, lack of insight, mild vegetative symptoms, and psychomotor retardation and slowed gait [<a href=""#CR58"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR58"">58</a>, <a href=""#CR59"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR59"">59</a>]. However, it has been suggested that those who go on to develop dementia may have subtle verbal fluency and memory deficits distinct from the proposed dysexecutive phenotype in LLD [<a href=""#CR78"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR78"">78</a>]. Others highlight the presence of melancholy as predicting more incipient dementia or cognitive decline, though the sample sizes and methodology make this evidence less robust [<a href=""#CR79"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR79"">79</a>, <a href=""#CR80"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR80"">80</a>].</p>"
"<p id=""Par14"">In addition, there has been consistent evidence that those with LLD are less likely to have a family history of MDD [<a href=""#CR81"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR81"">81</a>], potentially underlying that the mechanism of their depression is less genetically influenced because neurodegenerative etiologies are more predominant factors. At first this may seem puzzling or counterintuitive, especially if one ascribes to the hypothesis that depression in dementia emerges due to loss of an “emotional reserve,” analogous to the concept of cognitive reserve that is often used to describe one’s susceptibility or resistance to neurodegeneration-mediated loss of cognition. However, the polygenic risk correlation between MDD and AD are small, with the most recent and highly powered study finding only an r<sup>2</sup> of 0.029 [<a href=""#CR82"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR82"">82</a>]. In addition, if only AD cases by diagnosis were examined and not those by proxy, no relationship was found (r =  − 0.02, p = 0.73). Previous Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) attempts found no genetic correlation between MDD and AD nor did AD polygenic risk scores associate with late-onset depression risk [<a href=""#CR83"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR83"">83</a>]. It should be noted that no study addressed all-cause dementia nor depression in dementia. Still, a similar phenomenon was noted for psychosis in AD, where a recent GWAS found that those with genetic risk for schizophrenia and in later analyses bipolar disorder were less likely to have psychosis in dementia [<a href=""#CR84"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR84"">84</a>, <a href=""#CR85"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR85"">85</a>].</p>"
"<p id=""Par15"">It remains unclear which of these clinical and treatment factors could separate late-life depression of neurodegenerative etiology from other processes, but we would hypothesize that treatment resistance to conventional antidepressants, late-onset depression, and lack of family history are the most likely factors to suggest an individual at higher risk of later neurodegenerative dementia. Recognizing these factors could be helpful for the geriatrician in terms of prognosis and treatment planning as well as those designing future cohort studies to investigate molecular mechanisms of depression in dementia. For our purposes, we will highlight these features in studies of LLD that could be germane to the molecular or cellular etiologies of depression in dementia.</p>"
"<p id=""Par16"">It is well accepted that protein aggregations define most dementias neuropathologically, and accumulating evidence suggests a causal role for these proteinopathies in dementia progression [<a href=""#CR86"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR86"">86</a>]. Specifically, amyloid-beta (Aβ) is associated with AD [<a href=""#CR87"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR87"">87</a>]; hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) with AD and frontotemporal dementia [<a href=""#CR88"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR88"">88</a>]; alpha-synuclein with Dementia with Lewy Bodies and Parkinson’s Disease Dementia [<a href=""#CR89"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR89"">89</a>]; and TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) with Frontotemporal Dementia and Limbic predominant Age-related TDP-43 Encephalopathy (LATE) [<a href=""#CR90"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR90"">90</a>]. In addition, positron emission tomography (PET) tracers that bind to these pathological aggregates are gaining traction in clinical practice after being employed in research for many years [<a href=""#CR91"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR91"">91</a>–<a href=""#CR94"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR94"">94</a>]. Finally, the levels of these pathological molecules in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have been helpful in defining certain dementias clinically, though the utility of analyzing other biofluids like plasma are less clearly related to disease [<a href=""#CR91"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR91"">91</a>, <a href=""#CR93"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR93"">93</a>, <a href=""#CR95"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR95"">95</a>, <a href=""#CR96"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR96"">96</a>]. While these molecules have been investigated extensively in terms of cognition and dementia-onset, they have not been as well explored in NPS like depression. Therefore, it is helpful to consider their correlations in MCI or AD with depression.</p>"
"<p id=""Par17"">In terms of AD, there isn’t a clear relationship between Aβ and p-tau with depression. In a 2019 systematic review, it was noted that out of 16 studies examining the relationship between Aβ and depression in MCI or AD, 13 found no correlations [<a href=""#CR97"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR97"">97</a>]. Similarly, 6 out of 7 studies looking for a correlation with p-tau found no association. Finally, it concluded that 7 out of 8 studies found no evidence of t-tau changes in CSF and depression in MCI or AD. In terms of soluble Aβ in CSF, another group reported similar findings of no clear relationship between Aβ and depression in 15 studies of late-life MDD [<a href=""#CR98"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR98"">98</a>]. Similar null findings have been found in longitudinal cohorts with post-mortem analyses. One of the most well-cited due to its size is from the Religious Order Studies/Memory and Aging Project/Minority Aging Research Study (ROS/MAP/MARS) [<a href=""#CR99"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR99"">99</a>–<a href=""#CR101"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR101"">101</a>]. Despite finding that elevated depressive symptoms and MDD were associated with a higher risk of developing dementia, in their final analysis in 2016, they found that only amyloid plaques correlated with MDD (OR = 1.392, CI<sub>95</sub> 1.088, 1.780) but not elevated depressive symptoms. When stratified by those who developed dementia, there was no association of amyloid plaque burden with depression. They further found no associations between depression and neurofibrillary tangles, hippocampal sclerosis, gross infarcts, microinfarcts, nor Lewy bodies. In the end, they concluded ""LLD is not associated with dementia-related pathology,” titling their final paper as such.</p>"
"<p id=""Par18"">Over the last 5 years, continued investigation of AD-related markers and depression have been undertaken, and generally the lack of clear correlation remains the same, especially for MCI and AD [<a href=""#CR102"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR102"">102</a>, <a href=""#CR103"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR103"">103</a>]. However, some studies have added nuance to this conclusion. When studying cognitively normal populations with LLD, some associations with pathological forms of Aβ have been found [<a href=""#CR104"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR104"">104</a>–<a href=""#CR109"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR109"">109</a>], while some studies still find no correlation [<a href=""#CR110"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR110"">110</a>–<a href=""#CR112"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR112"">112</a>]. Though interpretation of these results is challenging, one explanation could be that early AD pathological hallmarks are associated with depression-onset in some individuals because these early symptoms are actually prodromal for AD. Without cognitive impairment, those with late-onset depression may be differentiated by AD neuropathological change as likely to progress to dementia. However, when MCI or AD dementia are already present, differentiating based on AD neuropathological change is insufficient because the burden is already high and leads to broad dementia symptoms. In this setting, the specific presentation of depression amongst those with cognitive impairment relies on another undiscovered molecular mechanism that may be parallel or orthogonal to AD neuropathological change. However, it should be noted that PET and CSF studies were more likely to find associations than those based on post-mortem pathology. While the relationship between AD pathology and depression is tenuous, the relationship between AD pathology and anxiety [<a href=""#CR111"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR111"">111</a>, <a href=""#CR113"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR113"">113</a>–<a href=""#CR116"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR116"">116</a>] or apathy [<a href=""#CR111"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR111"">111</a>, <a href=""#CR115"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR115"">115</a>, <a href=""#CR117"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR117"">117</a>] is more often reported, though outside the scope of this review. It should be noted that the 2019 review of AD pathology and affective symptoms found less correlations for anxiety or apathy with AD pathology than more recent studies [<a href=""#CR97"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR97"">97</a>].</p>"
"<p id=""Par19"">The link between Lewy Body pathology and depression in dementias has been more consistent than with AD pathology. For one, it has often been reported that there exist greater rates of depression in those with Lewy Body Dementia than those with AD [<a href=""#CR118"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR118"">118</a>–<a href=""#CR122"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR122"">122</a>], though this was not found in all cohorts [<a href=""#CR123"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR123"">123</a>, <a href=""#CR124"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR124"">124</a>]. In addition, greater Lewy Body pathology was found in certain subcortical areas such as the substantia nigra and amygdala in those with dementia and depression [<a href=""#CR100"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR100"">100</a>, <a href=""#CR125"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR125"">125</a>–<a href=""#CR127"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR127"">127</a>], though there are exceptions when Lewy Bodies are considered across the whole brain instead of individual regions [<a href=""#CR99"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR99"">99</a>, <a href=""#CR123"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR123"">123</a>]. One study found increased alpha-synuclein in the plasma of MDD patients [<a href=""#CR128"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR128"">128</a>].</p>"
"<p id=""Par20"">It is interesting to note that for patients with Parkinson’s Disease, first-line antidepressants are shown to be efficacious [<a href=""#CR129"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR129"">129</a>], but this positive effect may not extend to Lewy Body Dementia [<a href=""#CR130"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR130"">130</a>] and contrasts with AD [<a href=""#CR39"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR39"">39</a>]. Monoaminergic deficits and increased degeneration of locus coeruleus and substantia nigra cells have been reported more consistently in Lewy Body disease with depression [<a href=""#CR131"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR131"">131</a>–<a href=""#CR134"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR134"">134</a>] or when the source of cognitive impairment is not specified [<a href=""#CR100"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR100"">100</a>, <a href=""#CR135"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR135"">135</a>, <a href=""#CR136"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR136"">136</a>] than in AD [<a href=""#CR137"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR137"">137</a>, <a href=""#CR138"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR138"">138</a>], which has more conflicting results. It is possible that when depression is caused solely by Lewy Bodies, such as in Parkinson’s Disease, more typical antidepressant strategies are helpful, but when depression is influenced by other processes, as in most dementias, these same strategies are less efficacious. However, this would either cast doubt on Lewy Bodies being the cause of depression in mixed dementias, such as when they are found in AD, or that alternative neurodegenerative pathways inhibit the typical antidepressant response. These remain open questions.</p>"
"<p id=""Par21"">Very little is known about TDP43 pathology and depression, with only two studies examining the subject. The first looked at individuals with AD + LATE pathology versus AD pathology only and found no differences in depression, though the timing of psychiatric evaluation was done at diagnosis and not close to death [<a href=""#CR139"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR139"">139</a>].

Further analysis of TDP43’s contribution to depression in dementia is likely warranted.</p>"
"<p id=""Par22"">Even before a substantial number of GWAS hits implicated immunity in AD pathogenesis [<a href=""#CR141"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR141"">141</a>–<a href=""#CR143"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR143"">143</a>], researchers had suspected the immune system might be tightly intertwined with neurodegeneration. Similarly, while the monoamine and hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis hypotheses of depression dominated the late twentieth century, many researchers noted aberrant immune function was correlated with some MDD presentations and that depression was more common in those with co-morbid autoimmune disorders [<a href=""#CR144"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR144"">144</a>]. Increasingly, more researchers have hypothesized that inflammation might be the mechanistic link between depression and dementia [<a href=""#CR145"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR145"">145</a>]. Supporting this, treatment resistant depression often correlates with high inflammatory markers in MDD [<a href=""#CR146"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR146"">146</a>–<a href=""#CR148"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR148"">148</a>] as well as being a feature of depression in dementia [<a href=""#CR40"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR40"">40</a>].</p>"
"<p id=""Par23"">Especially in the periphery, numerous studies have found inflammatory markers to be altered in dementias, MDD, and LLD, including changes in pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and cell-surface markers of immune cell differentiation [<a href=""#CR144"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR144"">144</a>, <a href=""#CR149"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR149"">149</a>–<a href=""#CR166"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR166"">166</a>]. The lists of these differing blood or CSF markers continue to grow, but it includes IL1B, IL2, IL6, IL8, IL10, IL12, IL17, IL18, IL1RA, CCL2/MCP1, CCL3/MIP1A, TNF, TGFB, IFNG, sTREM2, sTNF2, and CRP in both dementia and MDD; IL1A, IL3, IL11, IL22, IL23, CCL5/RANTES, CCL7/MCP3, CCL15/MIP1G, CCL18/PARC, CCL20(MIP3G), M-CSF, G-CSF, IP10/CXCL10, sTNF1, and TRAIL-R4 in dementia; and IL1RA, sIL2, IL3, IL4, IL5, IL9, IL13, IL15, and MIF in MDD [<a href=""#CR144"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR144"">144</a>, <a href=""#CR148"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR148"">148</a>–<a href=""#CR166"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR166"">166</a>]. Despite the multitudes of cytokines in single reports, a smaller number have been implicated in meta-analyses, including IL6, IL12, IL18, IL1RA, CCL2/MCP1, TNF, CRP, IFNG, and sTNF2 in both dementia and MDD; TGFB, IL1B, IL2, IL8, MCP3, IP10/CXCL10, and sTNF1 in dementia; and IL3, IL10, IL13, and sIL2 in MDD [<a href=""#CR149"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR149"">149</a>, <a href=""#CR151"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR151"">151</a>, <a href=""#CR155"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR155"">155</a>, <a href=""#CR156"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR156"">156</a>, <a href=""#CR158"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR158"">158</a>, <a href=""#CR162"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR162"">162</a>, <a href=""#CR163"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR163"">163</a>, <a href=""#CR167"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR167"">167</a>]. Of particular interest to depression in dementia, IL1B, IL4, IL6, IL8, IL17A, TNF, IFNG, CRP, and MIP1 have been implicated in treatment resistant depression [<a href=""#CR144"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR144"">144</a>, <a href=""#CR148"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR148"">148</a>, <a href=""#CR156"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR156"">156</a>, <a href=""#CR164"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR164"">164</a>].

If considering treatment resistance and consistent evidence via meta-analysis of cytokine change in MDD and dementia, only IL6, TNF, and CRP are implicated, though this may reflect the relative popularity of these molecules for study.</p>"
"<p id=""Par24"">While noting overlap between MDD and dementia is helpful for understanding depression in dementia, to our knowledge, there has only been two studies of cytokine changes in depression in dementia [<a href=""#CR168"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR168"">168</a>, <a href=""#CR169"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR169"">169</a>]. In the first study of 31 people with AD and depression, 24 with AD and no depression, and 37 age-matched controls, peripheral IL6 and TNF were elevated in those with AD and depression compared to both those with AD and no depression and controls [<a href=""#CR164"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR164"">164</a>]. IL1B was higher in those with AD regardless of depression status. In the second study, 222 subjects were followed for 6 months, and peripheral IL6, TNF, and CRP were measured. Participants were dichotomized into high and low cytokine groups, and a non-zero score for depression on the NPI represented depression being present. Those with high levels of TNF but not IL6 or CRP were associated with a greater presence of depression [<a href=""#CR168"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR168"">168</a>, <a href=""#CR169"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR169"">169</a>]. These studies did not examine any other immune markers, which will be an important source of investigation in the future.</p>"
"<p id=""Par25"">The associations between depression and dementia with inflammation are well-studied, but the underlying mechanism is less clear, which has likely impacted successful immunomodulatory treatments for either disorder. For dementia, many treatments against cytokines and microglia have been tried, but none have been successful in humans [<a href=""#CR170"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR170"">170</a>]. While there have been some meta-analyses that have suggested promise for immunomodulators in depression [<a href=""#CR171"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR171"">171</a>, <a href=""#CR172"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR172"">172</a>], these meta-analyses have included very heterogeneous studies with few participants, have signs of frequent bias, and “obvious and non-obvious errors” [<a href=""#CR173"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR173"">173</a>]. A deeper understanding of the interaction between these peripheral cytokines and underlying mechanisms are essential for understanding dementia, depression, and ultimately depression in dementia.</p>"
"<p id=""Par26"">For dementia, microglia have been implicated as the likely final actors of the inflammatory response and are correlated with cognitive decline [<a href=""#CR174"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR174"">174</a>–<a href=""#CR176"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR176"">176</a>]. In general, this has led many researchers to conclude that interactions between the innate immune system and the central nervous system (CNS) are the most important drivers of neurodegeneration in dementia [<a href=""#CR175"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR175"">175</a>–<a href=""#CR177"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR177"">177</a>], but recent evidence has challenged this position (discussed below). In terms of microglia and neurodegeneration, a multifaceted role has been suggested, with microglia likely preventing neurodegeneration early in the disease, most notably through phagocytosis of putative pathogenic molecules like Aβ [<a href=""#CR174"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR174"">174</a>–<a href=""#CR177"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR177"">177</a>]. However, microglia have also been implicated in phagocytosis of synapses through the complement cascade, creation of reactive oxygen species, and secreting cytokines which further hamper proper neuronal function and neurotrophic balance [<a href=""#CR176"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR176"">176</a>–<a href=""#CR179"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR179"">179</a>]. As loss of synaptic function is the best correlate of cognitive decline [<a href=""#CR180"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR180"">180</a>], these actions of microglia clearly place them at the center of neurodegeneration, at least as it relates to cognition. It should be noted, however, that simply labeling microglial activation as pro- or anti-inflammatory, M1-like or M2-like, and activated or quiescent is overly reductive [<a href=""#CR175"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR175"">175</a>, <a href=""#CR177"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR177"">177</a>, <a href=""#CR179"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR179"">179</a>, <a href=""#CR181"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR181"">181</a>] and may have partially led to the overly simplistic immunomodulator strategies that have already failed to show clinical promise. In fact, the presence of particularly dysfunctional and senescent microglia may be better tied to neurodegeneration than activated or hypertrophic microglia, as dystrophic microglia often precede overt tau pathology [<a href=""#CR177"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR177"">177</a>, <a href=""#CR179"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR179"">179</a>, <a href=""#CR182"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR182"">182</a>, <a href=""#CR183"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR183"">183</a>].</p>"
"<p id=""Par27"">While a clear role for microglia in neurodegeneration has been described, a mechanism for innate CNS immunity in depression is less clear. Leading hypotheses for depression center around network disruption of certain cortico-limbic circuits influenced by numerous factors including monoaminergic transmission, glutamatergic imbalance, HPA axis dysfunction, epigenetic alterations and chromatin remodeling, and neurotrophic deficits resulting in dendritic atrophy and impaired neurogenesis [<a href=""#CR184"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR184"">184</a>]. Psychosocial stress is tied to the molecular changes associated with many of these hypotheses, and the link between stress and these mechanisms does not necessarily require microglia. However, increasing evidence is finding that psychosocial stress does impact microglial morphology and function, and emerging evidence suggests microglia could be important mediators of reduced synaptic signaling and neurogenesis associated with depression [<a href=""#CR184"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR184"">184</a>]. Mostly using PET-ligands for Translocator Protein (TSPO) that tracks monocyte-lineage cells, researchers have shown that there is increased signal for those with depression in specific limbic areas, including the anterior cingulate cortex, hippocampus, insula, prefrontal cortex, and temporal cortex [<a href=""#CR185"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR185"">185</a>]. Though TSPO does label some sparse astrocytes and recruited monocytes, authors suggest it is likely that this increase in signal represents more microglia in depression. While PET studies tend to report similar findings, post-mortem studies have less agreement, with only about half finding changes in microglial number but a higher percentage finding a difference in microglial morphology towards the activated, ameboid-like shape [<a href=""#CR186"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR186"">186</a>].</p>"
"<p id=""Par28"">However, unlike neurodegenerative disorders such as AD, the GWAS for depression implicate genes more closely tied to synaptic function than innate immunity [<a href=""#CR187"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR187"">187</a>], and as of yet, there are no clear activating factors for these immune changes as compared to the pathological aggregates in neurodegenerative disorders, though the immune activators ATP and HMGB1 have been hypothesized to be increased in the brain under stressful conditions [<a href=""#CR188"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR188"">188</a>]. Despite this lack of activating factor, the hypothesis that stress can cause ‘sterile inflammation’ in depression is an important mechanism linking immune changes and the disease [<a href=""#CR63"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR63"">63</a>]. It has been shown in repeatedly stressed mice [<a href=""#CR189"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR189"">189</a>] and humans under chronic, high stress conditions that there is an increase in immature, pro-inflammatory monocytes [<a href=""#CR189"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR189"">189</a>, <a href=""#CR190"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR190"">190</a>] Mechanistically, this increase leads to facilitated trafficking of these cells into the perivascular space and parenchyma through the endothelium, further stimulation of microglial inflammation, and ultimately anxiety-like behaviors in mice [<a href=""#CR188"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR188"">188</a>, <a href=""#CR191"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR191"">191</a>]. However, whether this mechanism correlates with depression is less clear. Continuing to determine how these central immune actors influence depressive symptoms will also be key to determining if neuroinflammation underlies the molecular mechanisms of depression in dementia.</p>"
"<p id=""Par29"">Initially, researchers considered that microglia reacted primarily to danger-associated or pathogen-associated molecular patterns, which were hypothesized to be the main pathological molecules associated with dementia and were little influenced by the adaptive immune system. However, mounting evidence indicates that peripheral immune cells and signals can cross into the CNS and influence microglial activity in dementia. For one, T-cells have been found to infiltrate the CNS in AD and AD-mouse models [<a href=""#CR192"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR192"">192</a>–<a href=""#CR197"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR197"">197</a>]. While initially this was considered a rare event of unknown significance, pre-clinical studies have clearly shown that these T-cells promote microglia-mediated and direct T-cell-mediated synaptic loss [<a href=""#CR192"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR192"">192</a>], and correlations between degeneration and T-cell infiltration have been seen [<a href=""#CR182"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR182"">182</a>]. These T-cell mediated changes may be facilitated by interferon-gamma signaling [<a href=""#CR192"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR192"">192</a>], and there is good evidence that both CD4 + and CD8 + T-cells move towards a more differentiated state with fewer T-reg and more T-effector cells in AD versus healthy controls [<a href=""#CR192"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR192"">192</a>–<a href=""#CR194"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR194"">194</a>, <a href=""#CR198"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR198"">198</a>]. Some have also implicated B-cells in AD pathogenesis, noting increased activated B-cells in AD patients’ blood stream and parenchyma and demonstrating that B-cell depletion blocks AD-related change and cognitive deficits in pre-clinical models [<a href=""#CR199"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR199"">199</a>], though others have found a decrease in peripheral B-cells across dementia [<a href=""#CR198"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR198"">198</a>]. Even innate, non-microglia immune cells such as circulating neutrophils have been shown to be altered in AD, as in the IMABio3 cohort it was found that those with AD were more likely to have basal hyperactivation of neutrophils, higher reactive oxygen species (ROS) in stimulated and unstimulated neutrophils, higher levels of necrotic and apoptotic neutrophils, lower phagocytic function, and a higher proportion of senescent neutrophils [<a href=""#CR150"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR150"">150</a>]. Further, many of these abnormalities were more prominent in those with AD dementia than MCI, and ROS production and number of senescent cells were both correlated with PET-amyloid signaling and change in cognitive score using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) [<a href=""#CR150"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR150"">150</a>]. Others have similarly found increased populations of monocytes expressing IL1B [<a href=""#CR200"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR200"">200</a>]. Though it remains unclear if peripheral monocytes influence neurodegeneration, their activation could lead to an increase in pro-inflammatory cross-talk between the periphery and CNS [<a href=""#CR201"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR201"">201</a>]. Facilitating this cross-talk is increased blood–brain-barrier permeability in dementia, which serves as a means for peripheral inflammatory signaling molecules to influence microglia [<a href=""#CR202"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR202"">202</a>]. Altogether, these findings support that an extra-CNS immune landscape may have more influence on neurodegeneration than previously thought, and this could implicate both peripheral immune changes and adaptive immunity as being more than just epiphenomenal biomarkers.</p>"
"<p id=""Par30"">Complementing the peripheral immune cell changes in neurodegeneration, depression has also been associated with changes in peripheral immunity. For instance, broad characterization of neutrophils and lymphocytes suggest an increase in the neutrophil-to-leukocyte ratio in those with depression [<a href=""#CR203"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR203"">203</a>]. When comparing large categories of immune cells, there is disagreement about whether there are increases or decreases in peripheral T-cells and B-cells [<a href=""#CR204"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR204"">204</a>]. However, there is considerably more agreement that there is an increase in pro-inflammatory Th17 cells in depression [<a href=""#CR204"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR204"">204</a>, <a href=""#CR205"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR205"">205</a>]. Interestingly, when peripheral blood mononuclear cells were exposed to plasma from people with MDD and otherwise healthy controls, there was a pattern of reduced activated monocytes and B-cells as well as decreased effector T-cells in those with depression [<a href=""#CR164"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR164"">164</a>]. Still, less is clear about how these peripheral immune cells are functioning in depression, though it is noted that blocking IL17 or depleting B- and T-cells leads to less depression-like behavior in mice [<a href=""#CR204"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR204"">204</a>, <a href=""#CR205"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR205"">205</a>]. However, there is yet no studies comparing any of these cell populations in the periphery, CSF, or parenchyma of those with and without depression in dementia.</p>"
"<p id=""Par31"">Vascular Cognitive Impairment and Dementia (VCID) is a well-recognized entity that is best typified by either onset of cognitive deficits after a large cerebrovascular event like stroke or significant evidence of cerebrovascular disease in the form of large vessel infarcts, strategically placed single infarcts or microhemorrhages, or diffuse subcortical cerebrovascular disease, mostly observed in white matter [<a href=""#CR29"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR29"">29</a>, <a href=""#CR206"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR206"">206</a>, <a href=""#CR207"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR207"">207</a>]. The International Society for Vascular Behavioral and Cognitive Disorders further specify an expected pattern of symptoms: “decline is prominent in speed of information processing, complex attention, and/or frontal-executive functioning” [<a href=""#CR29"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR29"">29</a>, <a href=""#CR206"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR206"">206</a>, <a href=""#CR207"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR207"">207</a>]. Though a vascular etiology of dementia can be its own entity, it is well-recognized that vascular disease plays a prominent role in other dementias, and the diagnosis of ‘mixed dementia’ due to multiple etiologies, usually involving vascular, is quite common [<a href=""#CR202"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR202"">202</a>, <a href=""#CR208"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR208"">208</a>, <a href=""#CR209"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR209"">209</a>]. Within AD, for instance, there are frequent associations with intra- and extra-cranial atherosclerosis, vascular rarefaction, amyloid deposition in vessel walls – which can reach 85–95% of AD cases, increased blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability, and reduced cerebral blood flow with evidence of Aβ-mediated vasoconstriction [<a href=""#CR208"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR208"">208</a>]. It is likely that mixed etiologies are more common than single etiologies for dementia, and &gt; 60% of all dementia cases have vascular pathology, with that number being closer to 80% for AD [<a href=""#CR210"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR210"">210</a>].</p>"
"<p id=""Par32"">Similarly, many have hypothesized that a distinct etiology of LLD is driven by vascular dysfunction, named “Vascular Depression” [<a href=""#CR211"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR211"">211</a>–<a href=""#CR213"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR213"">213</a>]. As evidence of this association, researchers point to the significant co-morbidity between late-life vascular risk factors and diseases (hypertension, coronary artery disease, peripheral arterial disease, heart failure, increased blood pressure variability) with late-onset depression [<a href=""#CR211"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR211"">211</a>, <a href=""#CR213"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR213"">213</a>–<a href=""#CR215"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR215"">215</a>], high rates of depression after significant cerebrovascular events like cerebral infarct and subcortical lacunar infarcts [<a href=""#CR215"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR215"">215</a>], increased extra-cranial vascular changes in arterial stiffness and endothelial dysfunction [<a href=""#CR213"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR213"">213</a>, <a href=""#CR216"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR216"">216</a>], and depression being more likely in VCID than AD as well as LLD being more likely to develop VCID than AD [<a href=""#CR217"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR217"">217</a>]. Though still controversial, many researchers suggest that those with vascular depression are more likely to exhibit later onset, absence of family history, less awareness of mood symptoms, low energy and self-initiation, and cognitive deficits, especially in processing speed and executive function [<a href=""#CR211"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR211"">211</a>, <a href=""#CR213"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR213"">213</a>, <a href=""#CR214"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR214"">214</a>, <a href=""#CR218"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR218"">218</a>]. In addition, they suggested these patients were less likely to respond to antidepressants [<a href=""#CR218"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR218"">218</a>], another notable similarity to depression in dementia.</p>"
"<p id=""Par33"">However, arguably the most important association between LLD and vascular dysfunction came from the frequent finding of increased white matter hyperintensities (WMH) on T2 MRI in periventricular and subcortical white matter as well as occasionally in subcortical grey matter [<a href=""#CR219"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR219"">219</a>–<a href=""#CR221"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR221"">221</a>]. Pathologically, these WMH are often noted to contain partial loss of myelin and axons with more extensive astrogliosis, including microgliosis, and are often in proximity to small vessel changes [<a href=""#CR222"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR222"">222</a>]. While single punctate and periventricular WMH may have slightly different etiologies, there is a better association between vascular pathology and confluent WMH [<a href=""#CR222"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR222"">222</a>]. Often, WMH and signs of damage to long myelinated fibers were tied to frontal cortical regions [<a href=""#CR211"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR211"">211</a>, <a href=""#CR213"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR213"">213</a>, <a href=""#CR223"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR223"">223</a>] and coupled with the dysexecutive phenotype identified in many with Vascular Depression. A hypothesis was formed that it was the disconnection in corticolimbic and corticostriatal signaling due to loss of these tracts that defined Vascular Depression [<a href=""#CR211"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR211"">211</a>, <a href=""#CR213"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR213"">213</a>, <a href=""#CR214"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR214"">214</a>]. In addition, WMH were associated with poorer treatment response [<a href=""#CR218"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR218"">218</a>].</p>"
"<p id=""Par34"">With all this evidence combined, it was nearly certain that significant vascular pathology would be intimately tied to LLD. However, when histopathological examinations were performed, it was very common that there was no clear association between many vascular hallmarks and LLD [<a href=""#CR99"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR99"">99</a>, <a href=""#CR224"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR224"">224</a>]. While there are many reasons for this lack of association – including low sample numbers in some studies, semi-quantitative measures of pathology as either ‘present’ or ‘absent’, inability to analyze in a region- or fiber tract-specific manner – this highlights the complexity of interpreting WMH and their relation to LLD. It is possible that WMH are not simply a measure of microinfarcts but also are correlated with more subtle changes in the vasculature. For instance, WMH have also been tied to non-infarction decreases in cerebral blood flow [<a href=""#CR225"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR225"">225</a>, <a href=""#CR226"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR226"">226</a>] and increased BBB permeability [<a href=""#CR155"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR155"">155</a>, <a href=""#CR226"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR226"">226</a>, <a href=""#CR227"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR227"">227</a>]. These more subtle vascular changes, which are not readily identifiable in most pathological workups, may also be more easily driven by peripheral inflammation as well, connecting the inflammatory hypothesis to the vascular hypothesis [<a href=""#CR213"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR213"">213</a>].</p>"
"<p id=""Par35"">One of the most intriguing connections between depression, vascular dysfunction, and inflammation has been in the form of BBB disruption. While mechanistically most work has been pre-clinical, it has been shown that various forms of psychosocial stress in mice increase BBB permeability through reduction of tight-junction protein claudin-5 [<a href=""#CR228"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR228"">228</a>–<a href=""#CR230"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR230"">230</a>]. Further, this increase in BBB was mediated by TNF and downstream NFKB as well as possibly increased GSK3B signaling, resulting in greater influx of IL6 into the parenchyma [<a href=""#CR228"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR228"">228</a>–<a href=""#CR230"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR230"">230</a>]. Importantly, claudin-5 reduction was detected in two independent post-mortem cohorts of MDD patients’ nucleus accumbens [<a href=""#CR230"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR230"">230</a>] as well as epigenetic changes in the claudin-5 promotor of those with MDD [<a href=""#CR229"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR229"">229</a>]. In the first study of transcriptomic changes in depression in AD (under review), we similarly found changes in NFKB signaling and network information flow differences in both GSK3B and TGFB, a signaling cascade that is often in opposition to NFKB. While this work was performed in the anterior cingulate cortex instead of nucleus accumbens, it would be an interesting hypothesis that those with depression in dementia are more prone to BBB dysfunction from increased inflammation, leading to changes in microglia and ultimately corticolimbic and corticostriatal circuitry. Still, this hypothesis is in its infancy, and further research is certainly needed to entertain it, as it is unlikely that this is the only mechanism of depression in dementia.</p>"
"<p id=""Par36"">Sleep disturbances are also common in MDD and dementia, and there is evidence that poor quality or disordered sleep can increase risk of both disorders [<a href=""#CR231"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR231"">231</a>–<a href=""#CR233"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR233"">233</a>], especially when also considering the role of sleep apnea [<a href=""#CR234"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR234"">234</a>]. Mechanistically, sleep abnormalities are associated with multiple molecular and cellular mechanisms that are dysfunctional in depression in dementia, including associations between poor sleep and more white matter hyperintensities [<a href=""#CR235"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR235"">235</a>] and changes in neuroinflammation tied to circadian disruption [<a href=""#CR231"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR231"">231</a>, <a href=""#CR236"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR236"">236</a>]. In addition, similar molecular aberrations are found in both MDD and dementias, including increase in oxidative stress, changes in autophagy, and impaired glymphatic function [<a href=""#CR231"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR231"">231</a>, <a href=""#CR236"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR236"">236</a>]. However to our knowledge, there have not been studies demonstrating sleep disruption as mediating affective symptoms in dementia, though depressive symptoms do seem to mediate cognitive function in MCI partially via sleep disturbance [<a href=""#CR237"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR237"">237</a>]. In the 2014 review of symptom clustering studies utilizing the NPI, sleep problems clustered with affective symptoms in 5 studies, psychosis in 7 studies, hyperactivity in 2 studies, euphoria in 1 study, and on its own or in other clusters in 9 studies [<a href=""#CR54"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR54"">54</a>], suggesting that depression and sleep problems may not cluster together the majority of the time. Still, it is likely that sleep disruption at least exacerbates depression in dementia, and the direct link between these entities deserves greater consideration.</p>"
"<p id=""Par37"">Depression in dementia remains understudied, but many other etiological hypotheses exist. However, these additional hypotheses have either poor evidence of dysfunction in both LLD and dementia, conflicting data, or are in the very earliest stage of investigation. Some of these hypotheses include mechanisms involving glucocorticoid signaling [<a href=""#CR238"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR238"">238</a>], monoamine dysregulation [<a href=""#CR239"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR239"">239</a>, <a href=""#CR240"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR240"">240</a>], insulin deficiency [<a href=""#CR241"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR241"">241</a>] frailty/senescence [<a href=""#CR242"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR242"">242</a>], altered gut microbiota [<a href=""#CR243"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR243"">243</a>], cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathways [<a href=""#CR244"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR244"">244</a>], changes in klotho [<a href=""#CR245"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR245"">245</a>], astrocyte dysfunction [<a href=""#CR246"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR246"">246</a>], zinc dysregulation [<a href=""#CR247"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR247"">247</a>], GABAergic signaling [<a href=""#CR248"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR248"">248</a>], and TGFB signaling [<a href=""#CR60"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR60"">60</a>]. Further studies to test some of these hypotheses are necessary.</p>"

"<p id=""Par39"">Though the inflammation and vascular hypotheses of depression in dementia show promise, direct evidence for these etiologies remains lacking. In addition, it remains unclear how the putative pathogenic aggregates that drive most neurodegenerative dementias may also cause depression in dementia. This contrasts with the numerous studies investigating the molecular mechanisms behind cognitive deficits in dementia, which is exemplified by the increasing number of -omics studies on the subject [<a href=""#CR249"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR249"">249</a>–<a href=""#CR256"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR256"">256</a>]. These studies suggested that other molecular mechanisms interact with the standard pathological proteins implicated in dementia, and similar studies would be welcome for NPS, including depression.</p>"
"<p id=""Par40"">In our experience, there are some important but potentially non-obvious barriers to determining the molecular mechanisms of depression in dementia. The first barrier is the lack of rigorous psychiatric assessments associated with large cohort studies, many of which have been instrumental in elucidating the molecular mechanisms of dementias on the whole-brain imaging, proteomic, transcriptomic, metabolomic, and epigenetic levels. For example, National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Centers (NACC) created the Uniform Data Set on all their participants from the 37 Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers in the United States [<a href=""#CR257"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR257"">257</a>]. While this is an important wealth of information for researchers, the extent of data collection on psychiatric symptoms involves administering the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire (NPI-Q) and Geriatric Depression Scale-short form (GDS) at time of diagnosis and on follow-up as able. The NPI-Q details 12 NPS, including depression/dysphoria, anxiety, and apathy, and scores each as 0–3 based on severity. This is determined by the informant, and unlike the NPI, there is no score given for the more objective measurement of frequency. Therefore, the scores on the NPI-Q may often reflect the severity of distress of the informant as opposed to the actual severity or frequency of symptoms. This has been true in our own experience in a clinical setting, as it has not been uncommon to see some informants mark all ‘0’ for each NPS because of their own perception or desire that there is no dementing illness, while some informants that are overly burdened will indiscriminately mark ‘3’ for all symptoms because they are so overwhelmed. In addition, with the NPI-Q often being missing near the time of death in NACC, the post-mortem analyses that come afterwards may be a decade removed from the only psychiatric assessment performed.</p>"
"<p id=""Par41"">The GDS is a list of 15 yes-or-no questions related to depression as a syndrome, but it has multiple questions that are more fitting for apathy and at least one question related to attention and cognition. In addition to increasing ambiguity between dysphoria, apathy and cognition, the yes/no format obscures the frequency and severity of depression symptoms, making longitudinal measures hard to interpret, as the severity of dysphoria could increase but result in the same or even lower score if other symptoms are no longer present.</p>"
"<p id=""Par42"">Still, many imaging, interventional, and post-mortem studies have no measures of NPS at all, and we would advocate that these assessments need to be performed more frequently to improve research into NPS, like depression. Further, given the difficulties that clinicians have in determining differences between depression, anhedonia, and apathy, it may be advantageous to parse out these symptoms a little more finely at time of diagnosis – perhaps more in line with the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) approach of dimensional as opposed to syndromic constructs. Similarly, there has been a lot of consideration of how clinical features differ in early and LLD, but it is less clear how clinical features differ between those with depression that presents before and after dementia diagnosis. Especially in terms of treatment response, these distinctions based on the timing of onset could be helpful clinically. We believe that making these changes could lead to a robust new understanding in the molecular mechanisms behind NPS like depression, ultimately leading to treatments that will help patients and their families.</p>"

"<p id=""P1"">This study describes the relationship of irritable mood (IRR) with affective disorders in youths with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).</p>"
"<p id=""P2"">Five hundred ADHD subjects were assessed with the childhood version of the Schedule for Affective Disorder &amp; Schizophrenia. Subjects were in a genetic ADHD protocol and limited to those of Caucasian/European descent.</p>"
"<p id=""P3"">The most prevalent concurrent diagnoses were oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) (43.6%), minor depression/dysthymic disorder (MDDD) (18.8%), and generalized anxiety (13.2%)/overanxious disorder (12.4%). IRR subjects (21.0%) compared to the non-IRR (NIRR) group had higher rates of all affective disorders (76.2% vs. 9.6%) and ODD (83.8% vs. 32.9%) but lower rates of hyperactive ADHD (1.9% vs. 8.9%). Among those without comorbidities, 98.3% were NIRR. Logistic regression found IRR mood significantly associated with major depressive disorder (odds ratio [OR]: 33.4), MDDD (OR: 11.2), ODD (OR: 11.6), and combined ADHD (OR: 1.7) but not with anxiety disorders. Among symptoms, it associated IRR mood with a pattern of dysthymic and ODD symptoms but with fewer separation anxiety symptoms. Diagnostic and symptomatic parameters were unaffected by demographic variables.</p>"
"<p id=""P4"">Potential confounders influencing these results include patient recruitment from only one clinical service; a cohort specific sample effect because some presumed affective disorders and non-Caucasians were excluded; and the young mean age (10.2 years) limiting comorbid patterns.</p>"
"<p id=""P5"">The prominence of an MDDD pattern suggests this IRR group is appropriate in the DSM V's proposed chronic depressive disorder, possibly with or without temper dysregulation. A new diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder may be unwarranted.</p>"
"<p><strong>Keywords:</strong> irritability, ADHD, dysthymia, minor depression, bipolar</p>"
"<p id=""P6"">Irritable mood (IRR) has taken center stage in the diagnosis of childhood-onset bipolar disorder. Numerous reports suggest that, in contrast to the “classical” distinct and time-limited periods of irritability and dysphoria, chronic, nonepisodic irritability is characteristic of pediatric bipolar disorder (<a href=""#R20"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R20"">Kowatch et al., 2005</a>). This conceptualization of pediatric bipolarity emerged from Biederman's work, which first identified the association of nonepisodic irritability with bipolar symptoms in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (<a href=""#R34"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R34"">Wozniak et al., 1995</a>). As this theme entered the clinical practice of child psychiatry, reports of pediatric bipolarity greatly increased (<a href=""#R10"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R10"">Blader and Carlson, 2007</a>; <a href=""#R27"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R27"">Moreno et al., 2007</a>), although some questioned this interpretation of the clinical data (<a href=""#R6"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R6"">Biederman et al., 1998a</a>; <a href=""#R11"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R11"">Brotman et al., 2006</a>; <a href=""#R12"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R12"">Carlson, 1998</a>; <a href=""#R25"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R25"">McClellan, 2005</a>). This diagnostic issue was further complicated by the fact that irritability is associated not only with bipolar disorder but also with oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and dysthymic disorder (DD) in youths (<a href=""#R26"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R26"">Mick et al., 2005</a>). The diagnostic meaning of “rage attacks” or anger episodes in youths also remains unsettled (<a href=""#R13"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R13"">Carlson, 2007</a>). Both clinical and physiological data regarding IRR are sparse (<a href=""#R22"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R22"">Leibenluft et al., 2003a</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P7"">Liebenluft has suggested interpreting this IRR phenotype as a manifestation of severe mood dysregulation (SMD) (<a href=""#R11"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R11"">Brotman et al., 2006</a>; <a href=""#R23"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R23"">Leibenluft et al., 2003b</a>, <a href=""#R24"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R24"">2006</a>; <a href=""#R30"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R30"">Stringaris et al., 2009</a>). Although ongoing research is attempting to clarify the diagnostic parameters of early-onset bipolarity and severe mood disturbances, it is unclear how the symptom of irritability segregates within ADHD samples, how it influences the clinical presentation of ADHD, and whether there is a continuum between more severe rage and less intense IRR. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders V (DSM V) working committee is addressing this issue and has proposed a diagnostic category within the mood disorder section labeled disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD), based predominately on Liebenluft's work with SMD. This new classification attempts to more clearly differentiate the phenotype of SMD for both treatment and research purposes. The aim of this study was to identify the demographic and clinical characteristics of IRR in youths with ADHD and its relationship with comorbid disorders. Classification issues related to the IRR child are discussed.</p>"
"<p id=""P8"">This study used a cross-sectional design incorporating 500 parent-child triads with one or more ADHD probands. Subjects were recruited from local pediatric and behavioral health clinics for an ADHD genetic study. Patient recruitment was completed over a 55-month period and this sample represented consecutive admissions to the study. All subjects were Caucasian of European descent. Other ethnicities were excluded to maximize the power to detect genetic associations because haplotype frequencies can vary substantially across major world populations (<a href=""#R14"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R14"">Chang et al., 1996</a>). Approximately 10% of the sample (52/500) were sibling pairs or triads. The initial inclusion/exclusion criteria were verified by phone screenings: age range, 6 to 18 years; presence of ADHD symptoms; European descent; and availability and willingness of both biological parents to participate in a genetic study. Exclusionary criteria were premature birth (at &lt; 36 weeks) and major medical, neurological, or neuropsychiatric problems including pervasive developmental disorder, mental retardation, psychoses, bipolar disorder, and MDD with symptoms starting prior to ADHD or with ADHD symptoms that occurred primarily during depressed episodes. Children with documented IQ scores &lt; 75 were excluded as were children unable to comprehend or complete the Schedule of Affective Disorders &amp; Schizophrenia-Present State Version (KSADS-P IVR).</p>"
"<p id=""P9"">A child psychiatrist trained to reliability with the K-SADS-P IVR completed the diagnostic assessments. This K-SADS is keyed to DSM IVR criteria, but where there is overlap with research diagnostic criteria (RDC), RDC take precedence (<a href=""#R29"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R29"">Spitzer et al., 1978</a>). The K-SADS-P IVR records irritability as a symptom independent of depressed mood. Irritability/anger (subjective) was added as a third primary symptom of major depression to verify whether it was synonymous with depressed mood. KSADS defined irritability/anger as a subjective feeling of bad temper, short temper, crankiness, or annoyance within the context of a mood disorder. This change permitted diagnosing an “irritable affective disorder,” which is a depressive disorder in which irritability replaces depressed mood or pervasive anhedonia as the cardinal symptom. This approach implies that those with IRR affective disorders met standard diagnostic criteria but had IRR mood only, not depressed mood or pervasive anhedonia. The symptoms (being easily angered and easily annoyed) are within the domain of ODD. These are overt symptoms related to being easily bothered by or resentful of others. This is ODD-type irritability as described by Biederman's group (<a href=""#R26"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R26"">Mick et al.,2005</a>). All ADHD and concurrent comorbid diagnoses analyzed were active at the time of the evaluation; furthermore, subjects were not in treatment by the research team when assessed.</p>"
"<p id=""P10"">For this study, several diagnostic groupings were calculated: MDDD (minor depression [MD] or dysthymic disorder [DD]); any anxiety disorder (AnyAD); and any depressive disorder (AnyDD). Minor depression is an RDC category that includes the criteria of major depression plus 8 additional symptoms (<a href=""#T1"" class=""usa-link"">Table 1</a>). The four ADHD subtypes are labeled inattentive ADHD (ADDI), hyperactive ADHD (ADDH), combined ADHD (ADDC), and ADHD not otherwise specified (ADDN). A detailed list of the diagnoses available with the K-SADS-P IVR is available (<a href=""#R18"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R18"">Elia et al., 2008</a>). This protocol was approved by the institutional review boards of the participating institutions.</p>"

Descriptive statistics, including examination of sex differences in demographic variables and comorbidity rates, are presented using <em>t</em> tests and chi-square tests.

"<p id=""P12"">Demographic parameters and prevalence of IRR are shown in <a href=""#T2"" class=""usa-link"">Table 2</a>. The 500 subjects had a mean age of 10.2 (SD 3.2) years and were predominantly male (367/500; 73.4%). The girls were significantly older than the boys (10.8 vs. 10.0, F=7.4, df=1, p=0.007). Using an age cutoff of &lt;13 years for pubertal status, slightly more boys were prepubertal (81.2% vs. 71.4%) and more girls, adolescent (28.6% vs. 18.8%). This finding was compatible with the older age of the girls.</p>"
<p>Demographic characteristics of the ADHD sample.</p>
"<p>ADHD=attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; Adol=adolescent, ≥ 13 y; IRR=irritable; NIRR=nonirritable; ns=not significant; Prepub=prepubertal, &lt;13 y.</p>"
"<p id=""P13"">A total of 21.0% (105/500) of the sample had either subjective or overt IRR with nearly identical rates between the sexes (20.7% vs. 21.8%, M: F). Only 13 children had overt irritability, but only 3 had overt IRR without concurrent subjective irritability. Overt IRR is that defined within the bipolar section of the K-SADS. The mean IRR score based on the K-SADS was 3.1 vs. 1.9 (range 1 to 7) in those with and without IRR. The IRR sample was older than the NIRR group (10.8 vs. 10.0, F=4.26, df=1, p=0.039); again, the IRR girls were older than the IRR boys (12.0 vs. 10.3, F=6.38, df=1, p=0.01). The proportional rate of IRR did not significantly differ by sex or pubertal status. Adolescent girls had the highest rate (28.9%) and prepubertal boys, the lowest rate, of IRR (19.8%).</p>"
"<p id=""P14"">The overall comorbid pattern in this sample was similar to that in a previous analysis of the first 342 subjects recruited into this protocol (<a href=""#R18"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R18"">Elia et al., 2008</a>). The three most prevalent disorders were ODD (43.6%), minor depression/dysthymia (22.6%), and generalized anxiety disorder (13.2%)/overanxious disorder (12.4%). Overall, 23.6% had AnyDD and 29.0% had AnyAD.</p>"
"<p id=""P15"">The rates of all affective disorders were similar between the sexes. Simple phobic disorder (11.3% vs. 5.7%) and separation anxiety (12.0% vs. 4.1%) were significantly more common in girls. Girls had a significantly higher overall rate of AnyAD compared with boys (37.6% vs. 25.9%, respectively; <em>x</em><sup>2</sup>=5.9, df=1, p=0.02). Among disruptive behavior disorders, more girls met criteria for ADDI (<em>x</em><sup>2</sup>=3.6, p=0.057), but all other ADHD subtypes and ODD were equally prevalent across the sexes.</p>"
"<p id=""P16"">The symptom of irritability influenced the ADHD comorbid pattern. Those with IRR had a significantly higher number of co-occurring diagnoses inclusive of ADHD than those without IRR (3.1 vs. 1.8, respectively; F=154.83, df=1, p&lt;0.001). Only 2.9% (3/105) of subjects with IRR vs. 44.8% (177/395) of NIRR subjects had ADHD without concurrent comorbid diagnoses. A total of 98.3% (177/180) of ADHD subjects without comorbid disorders were not IRR.</p>"
"<p id=""P17"">Irritability substantially changed the affective disorder comorbid array. IRR subjects had significantly higher rates of all depressive disorders compared with their NIRR peers. A total of 54.3% of the IRR children but only 9.4% of the NIRR children had a currently active MD or DD; 0.3% (1/395) of the NIRR but 21.0% (22/105) of the IRR subjects had a major depressive disorder (MDD). Overall, 76.2% of IRR and 9.6% of NIRR subjects had any depressive disorder (AnyDD) (<a href=""#F1"" class=""usa-link"">Fig. 1</a>). The affective disorder frequency within both IRR subsets remained similar between the sexes. This finding could reflect the young mean age of the sample as the female predominance of affective illness first emerges in the early teen years (<a href=""#R4"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R4"">Angold et al., 1998</a>).</p>"

<p>Distribution of affective disorders: Irritable (IRR) (n=105) sample compared with nonirritable (NIRR) (n=395) sample of ADHD patients. MDD=major depressive disorder; IMDD=irritable MDD; MD=minor depression; IMD=irritable MD; DD=dysthymic disorder; IDD=irritable DD; Cyclo=cyclothymic disorder; MDDT= MDD + IMDD; MDDD=MD + IMD + DD + IDD; AnyDD=any depressive disorder. All frequency differences are significant (*p &lt;0.05; **p&lt;0.001).</p>
"<p id=""P18"">IRR affected the rates of anxiety disorders more subtly as the rate of having any anxiety disorder now was similar between the IRR/NIRR subsets (34.3% vs. 27.5%, respectively). The rate of anxiety disorders in those with IRR ranged from 1.0% to 16.2%. (A complete list of anxiety and behavioral comorbidities is available in <a href=""#SD1"" class=""usa-link"">Supplementary Tables 1</a> and <a href=""#SD2"" class=""usa-link"">2</a>.) Whereas the rates of separation anxiety (SA) and AnyAD were higher in girls than in boys, IRR shifted this pattern. NIRR girls had a significantly higher rate of SA (14.4% vs. 4.1%) while IRR girls had a significantly higher rate of AnyAD (51.7% vs. 27.6%) compared to their sex-matched peers (<a href=""#T3"" class=""usa-link"">Table 3</a>). IRR had no effect on anxiety disorders in boys.</p>"
<p>Anxiety and behavior disorder frequency by sex in IRR and NIRR ADHD Sample</p>
<p>ADHD=attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; AnyAD=any anxiety disorder; IRR=irritable mood; NIRR=nonirritable; ns=nonsignificant; ODD=oppositional defiant disorder; SA=separation anxiety.</p>
"<p id=""P19"">Irritability greatly increased the overall rate of ODD. A total of 83.8% of the IRR but only 32.9% of the NIRR patients met criteria for ODD (<em>x</em><sup>2</sup>=85.3, df=1, p&lt;0.001). ODD prevalence was similar in either sex regardless of IRR status. ODD was somewhat more dominant in the preadolescent versus the adolescent IRR subset (89.6% vs. 67.9%, <em>x<sup>2</sup></em>=5.65, p=0.017). The conduct disorder rate (0.6%) was too low to analyze. <a href=""#T3"" class=""usa-link"">Table 3</a> lists these group differences.</p>"
"<p id=""P20"">In the full sample, the rates of all ADHD subtypes were similar between the boys and the girls. IRR status changed this pattern. The frequency of ADDI was similar in the IRR/NIRR cohorts; there was a trend for higher rates of ADDC (68.6% vs. 58.5%; <em>x</em><sup>2</sup>=3.13, df=1, p=0.077) in the IRR group; but now there was a significantly <em>lower</em> rate of hyperactive ADHD (ADDH) in the IRR patients (1.9% vs. 8.9%, respectively; p=0.012, FE) regardless of sex. However, there were sex differences among the ADHD subtypes according to their IRR status. ADDI was most characteristic of IRR girls (<em>x</em><sup>2</sup>=4.45, df=1, p=0.035). <em>So,</em> within the IRR subjects themselves, 51.7% (15/29) of girls and 21.1% (16/76) of boys had ADDI (<em>x</em><sup>2</sup>=8.1, df=1, p=0.004). Although the proportional frequency of ADDC did not differ within the IRR/NIRR groups by sex, within the IRR sample alone (n=105), boys had a significantly higher rate of ADDC than girls (76.3% [58/76] vs. 48.3% [14/29]; x<sup>2</sup>=6.4, df=1, p=0.011). To summarize these findings within the IRR dichotomy, IRR girls had the highest rate (51.7%) of ADDI and IRR boys, the lowest rate (21.1%); NIRR boys had the highest rate (10.0%) of ADDH whereas IRR girls had the lowest rate (0.0%); and IRR boys had the highest rate (76.3%) of ADDC while IRR girls had the lowest rate (48.3%). The symptom of IRR appeared to impinge more on the girls’ inattention symptomatology and decreased their hyperactive symptoms, while it increased combined symptomatology in boys. (For further delineation of these ADHD rates, see <a href=""#SD3"" class=""usa-link"">Supplementary Table 3</a>.)</p>"
"<p id=""P21"">The influence of IRR on symptomatic characteristics was examined within those diagnoses that showed differences between IRR and NIRR cases (i.e., affective, SA, ODD, and ADHD). Simple phobias were not addressed because of the individual specificity of this disorder. Within the affective symptoms, IRR subjects had significantly higher rates of depressed mood (<em>x<sup>2</sup></em>=37.8, df=1, p&lt;0.001), fatigue (<em>x<sup>2</sup></em>=10.0, df=1, p=0.002), insomnia (<em>x<sup>2</sup></em>=5.68, df=1, p=0.017), self-pity (<em>x<sup>2</sup></em>=4.82, df=1, p=0.028), hopelessness (<em>x<sup>2</sup></em>=5.78, df=1, p=0.016), and negative self-image (<em>x<sup>2</sup></em>=25.8, df=1, p&lt;0.001). The separation anxiety symptoms of fears sleeping alone (<em>x<sup>2</sup></em>=7.60, df=1, p=0.009) and nightmares (<em>x<sup>2</sup></em>=3.88, df=1, p=0.049) were significantly <em>less</em> common in the IRR sample. All ODD symptoms were more prevalent in the IRR sample. ADHD symptoms of carelessness (<em>x<sup>2</sup></em>=4.57, df=1, p=0.032), difficulty listening (<em>x<sup>2</sup></em>=6.05, df=1, p=0.014), and avoids tasks (<em>x<sup>2</sup></em>=6.69, df=1, p=0.014) were more frequent in the IRR group.</p>"
"<p id=""P22"">To identify the most prominent predictors of IRR, the diagnoses and symptoms that on univariate analysis showed a difference between IRR and NIRR subjects were placed into a logistic regression. The first analysis looked at diagnostic and demographic variables as predictors of IRR. A second regression looked at specific symptoms and demographic variables as predictors of IRR.</p>"
"<p id=""P23"">The logistic regression controlling for age and gender found that IRR was associated with MDD (OR: 33.4; p&lt;0.001, CI=4.1-271.7), MDDD (OR: 11.2; p&lt;0.001; CI=6.7-18.7), and ODD (OR: 11.6; p&lt;0.001, CI=6.6-20.6) but not with AnyAD. IRR youths were more likely to have ADDC (OR: 1.7; p=0.02,CI 1.1-2.8) and not ADDI (OR: 0.77; p=0.29, CI=0.5-1.3). Irritability was related to higher rates of three ADHD symptoms, six affective symptoms, and eight ODD symptoms. In contrast, IRR was related to lower rates of one SA symptom (fears sleeping alone) with a trend for a second symptom (nightmares). Demographic variables had no effect on symptomatic or diagnostic parameters (<a href=""#T4"" class=""usa-link"">Table 4</a>).</p>"
"<p>Odds ratio of symptoms as a function of irritability, controlling for age and gender</p>"
"<p id=""P24"">The co-occurrence of depression and ODD with ADHD is not a new finding (<a href=""#R3"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R3"">Angold et al., 1999</a>; <a href=""#R7"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R7"">Biederman et al., 1998b</a>). DD is reported more frequently in patients with ADDC (<a href=""#R33"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R33"">Vance et al., 2005</a>). This data set, however, expands these previous reports because it shows the unique contribution of the symptom of IRR alone within ADHD. The question remains, where does this sample of IRR ADHD children fit within the current bipolar child phenotype presented in the literature. It seems clear that this sample is not related to the bipolar child described in the COBY (Course and Outcome of Bipolar Illness in Youth) study (<a href=""#R5"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R5"">Axelson et al., 2006</a>; <a href=""#R9"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R9"">Birmaher et al., 2006</a>), because bipolar children were excluded from this sample. Rather, there are more similarities to the child with severe mood dysregulation (SMD) described by Liebenluft (<a href=""#R11"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R11"">Brotman et al., 2006</a>; <a href=""#R23"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R23"">Leibenluft et al., 2003b</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P25"">Evidence-based data supporting the predictive validity of SMD and chronic, nonepisodic irritability are based on two epidemiological samples, the Great Smoky Mountain Study (<a href=""#R11"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R11"">Brotman et al., 2006</a>) and the community-based New York Longitudinal Study (<a href=""#R24"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R24"">Liebenluft et al., 2006</a>; <a href=""#R30"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R30"">Stringaris et al., 2009</a>). These studies show that SMD and chronic irritability more likely predict a nonbipolar, depressive disorder outcome. Nonetheless, these studies only provide a proxy validation because they are retrospective analyses not originally designed to look at SMD. The irritable construct analyzed in these studies varied between cohorts and was collated from previously rated symptomatic scores including several symptom overlaps with affective disorders, ADHD, and ODD (<a href=""#R11"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R11"">Brotman et al., 2006</a>; <a href=""#R24"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R24"">Liebenluft et al., 2006</a>; <a href=""#R30"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R30"">Stringaris et al., 2009</a>). These validating studies must also be viewed together with a more recent follow-up of the Great Smoky Mountain Study cohort (<a href=""#R16"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R16"">Copeland et al., 2009</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P26"">This later report controlling for comorbidities analyzed the homotypic and heterotypic predictions of baseline child psychiatric diagnoses into young adulthood. The most consistent finding was that either child or adolescent ODD predicted later depressive disorder. Child overanxious disorder (OAD) also exhibited a heterotypic prediction with depressive disorders but mostly in males. Early onset anxiety disorder predicting adult affective disorder was similarly noted in the New York cohort (<a href=""#R28"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R28"">Pine et al., 1998</a>). It is of interest that four of seven OAD symptoms are minor depression criteria (<a href=""#T1"" class=""usa-link"">Table 1</a>). Because the lifetime rates of anxiety disorders (58.2%) and ODD (84.9%) are high in those with SMD (<a href=""#R21"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R21"">Leibenluft, 2011</a>), these data suggest that SMD's later prediction of a mood disorder is probably driven by the high comorbid rates of these two disorders and is not unique to the SMD phenotype. The heterotypic continuity of the SMD child suggests that SMD is a vulnerability phenotype for affective disorders. The fact that the SMD phenotype has a unique diagnostic outcome and specific biological parameters compared to the bipolar child supports its differentiation from the bipolar youth (<a href=""#R21"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R21"">Leibenluft, 2011</a>). Nonetheless, because affective and ODD comorbidities were allowed in the SMD category, it is difficult to know to which diagnostic domain any biological perturbation belongs. Biological deviations are not necessarily diagnosis specific, particularly if there is diagnostic overlap (<a href=""#R32"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R32"">van Praag, 1997</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P27"">This analysis highlights the significance of IRR alone to define a phenotype similar to the SMD child with high rates of ODD and comorbid anxiety disorder. The explanation for the lower rate of anxiety disorders in this cohort compared to those reported in SMD may be that this ADHD sample assessed concurrent rather than lifetime rates. The high rate of concurrent affective disorders (76.2%) puts a somewhat different clinical perspective on these children, because most of the previous studies also reported lifetime prevalence rather than concurrent comorbid depression. These data suggest that IRR mood in the ADHD population defines a unique concurrent pattern of an irritable affective disorder cooccurring with ODD. The affective symptoms are most consistent with either a minor depressive disorder or dysthymia. Although those with MDD were excluded from this study at the initial screening, pure IRR depression (without depressed mood or pervasive anhedonia) was previously shown highly associated with MDDD and not MDD, in an enriched depressive sample of more than 400 adolescents (<a href=""#R1"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R1"">Ambrosini et al., 1997</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P28"">The affective symptoms in this irritable sample are consistent with DSM V criteria for chronic depressive disorder (CDD) because they share the following symptoms: insomnia, fatigue, low self-esteem/negative image, and hopelessness. CDD also retains the qualifier that in children and adolescents, “mood can be irritable.” The fact that noncomorbid ADHD is essentially devoid of IRR places this clinical constellation most clearly in the affective domain.</p>"
"<p id=""P29"">The degree of IRR identified in this sample may not appear as severe as those labeled with SMD or the DSM V proposed DMDD because the majority had mild to moderate irritability based on the K-SADS. But even this degree of IRR had major effects on concurrent comorbidity. Within this sample, 76.2% of the IRR group had an affective disorder and 83.8% had ODD. Among the remaining 25 IRR subjects without a depressive disorder, 18 (17.1%) represented the IRR ADHD/ODD child; 4 (3.8%) represented IRR anxiety disorder children; and 3 (2.9%) had only ADHD. Also, the validating studies of SMD were epidemiological cohorts that would have a less intense symptomatic pattern than this current clinical sample.</p>"
"<p id=""P30"">Because affective symptomatology in these IRR MDDD children is subtle (more subjective than overt) compared to ODD symptoms and IRR itself, clinicians may overlook this affective pattern. In fact, in none of the validating papers on SMD were depressive symptom prevalences reported. Proposed DMDD criteria (<a href=""#R2"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R2"">American Psychiatric Association, 2011</a>) that represent the SMD phenotype only require one depressive symptom, which is that “nearly every day, mood between temper outbursts is persistently negative (irritable, angry, and/or sad).” Depressive disorders are exclusionary if the temper dysregulation occurs exclusively during an affective illness. The explosion of bipolar diagnoses in youths emerged because clinicians appeared to diagnose ADHD with only the symptom of irritability as bipolar disorder. This finding was not what Biederman's group identified (<a href=""#R34"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R34"">Wozniak et al., 1995</a>). DMDD criteria in their current form may be proposing an analogous diagnostic schema that minimizes depressive symptomatology and proposes diagnosing an affective disorder with one symptom, namely, negative mood. It might be more parsimonious that this new affective diagnostic grouping be labeled chronic depressive disorder with temper dysregulation. This labeling would then require a depressive symptom complex as seen in CDD. An analogous coding could be applied to those with MDD. Those without an affective disorder are within the irritable ODD/ADHD or anxious domain. This latter subset was almost one-quarter of the IRR subjects in this sample.</p>"
"<p id=""P31"">DSM IV-TR allows diagnosing children with an affective disorder if IRR is present. Although “pure” IRR affective disorder is only 8.4% of this sample, the children identified in this analysis appeared to have an irritable affective disorder with a distinct comorbid pattern. This diagnostic cluster clearly can be populated with those exhibiting variable severity as is apparent in MDD or in other diagnostic domains. A new diagnosis of DMDD may not be warranted because of its possible similarity to CDD until further clarity is available on the depressive symptom prevalence in DMDD. Clearly, the symptom of irritability is a potent mediator of ODD and MDDD within this ADHD sample. The predictive validity of this IRR depressive subtype remains to be seen, although the early finding of SMD/chronic irritability supports its depressive classification since it more likely predicts a later affective disorder than a bipolar outcome (<a href=""#R11"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R11"">Brotman et al., 2006</a>, <a href=""#R31"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R31"">Stringaris et al., 2012</a>). Its relationship to anger attacks in adults (<a href=""#R19"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R19"">Fava and Rosenbaum, 1999</a>) with depression or intermittent explosive disorder (<a href=""#R15"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R15"">Coccaro, 2010</a>) is also unclear.</p>"
"<p id=""P32"">This analysis is limited because it was from one clinical service that excluded presumed bipolar or major depressive subjects. Since this sample only included Caucasian ADHD children, the findings could be considered cohort specific; but, the Great Smoky Mountain Study also was predominately Caucasian youths (<a href=""#R11"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R11"">Brotman et al., 2006</a>). Nonetheless, this ADHD sample's clinical characteristics closely resemble other outpatient groups, placing it within the overall ADHD domain (<a href=""#R18"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R18"">Elia et al., 2008</a>). It may be that IRR has differing effects within other diagnostic groups. The young mean age of the sample (10.2 years; 78.6% &lt;13 years old) does restrict the comorbid pattern with disorders having a later age of onset, but older age would only tend to increase the prevalence of affective disorders (<a href=""#R17"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R17"">Costello et al., 2003</a>). In a longitudinal follow-up study averaging 7 years, <a href=""#R8"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R8"">Biederman et al. (2009)</a> noted that ADHD was a risk factor for a bipolar switch in those with a lifetime diagnosis of a unipolar depressive disorder. This does suggest that some of the ADHD depressives identified in this study could eventually exhibit a bipolar outcome. However, Biederman's samples did not exclude bipolarity and depression at baseline, which was an entry criterion for this current study.</p>"
"<p id=""P33"">This analysis clearly shows that irritability among children with ADHD is a potent symptom increasing comorbidity. It preferentially defines a cohort of affectively ill ADHD youth with predominantly comorbid behavioral symptoms. IRR does not act alone but appears intimately associated with temper tantrums and oppositionality to generate an affective diathesis. The finding that IRR is predictive of a concurrent affective disorder complements the predictive validity of this symptom to identify later affective disorders in young adulthood (<a href=""#R16"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R16"">Copeland et al., 2009</a>; <a href=""#R27"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R27"">Moreno et al., 2007</a>). It appears imperative to assess the ADHD child with irritability for low-grade affective disorders and conversely, the irritable child for affective illness. The symptomatology of RDC, defined minor depression, and DSM IIIR criteria for OAD appear relevant to this debate. It remains a heuristic question whether DMDD should be incorporated as a new affective diagnosis or alternately classified as a subtype of chronic depressive disorder.</p>"

"<p>Depressive disorders are common in young people and are associated with significant negative impacts. Newer generation antidepressants, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), are often used, however evidence of their effectiveness in children and adolescents is not clear. Furthermore, there have been warnings against their use in this population due to concerns about increased risk of suicidal ideation and behaviour.</p>"
"<p>To determine the efficacy and adverse outcomes, including definitive suicidal behaviour and suicidal ideation, of newer generation antidepressants compared with placebo in the treatment of depressive disorders in children and adolescents.</p>"
"<p>For this update of the review, we searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group's Specialised Register (CCDANCTR) to October 2011. The CCDANCTR includes relevant randomised controlled trials from the following bibliographic databases: CENTRAL (the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) (all years), EMBASE (1974 ‐), MEDLINE (1950 ‐) and PsycINFO (1967 ‐). We searched clinical trial registries and pharmaceutical company websites. We checked reference lists of included trials and other reviews, and sent letters to key researchers and the pharmaceutical companies of included trials from January to August 2011.</p>"
"<p>Published and unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cross‐over trials and cluster trials comparing a newer generation antidepressant with a placebo in children and adolescents aged 6 to 18 years old and diagnosed with a depressive disorder were eligible for inclusion. In this update, we amended the selection criteria to include newer generation antidepressants rather than SSRIs only.</p>"
"<p>Two or three review authors selected the trials, assessed their quality, and extracted trial and outcome data. We used a random‐effects meta‐analysis. We used risk ratio (RR) to summarise dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) to summarise continuous measures.</p>"
"<p>Nineteen trials of a range of newer antidepressants compared with placebo, containing 3335 participants, were included. The trials excluded young people at high risk of suicide and many co‐morbid conditions and the participants are likely to be less unwell than those seen in clinical practice. We judged none of these trials to be at low risk of bias, with limited information about many aspects of risk of bias, high drop out rates and issues regarding measurement instruments and the clinical usefulness of outcomes, which were often variously defined across trials. Overall, there was evidence that those treated with an antidepressant had lower depression severity scores and higher rates of response/remission than those on placebo. However, the size of these effects was small with a reduction in depression symptoms of 3.51 on a scale from 17 to 113 (14 trials; N = 2490; MD ‐3.51; 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐4.55 to ‐2.47). Remission rates increased from 380 per 1000 to 448 per 1000 for those treated with an antidepressant. There was evidence of an increased risk (58%) of suicide‐related outcome for those on antidepressants compared with a placebo (17 trials; N = 3229; RR 1.58; 95% CI 1.02 to 2.45). This equates to an increased risk in a group with a median baseline risk from 25 in 1000 to 40 in 1000. Where rates of adverse events were reported, this was higher for those prescribed an antidepressant. There was no evidence that the magnitude of intervention effects (compared with placebo) were modified by individual drug class.</p>"
"<p>Caution is required in interpreting the results given the methodological limitations of the included trials in terms of internal and external validity. Further, the size and clinical meaningfulness of statistically significant results are uncertain. However, given the risks of untreated depression in terms of completed suicide and impacts on functioning, if a decision to use medication is agreed, then fluoxetine might be the medication of first choice given guideline recommendations. Clinicians need to keep in mind that there is evidence of an increased risk of suicide‐related outcomes in those treated with antidepressant medications.</p>"

<p><strong>Newer antidepressants for depression in children and adolescents</strong></p>
"<p>Depression is common in young people and can contribute to a variety of negative outcomes, such as poor academic functioning, difficulties in peer and family relationships, increases in substance use, and both attempted and completed suicide. This review contained 19 trials (with a total of 3353 participants) testing the effectiveness of newer generation antidepressants (these are antidepressants developed and used since tricyclic antidepressants were developed). These include the well‐known selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors that have an impact primarily on the brain chemical called serotonin, as well as several other newer classes of antidepressants now being used, which aim to target noradrenaline and dopamine as well as serotonin and include selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (NRIs), norepinephrine dopamine reuptake inhibitors (NDRIs), norepinephrine dopamine disinhibitors (NDDIs) and tetracyclic antidepressants (TeCAs)) for the treatment of depression in children and adolescents. Based on 14 of the trials (2490 participants in total), there was evidence that those treated with an antidepressant had lower depression severity scores than those on placebo, however, the size of this difference was small. Based on 17 trials (3229 participants in total), there was evidence of an increased risk (64%) of suicide‐related outcomes for those on antidepressants compared with those given placebo. Where rates of adverse events were reported, this was higher for those prescribed an antidepressant. There was no evidence that one particular type of newer generation antidepressant had a larger effect than the others when compared to placebo.</p>"
"<p>It is unclear how meaningful the results regarding the effectiveness of these medications are in terms of a young person's day‐to‐day functioning. Children and adolescents with other conditions (such as anxiety, substance use disorder or a conduct disorder) as well as depression, and those at risk of suicide, were often excluded from trials. However, these young people are more representative of the population who present to clinical services, therefore it is not possible to predict how they would respond to antidepressants. There was often insufficient information to judge the quality of the trials accurately. With these limitations, it is difficult to answer questions about the effectiveness and safety of antidepressants for treating depression in children and adolescents. Clinicians need to provide accurate information to children and adolescents, and their families, about the uncertainties regarding the benefits and risks of newer generation antidepressant medication as a treatment option for depression. If a decision to use medication is agreed then fluoxetine might be the medication of first choice given guideline recommendations and, if used, the risk of suicide should be assessed and monitored particularly closely.</p>"

"<p>Overall there are relatively few long‐term studies on depressive disorders in children and adolescents. Despite what is known about its prevalence and impacts, there is relatively little evidence for effective treatments or their impact on prognosis (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0144"" class=""usa-link"">NICE 2005</a>). While a range of psychotherapies are effective (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0144"" class=""usa-link"">NICE 2005</a>), adolescents' response to psychotherapies may be weaker than adults (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0069"" class=""usa-link"">Cuijpers 2005</a>; <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0088"" class=""usa-link"">Gloaguen 1998</a>; <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0186"" class=""usa-link"">Weisz 2006</a>) and overall more research is required (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0144"" class=""usa-link"">NICE 2005</a>).</p>"
"<p>Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) have not been shown to be an effective pharmacological treatment for depressive disorder in young people (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0102"" class=""usa-link"">Hazell 2002</a>; <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0187"" class=""usa-link"">Weller 2000</a>). Newer generation antidepressants, especially selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), have been increasingly used in recent decades (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0182"" class=""usa-link"">Vitiello 2006</a>), with initial studies showing they were well tolerated (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0066"" class=""usa-link"">Cooper 1988</a>). However, concerns about the increased risk of suicide and suicide attempt on SSRIs were first raised in 2003 (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0104"" class=""usa-link"">Healy 2003</a>). Meta‐analyses examining the risks of suicide‐related behaviour and suicidal ideation combined (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0097"" class=""usa-link"">Hammad 2006</a>) or separately (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0072"" class=""usa-link"">Dubicka 2006</a>) have shown a consistent and modest increased risk of suicide for those taking SSRIs compared with placebo. Although debate about this issue is ongoing (e.g. <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0089"" class=""usa-link"">Goodyer 2010</a>; <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0107"" class=""usa-link"">Hetrick 2010</a>), the evidence for such risks has lead to action by regulatory bodies. The Committee on Safety of Medicines, Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the UK (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0068"" class=""usa-link"">CSM 2004</a>), the European Medicines Agency (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0077"" class=""usa-link"">EMEA 2005</a>) and the Food and Drug Administration (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0080"" class=""usa-link"">FDA 2004</a>) have cautioned practitioners in the use of SSRIs in children and adolescents, including an FDA 'black box' warning label issued 14 September 2004 (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0080"" class=""usa-link"">FDA 2004</a>).</p>"
"<p>In addition to SSRIs, several other classes of antidepressants are now being used, including selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (NRIs), norepinephrine dopamine reuptake inhibitors (NDRIs), norepinephrine dopamine disinhibitors (NDDIs) and tetracyclic antidepressants (TeCAs). SSRIs are sometimes referred to as 'second generation' antidepressants, and these newer additional classes are sometimes referred to as 'third generation' antidepressants. Rather than being a homogenous group based on mechanisms of action, however, third generation antidepressants are classed together because they are modified versions of first and second generation antidepressants (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0148"" class=""usa-link"">Olver 2001</a>). Given the use of these classes of antidepressants, this updated version of the review includes these and throughout the review, second and third generation antidepressants are referred to as 'newer generation' antidepressants.</p>"
"<p>Antidepressant medication has evolved over the past 50 years. Until recently, a widely held belief was that dysfunction in serotonergic neurons and their targets may underlie depressive symptomatology (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0181"" class=""usa-link"">van Praag 1987</a>). The dopaminergic system has also been implicated, given its association with reward and appetitive motivation, whereby depression is characterised by a diminished ability to experience pleasure. Serotonin does have modulatory effects on dopamine, either increasing or decreasing its activity depending on the concomitant action of other neurotransmitters and the receptor subtype it is acting on.</p>"
"<p>SSRIs cause an initial inhibition of the reuptake of serotonin (5‐hydroxytryptimine, or 5‐HT) (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0127"" class=""usa-link"">Lenox 2008</a>), but while this effect occurs within hours of taking the medication, the clinical effects are not evident for some weeks. This suggests it may be the downstream effects of reuptake inhibition on gene expression and receptor regulation that are chiefly responsible for the clinical effects of SSRIs (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0055"" class=""usa-link"">Castren 2005</a>). SSRIs also affect other neurotransmitters, including noradrenaline and dopamine (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0103"" class=""usa-link"">Healy 1997</a>).</p>"
"<p>A third generation of antidepressants target the noradrenaline and dopamine systems to a greater degree than the SSRIs, though most also have an effect on the serotonergic system (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0103"" class=""usa-link"">Healy 1997</a>). There is significant interplay between the monoaminergic systems, rendering efforts to reduce antidepressant action to their effects on a single system simplistic.</p>"
"<p>This review refers to 'newer generation antidepressants' which encompasses both SSRIs and third generation antidepressant medication. It is unlikely that even within class these antidepressants will have similar effectiveness; similar to the multi‐treatments meta‐analysis by <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0060"" class=""usa-link"">Cipriani 2009</a> we have pooled all individual compounds (rather than pooling within class) in order to look at whether the effect of newer antidepressants is modifiable by individual compound type (but we cannot assess comparative effectiveness given this is not a multi‐treatments meta‐analysis).</p>"
"<p>The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatrists, in response to the initial black box warnings, expressed concern about a stand that will deprive young people of effective treatment for a condition that carries with it considerable morbidity and mortality (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0051"" class=""usa-link"">Brent 2004</a>; <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0081"" class=""usa-link"">Findling 2004</a>). Similarly, reviews examining the risks and benefits of antidepressants, most commonly SSRIs, consistently highlight the potentially serious consequences of untreated depression in children and adolescents. While modest treatment benefits have been shown for fluoxetine in children and adolescents (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0106"" class=""usa-link"">Hetrick 2007</a>; <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0189"" class=""usa-link"">Whittington 2004</a>), there is contention about the effectiveness of other newer generation antidepressants.

"<p>1.1 Depression symptom severity (clinician‐rated) using the Children's Depression Rating Scale (CDRS‐R). This outcome was chosen on the basis of a hierarchy of rating scales based on psychometric properties and appropriateness for use with children and adolescents and for consistency of use across trials (the most commonly used tool) (see <a href=""#CD004851-sec-0176"" class=""usa-link"">Appendix 1</a>). The CDRS‐R was adapted for children and adolescents from the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM‐D), a tool validated and commonly used in adult populations (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0053"" class=""usa-link"">Brooks 2001</a>). Both the CDRS‐R and HAM‐D have good reliability and validity (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0053"" class=""usa-link"">Brooks 2001</a>). The Montgomery‐Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) was also based on the HAM‐D but designed to better assess sensitivity to change. However, it was not designed specifically for children and adolescents (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0053"" class=""usa-link"">Brooks 2001</a>)</p>"
"<p>1.2. Remission or response as defined by trialists. 'Remission' and 'response' are commonly defined by dichotomising a continuous measure of clinician‐rated depression symptoms. The labelling of remission and response varied across trials, with the labelling being different even although the cut‐point was the same. For consistency across trials, we chose the most commonly reported cut‐point, which was generally referred to as 'remission' (CDRS‐R ≤ 28). When 'remission' was not reported, we used 'response' if available (we have used last observation carried forward (LOCF) data in the first instance (see <a href=""#CD004851-sec-0041"" class=""usa-link"">Dealing with missing data</a>) so that if remission was only available from observed case (OC) data but response data were available from LOCF data, we have used response data). The outcome represents some measure of improvement, but there are difficulties in interpretation because of the inconsistencies in scales and cut‐points (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0107"" class=""usa-link"">Hetrick 2010</a>)<em>.</em></p>"
"<p>We have chosen to include both continuous and dichotomised measures of clinician‐rated depression symptoms (outcomes 1.1 and 1.2/1.3 respectively), since there are advantages and disadvantages to each. Responder analyses (based on the dichotomised continuous outcomes) are well known to be problematic (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0121"" class=""usa-link"">Kieser 2004</a>), with arbitrariness in the choice of cut‐point, loss of power resulting from the dichotomisation (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0040"" class=""usa-link"">Altman 2006</a>) and difficulties in interpretation (as outlined above). However, synthesising continuous outcomes is not without its difficulties. The scales used to measure depression symptoms vary across trials; there is inconsistency in the analytical methods employed (e.g. analyses of change scores, regression models), which can preclude the use of the standardised mean difference; and there are also interpretational difficulties.</p>"
"<p>1.4 Depression symptom severity ‐ self rated (on standardised, validated, reliable depression rating scales).

"<p>The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group (CCDAN) maintain two clinical trials registers at their editorial base in Bristol, UK, a references register and a studies‐based register. The CCDANCTR‐References Register contains over 30,000 reports of randomised controlled trials in depression, anxiety and neurosis. Approximately 65% of these references have been tagged to individual, coded trials. The coded trials are held in the CCDANCTR‐Studies Register and records are linked between the two registers through the use of unique Study ID tags. Coding of trials is based on the EU‐Psi coding manual. Please contact the CCDAN Trials Search Co‐ordinator for further details.</p>"
"<p>Reports of trials for inclusion in the Group's registers are collated from routine (weekly), generic searches of MEDLINE (1950 ‐), EMBASE (1974 ‐) and PsycINFO (1967 ‐); quarterly searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and review‐specific searches of additional databases. Reports of trials are also sourced from international trials registers c/o the World Health Organization’s trials portal (ICTRP), ClinicalTrials.gov, drug companies, the handsearching of key journals, conference proceedings and other (non Cochrane) systematic reviews and meta‐analyses. Details of CCDAN's generic search strategies can be found on the Group‘s website.</p>"

<p>We screened the reference lists of included articles and other reviews retrieved in the search.</p>
"<p>We searched pharmaceutical company websites, including Eli Lilly and Company, Forest Laboratories, Merck Pharmaceuticals, Lundbeck Pharmaceuticals, GlaxoSmithKline, Brystol‐Myers Scuibb and Pfizer Pharmceuticals (the company Wyeth that was searched in original review has been subsumed by Pfizer).</p>"
<p>We searched conference abstracts for the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2003 to 2005) for the original review.</p>
<p>We consulted the authors of the included trials and other individuals with expertise in this field to find out if they knew of any potentially relevant published or unpublished RCTs/controlled clinical trials (CCTs).</p>
"<p>Two review authors (MS and GC) performed the selection of trials for inclusion in the updated review independently after employing the search strategy described above. Where a title or abstract appeared to describe a trial eligible for inclusion, we obtained the full article to assess whether it met the inclusion criteria.

"<p>Two review authors (SH and GC) independently extracted information on each trial, including 'Risk of bias' criteria and details of participants, interventions, comparisons, outcomes and potential modifying factors (age, individual drug type).

"<p>Two review authors (SH and GC) independently extracted post intervention outcome data for the primary and secondary outcomes and discrepancies were resolved by a third review author (JM). When estimates of treatment effect or standard errors were not directly reported, we calculated these, where possible, through algebraic manipulation of available statistics (e.g. means, confidence interval limits, exact P values).</p>"
"<p>For the first version of the review we decided post hoc to extract suicide‐related outcomes from the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) rather than from the individual trial reports retrieved in the search for the current review. The MHRA has produced a web‐based report (<a href=""http://www.mhra.gov.uk/"" class=""usa-link usa-link--external"" data-ga-action=""click_feat_suppl"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">www.mhra.gov.uk/</a>) that summarises the results of the majority of the trials included in the original review. We used two additional reports, one on suicide‐related outcomes (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0096"" class=""usa-link"">Hammad 2004</a>) and one on trial characteristics (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0073"" class=""usa-link"">Dubitsky 2004</a>) giving details of outcomes for 25 SSRI trials for a range of disorders in children and adolescents. For this version of the review, we have again used the data from the FDA report of suicide‐related outcomes where it is available and where it is not, extracted data as similar in definition to that used in this report from individual trials.</p>"
"<p>In the original review we assessed the risk of bias in the included trials using the quality of trials ratings devised by Moncrieff and colleagues (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0136"" class=""usa-link"">Moncrieff 2001</a>). For this update we used the Cochrane Collaboration's new 'Risk of bias' tool (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0110"" class=""usa-link"">Higgins 2009</a>). Specifically, for each trial, we assessed the domains sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and assessors (separately for efficacy outcomes and adverse outcomes), incomplete outcome data and selective reporting. We sought to assess trial protocols where published/available in the first instance and also sought clarification from trial authors in the case of suspicion of reporting bias) and any other sources of possible bias that which might affect the outcome of the trial results. We judged each domain as being at a low, high or unclear risk of bias. We also extracted relevant text which underpinned our judgement and this is presented in the 'Risk of bias' tables in <a href=""#CD004851-sec-0198"" class=""usa-link"">Characteristics of included studies</a>.</p>"
"<p>Two review authors (SH and GC) performed all assessments of the quality of trials independently, with discrepancies resolved by JM. </p>"
"<p>For dichotomous outcomes, we measured treatment effects using risk ratios (RR) (e.g. response rates and adverse effects). In the original version of this review, a post hoc decision was made not to calculate number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) and number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) primarily because these effect measures have undesirable statistical properties and can be difficult to interpret (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0116"" class=""usa-link"">Julious 2005</a>; <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0192"" class=""usa-link"">Wisloff 2011</a>). Instead, in our <a href=""#CD004851-tbl-0001"" class=""usa-link"">Table 1</a>, we present estimates of risk difference, in addition to risk ratios, to aid interpretation, for a range of control group rates (lowest, highest and median rate derived from the placebo groups).</p>"
"<p>For each drug, we estimated the risk ratio of experiencing adverse events (where a count of any adverse event was reported). However, given inconsistencies in data collection of these events between trials, the risk ratios may not be comparable between drugs; therefore, information about adverse events is also presented in <a href=""#CD004851-tbl-0005"" class=""usa-link"">Table 5</a>.</p>"
"<p>For continuous outcomes (such as clinician‐rated depression symptom severity), we have used the mean difference (MD). In the majority of trials, multiple linear regression models had been fitted, and ‘adjusted’ estimates of treatment effects from these models were reported (often as least square means or least square mean differences). These models adjusted for varying factors such as age, sex, investigator site and baseline of the outcome (details available from the review authors). We were not able to use the standardised mean difference (SMD) where the same outcome was measured across trials, but using a different scale because there was inconsistency in the analytical methods employed (e.g. analyses of final values, change scores and regression models).</p>"
"<p>We presented data that could not be meta‐analysed, such as information on co‐morbidity, and treatment effects for trials that have used different scales than our chosen scale, in tables.</p>"
"<p>There were no trials with more than one intervention arm compared with the placebo group. In future updates, if this occurs, we will compare data from each arm with the placebo group. We will divide the sample size in the placebo arm by the number of intervention arms included in the meta‐analysis to preclude multiple counting of trial participants. While this approach offers some solution, it does not completely account for the correlation arising from using the same set of participants in the placebo comparison group (Chapter 16, <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0110"" class=""usa-link"">Higgins 2009</a>).</p>"
"<p>No cross‐over trials were included, but if they are located in future updates, if the appropriate data for a paired t‐test analysis is not available and cannot be obtained from trial authors, we will impute missing statistics (e.g. missing standard deviation, correlation) using data available from other trials included within the meta‐analysis, or trials outside the meta‐analysis (Chapter 16, <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0110"" class=""usa-link"">Higgins 2009</a>; <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0076"" class=""usa-link"">Elbourne 2002</a>). We will use sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of the pooled treatment effect to assumptions made regarding missing statistics.</p>"
"<p>If cluster‐RCTs are included in future updates, which have not appropriately adjusted for the correlation between participants within clusters, we will contact trial authors to obtain an estimate of the intra‐cluster correlation (ICC), or imputed using estimates from the other included trials or from similar external trials. We will inflate the trial standard errors (Chapter 16 <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0110"" class=""usa-link"">Higgins 2009</a><em>)</em>.</p>"
"<p>We sought additional data from the principal authors and pharmaceutical companies of trials (the latter approached by the CCDAN group on our behalf) (and the National Institutes for Mental Health (NIMH) in the case <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0016"" class=""usa-link"">TADS 2004</a>) that met the eligibility criteria where the data were missing, or were in a form unsuitable for meta‐analysis. We also searched the pharmaceutical company websites for additional data on included trials.</p>"
"<p>Most trials used the last observation carried forward (LOCF) method of data imputation for the majority of outcomes, that is, the last observed value for a participant lost to follow‐up is assigned as the follow‐up value. We chose to pool LOCF data (rather than mix LOCF and OC data).</p>"
"<p>The observed case remission/response data were sought since we planned to investigate the effect of missing data using the "" informative missingness odds ratios "" (IMOR) framework (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0109"" class=""usa-link"">Higgins 2008</a>). However, only a few trials reported observed case data for this outcome (paroxetine trials, sertraline trials, one trial of citalopram and one small trial of fluoxetine) and we were unsuccessful in obtaining observed case data for the other trials. We have undertaken sensitivity analysis using OC data where available. Estimates of treatment effect based on either LOCF or OC data can result in serious bias (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0175"" class=""usa-link"">Sterne 2009</a>).</p>"
"<p>In some trials, least squares means and their standard errors were reported from regression models by treatment group, but no contrast between groups was reported. For these trials, we estimated the variance of the treatment effect by summing the square of the standard errors in each treatment group. There may be some inaccuracy in this approach when there is imbalance in the covariates being adjusted for.</p>"
"<p>We assessed heterogeneity of intervention effects by visually inspecting the overlap of confidence intervals on the forest plots, tested for heterogeneity using the Chi<sup>2</sup> test, and quantified heterogeneity using the I<sup>2</sup> statistic (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0108"" class=""usa-link"">Higgins 2003</a>). Categories suggested in <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0110"" class=""usa-link"">Higgins 2009</a> (Chapter 9) are used to help interpret the degree of heterogeneity (0% to 40% might not be important; 30% to 60% may represent moderate heterogeneity; 50% to 90% may represent substantial heterogeneity; 75% to 100% considerable heterogeneity). We calculated 95% confidence intervals for values of I<sup> 2</sup> using the non central Chi<sup>2</sup> approximation implemented in the Stata module <em>heterogi (</em><a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0150"" class=""usa-link"">Orsini 2006</a>).</p>"
"<p>We investigated the potential for small‐study effects using funnel plots and contour‐enhanced funnel plots. Contour‐enhanced funnel plots aid in determining if funnel plot asymmetry is due to publication bias or other factors (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0151"" class=""usa-link"">Peters 2008</a>; <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0176"" class=""usa-link"">Sterne 2011</a>). The outcomes 'remission/response' and suicide‐related behaviour were chosen since they were available for the majority of included trials. We have used the statistical test proposed by Harbord et al (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0098"" class=""usa-link"">Harbord 2006</a>) (as implemented in the Stata module <em>metabias (</em><a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0099"" class=""usa-link"">Harbord 2009</a>)) to test for small‐study effects.</p>"
"<p>We pooled estimates of treatment effect using inverse variance weighting, using a random‐effects model. DerSimonian and Laird’s method of moments estimator was used to estimate between‐trial variance (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0071"" class=""usa-link"">DerSimonian 1986</a>). We made the decision to use a random‐effects model since there was expected clinical diversity in the antidepressant medications, given their differing actions on various monoaminergic systems. Where trials did not report data suitable for meta‐analysis, treatment estimates or raw data (as appropriate for each outcome) for each individual study are reported in additional tables.</p>"
"<p>We judged randomised trials to be at a low risk of bias if they met the following criteria: a low risk of bias for sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and assessors, incomplete outcome data, and selective outcome reporting. We summarised the risk of bias across the trials in the text of the review. As part of the sensitivity analyses, we present meta‐analyses of trials that are judged to be at a low risk of bias for the outcomes depression symptom severity (CDRS‐R), remission/response and suicide‐related outcome.</p>"
"<p>We undertook a subgroup analysis based on the individual compounds to examine if the effect of newer generation antidepressants was modified by individual drug. Clinically, these drugs are used individually, with clinicians often trying to make a decision about which one is best to use for a particular individual.</p>"
"<p>There is evidence that children and adolescents may respond differently to pharmacological intervention, e.g. oral tricyclic antidepressants versus placebo significantly reduce symptoms in adolescents but not in children (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0102"" class=""usa-link"">Hazell 2002</a>). For this reason we conducted subgroup analyses by age, where children and adolescents were defined as those aged approximately 6 to 12 and 13 to 18 years respectively (<a href=""#CD004851-sec-0198"" class=""usa-link"">Characteristics of included studies</a>). When estimates of treatment effect were not presented for children and adolescents separately, we created another subgroup which contained both children and adolescents.</p>"
"<p>In the first version of the review, we had planned a priori to undertake subgroup analyses based on depressive disorder (major versus dysthymic disorder, depressive disorder not otherwise specified and 'double depression'), sex and co‐morbidity. However, due to limited data, we did not carry out analyses on these subgroups, nor was it possible in this update.</p>"
"<p>In the original review, we did not carry out pre‐planned sensitivity analyses based on pharmaceutical funding (financial support of trials by pharmaceutical companies has been shown to influence trial results (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0166"" class=""usa-link"">Schott 2010</a>)) and inclusion criteria (clinical diagnosis versus depression rating scales) since the majority of trials were pharmaceutically funded, and no trials used rating scales as inclusion criteria. We did not undertake a pre‐planned sensitivity analysis based on attrition rates since there were reasonably high attrition rates in all included RCTs (19% to 38%, <a href=""#CD004851-tbl-0006"" class=""usa-link"">Table 6</a>).</p>"
<p>SSRI: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor</p>
"<p>For this version of the review, we undertook sensitivity analyses based on the assessment of risk of bias in the trials (see <a href=""#CD004851-sec-0044"" class=""usa-link"">Data synthesis</a>), whereby trials deemed to be at a high risk of bias were excluded from the analysis.</p>"
<p>We undertook sensitivity analysis based on methods of imputation for missing data used by trial authors such that we substituted LOCF data for OC data for the outcome 'remission/response'.</p>
"<p>Finally, given the inclusion in this review of third generation antidepressants that have a different proposed mechanism of action from SSRIs, we have undertaken sensitivity analysis on the basis of drug class, excluding third generation antidepressants from the overall pooled analysis.</p>"
<p>Ongoing updates of this review will usually be submitted for editorial review within two years of publication of the review.</p>
"<p>Twelve trials were included in the original review (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0106"" class=""usa-link"">Hetrick 2007</a>), with data extracted from 10 trials and pooled in one or more meta‐analyses. As our inclusion criteria have been expanded to include newer classes of antidepressants, four trials excluded from the original review have been included in this version of the review (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0007"" class=""usa-link"">Emslie 2007 Trial 1</a>; <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0008"" class=""usa-link"">Emslie 2007 Trial 2</a>; <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0011"" class=""usa-link"">Mirtazapine Trial 1</a>; <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0013"" class=""usa-link"">Mirtazapine Trial 2</a>).</p>"

The remaining three symptom areas (depressed facial affect, listless speech and hypoactivity) are rated by the clinician on the basis of the child's non verbal behaviour in the room. Each symptom is graded on a five or seven‐point scale. For items 1 to 14 the highest ratings from the child, parent or other caretaker are taken as the <em>item</em> scores.

"<p>The BDI (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0046"" class=""usa-link"">Beck 1961</a>) is the first and most widely used self rated tool to assess depression severity, consisting of 21 items of which there are four item choices related to how the respondent has felt in the last week. The range of possible scores is from 0 to 63, with higher scores indicating worse depression severity. The tool was developed for adults (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0053"" class=""usa-link"">Brooks 2001</a>). The CDI (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0125"" class=""usa-link"">Kovacs 1992</a>) was based on the BDI but specifically developed for children aged seven years and older and has been frequently used in younger adolescents.

"<p>The Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0043"" class=""usa-link"">APA 2000</a>) measure is a clinician‐rated scale that assesses the patient's current level of functioning.

The first three categories are rated on an ordinal scale ranging from 0 (""does not do"") to 4 (""does every time there is an opportunity""). While the last categories consist of ""yes"" (coded 1) and ""no"" (coded 0) questions. A total score and a sub‐score for each of the four categories are calculated, with higher values indicating a greater degree of autonomy. There has been little psychometric investigation of this measure.</p>"
"<p>Suicide‐related outcomes were classified and reported in various ways in each of the trials. As described in the methods section, a post hoc decision was made in the first version of this review to use the data provided in an FDA report (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0096"" class=""usa-link"">Hammad 2004</a>) in order to overcome inconsistent reporting of these outcomes across trial reports.</p>"
"<p>The process of the FDA in establishing the rate of suicide‐related outcomes for each trial was based on the following process. A group of 10 suicidology experts were assembled by Columbia University (led by Dr Kelly Posner). Suicide‐related outcomes were defined after careful deliberation by this expert panel as including 'definitive suicidal behaviour/ideation' (pg 8, <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0096"" class=""usa-link"">Hammad 2004</a>) and where more than one event was recorded for an individual, the most severe event was used. The group of experts reviewed all of the suicide‐related adverse events, all serious adverse events and all accidental injuries identified by the sponsors of SSRI trials. There was some discrepancy between the sponsors' classifications and the expert panel classification (with 22 new events added, and 26 old events removed). Overall there were no completed suicides in any of the trials. The report highlighted the important point that none of these trials had adequate power for safety analysis.</p>"
"<p>For this version of the review we have again extracted suicide‐related outcomes from trials of depressive disorders from the FDA report (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0096"" class=""usa-link"">Hammad 2004</a>) where they were available.

Those who had made a significant suicide attempt within one year of screening or were currently at risk of suicide in the opinion of the investigator were excluded. It is unclear how long the screening for inclusion takes or whether there is a placebo lead‐in phase. There appears to be a continuation period for those on duloxetine with a 36‐week follow‐up.

There is little description of the blinding in 10 trials, so that it is unclear what ""double‐blind"" refers to (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0007"" class=""usa-link"">Emslie 2007 Trial 1</a>; <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0008"" class=""usa-link"">Emslie 2007 Trial 2</a>; <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0009"" class=""usa-link"">Emslie 2009</a>; <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0012"" class=""usa-link"">Mirtazapine Trial 1 &amp; 2</a>; <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0014"" class=""usa-link"">Paroxetine Trial 1</a>; <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0015"" class=""usa-link"">Simeon 1990</a>; <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0017"" class=""usa-link"">Von Knorring 2006</a>; <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0018"" class=""usa-link"">Wagner 2004</a>; <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0019"" class=""usa-link"">Wagner 2006</a>). <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0001"" class=""usa-link"">Almeida‐Montes 2005</a> and <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0016"" class=""usa-link"">TADS 2004</a> state that there were independent evaluators who were also ""blind"". <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0003"" class=""usa-link"">Emslie 1997</a> mentions that the pharmacy staff were blind. There were no reports on the success of blinding in any of the trials, and the possibility of clinicians or patients guessing the nature of the intervention from side effects was not discussed. Given outcomes were based on ratings by participants and clinicians, this could be an important omission, although the updated CONSORT guidelines highlight that asking participants or healthcare providers what intervention they received as a test of blinding at the end of the trial is confounded because usually by this stage they know what intervention they received (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0135"" class=""usa-link"">Moher 2010</a>).</p>"
"<p>One trial was discontinued early (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0015"" class=""usa-link"">Simeon 1990</a>) and it is unclear whether this is also the case for <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0036"" class=""usa-link"">Glod 2004</a>. One trial of paroxetine was aiming to recruit 65 participants in each of the treatment and placebo arms, however, it appeared to cease recruitment with less than half this number recruited to each group. The attrition rate for the 18 trials varied between 11% and 82% in the control groups and 14% and 58% in the intervention groups (see <a href=""#CD004851-tbl-0005"" class=""usa-link"">Table 5</a>). The disparity in attrition between treatment arms was of particular concern in the trials of fluoxetine (<a href=""#CD004851-tbl-0005"" class=""usa-link"">Table 5</a>).</p>"
"<p>All authors stated that intention‐to‐treat analyses (ITT) had been undertaken. However, a full application of the intention‐to‐treat principle is only possible when complete outcome data are available for all randomised participants (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0111"" class=""usa-link"">Hollis 1999</a>).

In the other trials, analyses are carried out on fewer patients than the number randomised. For the majority of trials, only those who received at least one dose of medication or placebo, or had at least one post baseline efficacy or safety evaluation were included in the analyses.</p>"
"<p>There is some evidence of reporting bias in some of the trials, though this is difficult to assess in most trials, since it was not possible to obtain the trial protocol. The trial report by <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0004"" class=""usa-link"">Emslie 2002</a> emphasises CDRS‐R scores and remission rates rather than response rate, even although response rate was specified as the primary outcome in the methods section. Additionally, the cut‐off used for remission rate differed from that stated in the methods section. <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0003"" class=""usa-link"">Emslie 1997</a> reports outcomes at five weeks rather than at the completion of the trial. In a letter to the editor, <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0010"" class=""usa-link"">Keller 2001</a> was criticised for changing the definition of response post data analysis to a cut‐off that showed treatment effectiveness (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0117"" class=""usa-link"">Jureidini 2003</a>). In response, <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0010"" class=""usa-link"">Keller 2001</a> changed their claim of finding a significant effect to stating that the findings showed a strong signal for efficacy (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0118"" class=""usa-link"">Jureidini 2004</a>; <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0120"" class=""usa-link"">Keller 2003</a>). In many trials response/remission is defined, measured and reported in many different ways within the trial, without it being clear what the primary outcome is, e.g. <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0009"" class=""usa-link"">Emslie 2009</a> reports two different results for response using two different definitions.

The outcomes for <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0016"" class=""usa-link"">TADS 2004</a> have been reported in multiple publications with the reporting of outcome results that are not consistent across papers. For trials where results are only reported in the MHRA report, there are few data reported (e.g. <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0012"" class=""usa-link"">Mirtazapine Trial 1 &amp; 2</a>). For one trial of paroxetine there is no publication except a brief pharmaceutical company trial report. In many cases, trials appear not to have measured or reported the outcomes specified as outcomes for this review, or have reported data in a way that means they cannot be used in meta‐analysis, so that there are data missing from the meta‐analyses.</p>"

"<p>Comparison 2: Newer generation antidepressant versus placebo (child vs adolescent), Outcome 3: Depressive symptom severity self rated</p>"
"<p>In the five trials of adolescents, or trials that provided data on functioning using the CGAS separately for adolescents, there was evidence that antidepressants improved functioning compared with placebo (MD 2.82; 95% CI 1.17 to 4.47) ( <a href=""#CD004851-fig-0021"" class=""usa-link"">Analysis 2.4</a>). Functioning data were not available separately for adolescents for the trials of sertraline (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0021"" class=""usa-link"">Wagner Trial 1&amp;2 (2003)</a>) or for the citalopram trial (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0018"" class=""usa-link"">Wagner 2004</a>).</p>"
"<p>While there was evidence of an increased risk of suicide‐related outcomes for adolescents receiving an antidepressant compared with placebo, the difference between groups was not statistically significant, although the effects encompassed by the confidence interval were generally suggestive of an increased risk (RR 1.47; 95% CI 0.99 to 2.19) ( <a href=""#CD004851-fig-0022"" class=""usa-link"">Analysis 2.5</a>).</p>"
"<p>There were six trials of adolescents or trials that reported data separately for adolescents and combined. There was an increased risk of adverse events in those taking antidepressants compared with placebo (RR 1.11; 95% CI 1.04 to 1.19) ( <a href=""#CD004851-fig-0023"" class=""usa-link"">Analysis 2.6</a>).</p>"
<p>Data on trial completion by age group were not available.</p>
"<p>We cannot make any comment on the comparative efficacy of individual antidepressant compounds. However, based on our meta‐analyses, there was no evidence that the magnitude of intervention effects (compared with placebo) was modified by individual drug class. Pooled results showed some evidence that depression symptoms were reduced and that remission/response rates were higher in those taking a newer generation antidepressant compared to placebo. The clinical importance of these effects is unclear. Overall, the reduction in depression symptoms was relatively small at 3.51 (on a scale with a range from 17 to 113) (<a href=""#CD004851-tbl-0001"" class=""usa-link"">Table 1</a>) and remission rates overall increased from 380 per 1000 (based on the median risk in the placebo group at post intervention) to 448 per 1000 (<a href=""#CD004851-tbl-0001"" class=""usa-link"">Table 1</a>). Even for those drugs that had consistent evidence of efficacy across more than one outcome (fluoxetine and escitalopram), the reduction in average scores was 5.63 lower for those taking fluoxetine and 2.67 lower for those on escitalopram compared with those on placebo. <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0156"" class=""usa-link"">Poznanski 1996</a> found a difference of 25 points on the CDRS‐R scale between a clinically referred depressed group (n = 60) and a non clinical group (n = 223), and a difference of 19 points between clinically referred groups with (n = 60) and without depressive disorder (n = 18) (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0156"" class=""usa-link"">Poznanski 1996</a>, pg 53). There was also a relatively small effect on functioning with those receiving fluoxetine and escitalopram having a score on average 3.08 higher and 2.28 points higher respectively than placebo on the CGAS (range 0 to 100). For fluoxetine, remission rates overall increased from 214 per 1000 (based on the median risk in the placebo groups at post intervention) to 315 per 1000 (a difference of 101 with 95% confidence interval (CI) from 6 more to 231 more). While significantly more young people recover if on fluoxetine, the remission rates are relatively low overall indicating many young people do not experience a clinically meaningful reduction in symptoms. Methodological issues including large attrition rates and inappropriate outcome measurement, with the associated potential for selective reporting, make it difficult to draw conclusions about the clinical benefit.</p>"
"<p>In addition, the efficacy results need to be balanced with evidence about adverse outcomes. Over all drugs, the risk of a suicide‐related outcome for those taking antidepressants was 58% (95% CI 2% to 245%) higher compared to those taking placebo. This equates to an increased of risk in a group with a median baseline risk from 25 in 1000 to 40 in 1000 (<a href=""#CD004851-tbl-0001"" class=""usa-link"">Table 1</a>). There was some variability in the risk of suicide‐related outcomes across the drugs (I<sup>2</sup> = 22%; 95% CI 0% to 58%), but this was not statistically significantly different. Suicidal ideation was only measured in two trials with no effect of antidepressant treatment evident. Adverse events were greater for those taking an antidepressant, and there was no effect of antidepressant on the rate of trial completion.</p>"
"<p>There were few data available to investigate whether age modified the intervention effect. There was no evidence from the available data that age modified the effects of antidepressant medication. The evidence of the effectiveness of antidepressants for children was inconsistent, with a small overall reduction in depression symptoms (3.18) and remission rates in one study (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0004"" class=""usa-link"">Emslie 2002</a>) of 44% for those receiving fluoxetine compared to 18% for those receiving placebo and in the other (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0005"" class=""usa-link"">Emslie 2006</a>) 69% for those receiving escitalopram and 52% for those receiving placebo. For adolescents, there was consistent evidence across both these outcomes of antidepressants compared with placebo. However, the same cautions apply in terms of methodological considerations and the size of the effects.</p>"
"<p>In this review, to our knowledge, we have presented data on efficacy and adverse outcomes, including suicide‐related outcomes, from all published and unpublished trials examining the use of newer antidepressants for child and adolescent depressive disorder. Despite attempts to contact all trial authors, as well as pharmaceutical companies responsible for funding the included trials, there are many instances of missing data in terms of effect estimates. In two cases there is very limited reporting of trials by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), with publication in peer‐reviewed journals not yet available (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0012"" class=""usa-link"">Mirtazapine Trial 1 &amp; 2</a>). Likewise the trial by <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0015"" class=""usa-link"">Simeon 1990</a>, which was stopped early, has never been published. We were unable to obtain any further report of the trial <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0036"" class=""usa-link"">Glod 2004</a>, the preliminary findings of which were published in a conference abstract.</p>"
"<p>The comparator group has an impact on the size of the effect and, in this case, the size of the effect in the placebo groups in these trials has been commented on (e.g. <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0118"" class=""usa-link"">Jureidini 2004</a>) and authors of the included trial reports themselves have commented, suggesting, for example, that this may be to do with the large amount of contact trial participants receive. Trials consistently include regular (often weekly) assessments and in a significant number of trials some sort of supportive contact or therapy was allowed. The interaction between participants and trial investigators was seldom standardised, as shown in a trial specifically investigating this issue, and while this interaction is typical of what takes place in real world clinical encounters, it impacts in an unknown way on the detection of differences between the active drug and placebo (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0074"" class=""usa-link"">Dunlop 2010</a>).</p>"
"<p>The characteristics of the participants also impact on the intervention effect. It is possible, for example, that the effect shown in the fluoxetine trials may be due to exclusion of placebo responders in the lead‐in time to the start of the trial. The placebo remission rate was higher in trials of other compounds and has previously been cited as a cause for concern regarding the efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0142"" class=""usa-link"">Newman 2004</a>). Again, it is notable that in the trials of fluoxetine the attrition rate was consistently higher in the placebo group compared with the fluoxetine group. There were generally very high attrition rates in all of the trials and it is unclear what effect this has on treatment estimates.</p>"
"<p>The young people in the trials are not likely to be representative of clinical populations typically seen in public child and adolescent mental health services as most trials included recruitment using advertisement, excluded many comorbid disorders, and in many trials excluded those who responded to placebo in the lead‐in stage of the trial. Also excluded were those at risk of suicide despite suicide‐related behaviours and comorbidity being significant features of clinically referred young people with depressive disorders (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0047"" class=""usa-link"">Birmaher 1996</a>; <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0123"" class=""usa-link"">Kovacs 1984</a>; <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0132"" class=""usa-link"">Marttunen 1998</a>; <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0152"" class=""usa-link"">Petersen 1993</a>). The baseline severity of young people included was in the moderately severely ill range, with a large proportion of included participants experiencing their first episode of depression (although in many cases this first episode was of a long duration). The effectiveness of newer generation antidepressants in young people with more severe disorders and complex presentations, including comorbid conditions and suicide risk, is therefore unknown.</p>"
"<p>There was limited information on the conduct of trials in relation to allocation concealment, blinding and compliance. Blinding is an issue when clinician‐rated scales are the main outcome, particularly in the context of an inactive placebo where it may be possible to guess the assigned treatment group given side and other physiological effects likely in this group (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0137"" class=""usa-link"">Moncrieff 2004</a>). In most cases the write‐up simply indicated that the trial was 'double‐blind', some stating that the placebo and medication capsules were identical and some stating that clinicians or trial personnel and participants were blinded. Only one trial specifically stated that outcome assessors were blinded.</p>"
"<p>The issue of reporting bias is important. <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0122"" class=""usa-link"">Kirsch 2008</a> highlight in their meta‐analysis of all trials of antidepressants submitted to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that effect sizes are smaller when unpublished studies are included and <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0179"" class=""usa-link"">Turner 2008</a> showed that whether and how trials of antidepressants were published depended on the outcome of the trial. We located several trials that have not been fully reported or published at all. It is also worth noting that in many cases we were unable to obtain the required data from the published paper but had to contact authors or the pharmaceutical company. Reporting bias within the published reports of included trials was difficult to assess given the conduct of a trial can be obscured in the write‐up for publication. Full and explicit reporting of changes in outcome definition was only undertaken by one investigator, however the primary outcome was reported and findings discussed (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0003"" class=""usa-link"">Emslie 1997</a>; <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0118"" class=""usa-link"">Jureidini 2004</a>). The possibility of reporting bias was highlighted in a letter to the editor regarding post hoc alterations of response definitions in the trial by <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0010"" class=""usa-link"">Keller 2001</a> (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0117"" class=""usa-link"">Jureidini 2003</a>).</p>"
"<p>What level of improvement constitutes a meaningful clinical outcome is uncertain given response and remission were defined and reported variously both within and across trials, with the noted possibility of alteration of this definition, and the possibility of reporting bias as a result.</p>"
"<p>There was evidence of inappropriate methods of imputation with trialists often using last observation carried forward data (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0175"" class=""usa-link"">Sterne 2009</a>). It was often the case that some randomised patients were not included in the final analysis.</p>"
"<p>The majority of trials were pharmaceutically funded. Two of the four fluoxetine trials were not pharmaceutically funded (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0003"" class=""usa-link"">Emslie 1997</a>; <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0016"" class=""usa-link"">TADS 2004</a>) (the TADS trial had an unrestricted education grant from Eli Lily). Research has shown that across different health fields, pharmaceutically funded studies are more likely to have results favouring the pharmaceutical company's product (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0130"" class=""usa-link"">Lexchin 2003</a>; <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0173"" class=""usa-link"">Sismondo 2008</a>).</p>"
"<p>A standard definition of remission or response would have been ideal; however, to calculate this individual patient data would have been necessary. Further, given a diagnosis of major depressive disorder on DSM criteria was an entry criterion for most of the trials, this may be considered the most desirable outcome measure.</p>"
"<p>Additionally, given symptom improvement or resolution does not necessarily correlate with improvements in functioning (see <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0191"" class=""usa-link"">Winters 2005</a> for a review), the latter would seem a more clinically important patient outcome to collect. However, this was inconsistently measured and reported on scales that often did not have established psychometric properties. In trials that used the Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) (an adaptation of the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) used in adults), there was some evidence that functioning was improved for those on an antidepressant compared with placebo. Self report data may also tap an outcome that is meaningful to the young person, however, few individual trials reported this.</p>"
"<p>The trials are designed only to examine the short‐term effects of antidepressant medication, however, this does not preclude the possibility that the effectiveness of treatment is only apparent over a longer period of time. Long‐term follow‐up would be required to assess this.</p>"
"<p>It should be noted that the review process included collection of data from various sources. There were more complete data for the trials on paroxetine due to publication of trial reports by SmithKline Beecham on the internet. Details of aspects of trial methodology were relatively brief even in this case. Information and data from other trials were taken variously from scientific journal publications, from the MHRA data and, in some cases, obtained directly from trial authors and pharmaceutical companies.</p>"
"<p>We were unable to obtain a large number of potentially relevant publications to screen for inclusion. The majority of these were conference proceedings and there is some evidence that such data are often not published and that publication is associated with positive results (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0169"" class=""usa-link"">Sherer 2007</a>). However, funnel plots for the outcomes remission and suicide‐related behaviour were not suggestive of small‐study effects and, moreover, the contour‐enhanced funnel plots did not indicate that statistically significant results were more likely to be reported.</p>"
"<p>The issue of the efficacy of antidepressants and the associated suicide risk has been the topic of much research, review and debate in the literature.</p>"
"<p>Healy was one of the first to publish regarding the possibility of an increased risk of suicide associated with SSRIs (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0104"" class=""usa-link"">Healy 2003</a>). Since then, observational studies have highlighted an association between antidepressant use and suicide risk in adolescents. For example, <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0147"" class=""usa-link"">Olfson 2006</a> showed an association between use of antidepressants and suicide attempt in children and adolescents and <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0172"" class=""usa-link"">Simon 2006b</a> showed a greater risk of suicide attempt that resulted in hospitalisation for children and adolescents compared with adults.</p>"
"<p>Data on risk of suicide for children and adolescents have also come from meta‐analyses based on trial data submitted to the FDA (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0097"" class=""usa-link"">Hammad 2006</a>) and the Committee on Safety in Medicines in the UK (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0072"" class=""usa-link"">Dubicka 2006</a>) that show similar results to our review. These findings have more recently been extended to young adults (18 to 25‐year olds) (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0177"" class=""usa-link"">Stone 2009</a>). Additionally, <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0072"" class=""usa-link"">Dubicka 2006</a> analysed these data by type of suicide‐related outcome showing suicidal ideation in 1.2% of those on SSRIs compared with 0.8% on placebo (odds ratio (OR) 1.45; 95% CI 0.54 to 3.88), self harm in 3.3% of those on SSRIs versus 2.6% on placebo (OR 1.44; 95% CI 0.70 to 2.97) and attempts in 1.9% of those on an SSRI versus 1.2% on placebo (OR 1.70; 95% CI 0.76 to 3.81) (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0072"" class=""usa-link"">Dubicka 2006</a>). Another review (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0052"" class=""usa-link"">Bridge 2007</a>) calculated the risk difference for suicide‐related behaviours for antidepressant versus placebo for major depressive disorder (MDD) (13 trials), obsessive‐compulsive disorder (OCD) (six trials) and non OCD anxiety disorders (six trials). The risk difference for suicide‐related behaviours was not statistically significant for MDD alone, although the risk ratio was 1.6; 95% CI 1.0 to 2.7 (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0052"" class=""usa-link"">Bridge 2007</a>). The risk difference calculated by <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0052"" class=""usa-link"">Bridge 2007</a> was 1% compared with a risk difference of 1.5% based on risk ratio (assuming a median baseline risk) calculated in this review.</p>"
"<p>Counter to this evidence showing an increase in suicide‐related behaviours, several arguments have been mounted.</p>"
"<p>Firstly, observational and ecological studies have shown no increased suicide risk related to antidepressant use. For example, observational studies by <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0180"" class=""usa-link"">Valuck 2004</a> (a retrospective cohort study) and <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0174"" class=""usa-link"">Sondergard 2006</a> (a register‐linkage study) showed no statistically significant increases in suicide attempt (hazard ratio (HR) 1.43; 95% CI 0.89 to 2.82) and completed suicide (RR 4.47; 95% CI 0.95 to 20.96) (respectively) for children and adolescents taking antidepressants. Two reviews of studies investigating this link highlighted that observational studies have not shown a strong association between antidepressants and suicide risk (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0094"" class=""usa-link"">Hall 2006</a>; <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0114"" class=""usa-link"">Isacsson 2010</a>). <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0094"" class=""usa-link"">Hall 2006</a> highlighted that observational studies have tended to show that those at increased risk of suicide were more likely to be prescribed an antidepressant (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0094"" class=""usa-link"">Hall 2006</a>) and therefore the association between antidepressant use and adolescent suicide‐related behaviours may be more likely to be explained by severity of depression, and not caused by the antidepressant (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0085"" class=""usa-link"">Friedman 2007</a>; <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0171"" class=""usa-link"">Simon 2006</a>). However, issues of potential confounding bias arising in observational studies are minimised in trials where, on average, those in the intervention and control groups are comparable in both measured and unmeasured confounders.</p>"
"<p><a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0094"" class=""usa-link"">Hall 2006</a> and <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0114"" class=""usa-link"">Isacsson 2010</a> have highlighted that the majority of ecological studies have shown that suicide mortality has decreased when SSRI use has increased in various counties or regions (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0094"" class=""usa-link"">Hall 2006</a>). However, these studies either have not included children and adolescents or analysed this age group separately, with the exception of <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0146"" class=""usa-link"">Olfson 2003</a> in the US. <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0146"" class=""usa-link"">Olfson 2003</a> showed that increasing use of antidepressants was associated with a decreased suicide rate. A subsequent study using US and Dutch data showed a decrease in SSRI prescriptions associated with an increased suicide rate in both countries (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0087"" class=""usa-link"">Gibbons 2007</a>).</p>"
"<p>There are shortcomings to these types of ecological studies, which have been discussed in the debate in this area. It is commonly acknowledged that ecological studies are not able to establish a causal link. For example, it could be that there are lower suicide rates in countries with less stigma associated with seeking intervention for mental health disorders, where antidepressant prescriptions rates are therefore higher (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0092"" class=""usa-link"">Gunnell 2004</a>; <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0171"" class=""usa-link"">Simon 2006</a>). Ecological studies have focused on short time periods, for example, <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0105"" class=""usa-link"">Healy 2009</a> and <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0158"" class=""usa-link"">Reseland 2008</a> contend that ecological studies have omitted data from the 1960s and 1970s when suicide rates climbed despite the largest increase in antidepressant use seen in the last few decades; <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0163"" class=""usa-link"">Safer 2007</a> similarly argues that time periods prior to the introduction of SSRIs have not been included when drops in suicide rates were observed. Another issue of ecological studies is that the relationships observed between variables at the aggregated level may not be the same as those observed at the individual level. An example of this is the possibility that increased use of antidepressants may be due to chronic users not new users, whose risk of treatment‐induced suicide is less (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0158"" class=""usa-link"">Reseland 2008</a>). There are issues of confounding, for example fluctuations in suicide rates may be due to cultural and religious factors (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0070"" class=""usa-link"">De Leo 2002</a>). Further, there is the issue of redefinition of the outcome over time. For example, reanalysis of data on suicide rates, antidepressant sales and autopsy in Nordic countries highlighted the possibility that observed decreases in suicide rates may be due to falling autopsy rates, and an associated increased in the rate of deaths from unspecified causes (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0158"" class=""usa-link"">Reseland 2008</a>).</p>"
"<p>Finally, the observation of increased suicide rates associated with a decrease in the rate of SSRI prescriptions may be because the recent censure of SSRIs has resulted in pessimism about being able to provide effective treatment. This may have caused both a decrease in help seeking and a disinclination to diagnose depressive disorders, supported by data showing decreased rates of diagnosis for child and adolescent depression in the USA (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0131"" class=""usa-link"">Libby 2007</a>).</p>"
"<p>The fact that there were no reports of completed suicide in a total sample of 2240 young people has been highlighted. However, suicide is a rare event and much larger sample sizes with longer follow‐up would be needed to assess the risk fully. <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0105"" class=""usa-link"">Healy 2009</a> cautions that it is more accurate to state that no suicides were recorded and notes that large loss to follow‐up makes it possible that suicides did occur. Research suggests that the best predictor of eventual suicide completion is previous suicidal ideation and suicidal behaviour so that an increase in rates of these outcomes may increase the risk of future suicide completion (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0041"" class=""usa-link"">Andrews 1992</a>; <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0048"" class=""usa-link"">Brent 1986</a>; <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0049"" class=""usa-link"">Brent 1993</a>; <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0128"" class=""usa-link"">Lewinsohn 1996</a>). The trials included in our review and others do not provide long enough follow‐up to determine whether short‐term increased risk of suicide‐related outcomes is subsequently followed by a longer‐term risk reduction. An increase in risk followed by a steadily decreasing risk has been shown within one month of starting antidepressant use in one trial of adults (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0115"" class=""usa-link"">Jick 2004</a>). Data on timing of suicidal risk has been analysed from the <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0016"" class=""usa-link"">TADS 2004</a> trial and showed that there was no decrease in risk after one month as seen in adult data, again meaning it is unclear if there is a longer‐term risk reduction.</p>"
"<p>In all reviews the rates of suicide‐related behaviour are much lower than reports of suicidal ideation and behaviour in adolescents from the community. In some population‐based studies suicidal ideation is reported by as many as 12% to 23% of young people and suicide attempts by 4% to 8% of adolescents aged 13 to 18 years (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0039"" class=""usa-link"">AHRG 2003</a>; <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0090"" class=""usa-link"">Grunbaum 2002</a>; <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0128"" class=""usa-link"">Lewinsohn 1996</a>; <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0164"" class=""usa-link"">Sawyer 2001</a>). This could be explained by exclusion of those at risk of suicide from all but two trials (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0004"" class=""usa-link"">Emslie 2002</a>; <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0017"" class=""usa-link"">Von Knorring 2006</a>). Most trials also excluded those with many co‐morbid conditions. Co‐morbidity is related to an increased risk of suicidal ideation and suicidal behaviours (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0041"" class=""usa-link"">Andrews 1992</a>; <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0044"" class=""usa-link"">Asarnow 1992</a>; <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0048"" class=""usa-link"">Brent 1986</a>; <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0078"" class=""usa-link"">Esposito 2002</a>; <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0126"" class=""usa-link"">Kovacs 1993</a>; <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0168"" class=""usa-link"">Shaffer 1996</a>; <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0188"" class=""usa-link"">Wetzler 1996</a>).</p>"

"<p>Several reviews of the efficacy of SSRIs in children and adolescents with depression have been published. Earlier reviews based conclusions on narrative summaries of individual trial results (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0051"" class=""usa-link"">Brent 2004</a>; <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0057"" class=""usa-link"">Cheung 2005</a>; <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0183"" class=""usa-link"">Wagner 2005</a>) not meta‐analyses. Of these, the conclusions of <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0057"" class=""usa-link"">Cheung 2005</a> are the most conservative, stating data are limited, commenting specifically on the inappropriateness of the outcomes used and cautioning clinicians to consider the use of SSRIs carefully.</p>"
"<p>A number of meta‐analyses have been also published. In earlier meta‐analyses <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0118"" class=""usa-link"">Jureidini 2004</a> highlighted methodological problems, particularly regarding reporting, and concluded cautiously that there is only a small benefit of SSRIs that should be balanced with the risks. In contrast <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0065"" class=""usa-link"">Cohen 2004</a> concluded SSRIs are an effective treatment for adolescent depression based on data published up to that point. In the same year, a review by <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0189"" class=""usa-link"">Whittington 2004</a> highlighted the change in risk‐benefit profile when unpublished data were included; their inclusion resulted in a favourable risk‐benefit profile only for fluoxetine, with a number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) of 6 (95% CI 4 to 15) for remission, and 5 (95% CI 4 to 13) for response. More recently, <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0178"" class=""usa-link"">Tsapakis 2008</a> has published a systematic review including meta‐analyses of any antidepressant (including tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), SSRIs, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and new antidepressants) for children and adolescents up to the age of 20 with a depressive disorder. The authors' conclusions were cautious, highlighting limited efficacy, particularly for children and in studies that combine adolescents and children. They found little appreciable difference between different types of antidepressants, however, suggesting that fluoxetine may be more effective, especially for adolescents. Similar to our findings, they questioned the appropriateness of outcome measures and noted that the young people included in trials may not be representative of more classic 'adult major depression' and may be less severe that young people typically seen in clinical practice.</p>"
"<p>In a meta‐analysis of antidepressants for all age groups, <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0113"" class=""usa-link"">Ioannidis 2008</a> questioned the appropriateness of outcome measures used and highlighted issues related to selective and distorted reporting and interpretation, calling into the question the effectiveness of antidepressants even in adult populations.</p>"
"<p>The results of our review present a dilemma for those treating young people with depressive disorders. While overall the reduction in depression symptoms is statistically significant, there are questions about the clinical effectiveness. The trials are of young people not representative of those typically presenting for treatment in clinics and furthermore they had some significant methodological shortcomings, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions. Potential benefit must be balanced with the finding that SSRIs are associated with a statistically significant increased risk of suicide‐related behaviour (a combination of suicidal ideation and definitive suicidal behaviour). Much debate on this matter has taken place, with variable views.</p>"
"<p>While there is a lack of power to adequately examine rare events such as suicide‐related outcomes in trials, meta‐analysis offers a method for obtaining reliable evidence for these rare outcomes across trials. Given a lack of consistent measurement of various aspects of suicide risk, the clinical implications of the findings are still somewhat unclear.</p>"
"<p>It is unknown how children and adolescents with a depressive disorder and co‐morbid conditions, who are at risk of suicide (i.e. those more typical of the young people who present at health services), would respond to SSRIs. Overall, the data regarding the benefits of SSRIs for child and adolescent depression are far from compelling while the information on the risks is limited.</p>"
"<p>Clinically, it must be kept in mind that there are significant risks in not treating depressive disorder, which has an increased risk of suicide completion, as well as impacts on academic and social functioning (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0050"" class=""usa-link"">Brent 2002</a>; <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0075"" class=""usa-link"">Ebmeier 2006</a>; <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0082"" class=""usa-link"">Fleming 1993</a>; <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0129"" class=""usa-link"">Lewinsohn 1998</a>; <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0143"" class=""usa-link"">NHMRC 1997</a>; <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0157"" class=""usa-link"">Rao 1995</a>).</p>"
"<p>The evidence for the effectiveness of newer generation antidepressants compared with placebo in the treatment of depressive disorder in children and adolescents is not compelling; the overall effects of antidepressants compared with placebo were not modified by drug. The methodological shortcomings of the trials make it difficult to interpret outcome data on the efficacy of newer generation antidepressant medications. This is a particularly unsatisfactory since large numbers of children and adolescents have participated in trials, and we are still unable to answer the important clinical question of whether antidepressant medications are effective in treating depressive disorders. The search for treatments that reliably lead to good clinical outcomes must continue.</p>"
"<p>Even when there is evidence that newer generation antidepressants reduce depression symptom severity, it is unclear whether the difference in effect between antidepressants and placebo reflects a difference that is of clinical importance to patients. As trials have largely been done in children and adolescents with no co‐morbid conditions and with no significant suicidal ideation, it is unclear how children and adolescents with more serious difficulties and those at risk of suicide would respond. There is evidence to suggest an increased risk of suicide‐related behaviours (combined suicidal ideation and definitive suicidal behaviour) in those treated with antidepressant medication, but the importance of this is unclear as is the association between antidepressant medication and suicide completion. Untreated depressive disorder is associated with the risk of completed suicide and impacts on academic and social functioning.</p>"
"<p>For clinicians, the results of the review may mean that the threshold of severity for treatment of a depressive disorder with antidepressant medication is raised. Clinicians should make every effort to present the information on the potential benefits and risks of SSRIs, including the risks of untreated depression, and together with the child or adolescent and their family, consider the various options for treatment. This should include consideration of psychological treatments such as cognitive behavioural therapy and other non medication options. The risk of suicide should be assessed and, if medication is used, this should be monitored particularly closely. If a decision to use medication is agreed, then fluoxetine might be considered given it is recommended as first‐line medication in guidelines (<a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0134"" class=""usa-link"">McDermott 2011</a>; <a href=""#CD004851-bbs2-0144"" class=""usa-link"">NICE 2005</a>), although based on this review no definitive recommendations can potentially be made until the comparative effectiveness of individual drugs is examined in a multiple‐treatment meta‐analysis.</p>"
"<p>Given the evidence does not clearly answer questions about the effectiveness and harms of newer generation antidepressants, there is a need for further research.</p>"
"<p>It is clear from the results that we need more effective treatments for depressive disorders in young people. The debate about efficacy and risk of suicide illustrates that there is no one clearly effective treatment. Young people with a depressive disorder who present for treatment are likely to be different to those in the included trials in this review; moreover those presenting for treatment in clinical services are heterogenous. Trials should include young people more typical of those presenting to clinical services and allow analysis of different subgroups of these young people. This may be an important avenue of new research, for example, there may be a genetic underpinning to medication responsiveness.</p>"
"<p>Trials that are undertaken should address the methodological shortcomings identified in this review, including adequate blinding, particularly of outcome assessors, consistent definition and use of clinically important outcomes and longer‐term follow‐up.</p>"
"<p>Within the context of the currently available trial data, individual patient data meta‐analyses may be useful in examining whether the effect of treatment differs in particular subgroups.</p>"
"<p>In the meantime, given clinicians require guidance in terms of which individual antidepressant medication to use, in order to more robustly examine the comparative efficacy of these compounds, a multiple‐treatment meta‐analysis should be undertaken.</p>"

"<p>Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) may experience more frequent and severe psychological and physical pain complaints compared to those without depression. As the tolerance to psychological pain decreases in patients with MDD, the severity of suicidal ideation tends to increase. Furthermore, the tolerance for physical pain (TPP) has been related with suicidal behavior. We aimed to demonstrate the impact of TPP on suicidal ideation in patients with MDD in the presence of psychological pain.</p>"
"<p>We included 123 patients with MDD and 114 healthy volunteers who had no previous psychiatric diagnosis. Sociodemographic data form, Psychache Scale (PS) and Tolerance for Mental Pain Scale (TMPS) were used to assess psychological pain. Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSIS) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were administered to participants. To assess the TPP, we used a device based on the principle of electronic dynamometry.</p>"
"<p>The mean BDI, BSIS, PS, and TPP scores in the MDD group were higher, and the mean TMPS score was lower than those in the control group (<em>p</em> &lt; 0.001 for each, <em>p</em> = 0.03 for TPP). We found statistically significant correlations between BDI, TMPS, BSIS, PS, and TPP scores (<em>p</em> &lt; 0.05 for each). TPP was a partial mediator in the relationship between TMPS and BSIS scores (<em>β</em> = −1.814; <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001).</p>"
"<p>We found that tolerance of psychological pain was a strong predictor of suicidal ideation, and TPP was mediating this relationship. These findings suggest that considering both tolerance to psychological pain and TPP may be beneficial when assessing the risk of suicide in individuals with MDD.</p>"

"<p>Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common psychiatric disorder that is associated with high morbidity and mortality.

"<p>Many theories have been proposed on suicide. Shneidman’s theory of psychological pain explains the internal conflicts and suffering processes that lead to suicidal thoughts and behaviors. A lack of meaning in life, hopelessness, and psychological distress are the main factors in psychological pain theory, and there would be no suicide without psychache.<a href=""#cit0015"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""cit0015""><sup>15</sup></a> Orbach has suggested that a person experiencing psychological pain will withdraw from communication and become isolated. Furthermore, due to escalating psychological pain, life appears meaningless to the patient, leading to contemplation regarding ending their life to alleviate the suffering. Pompili reported that feelings of worthlessness, hopelessness, and helplessness are associated with suicide in patients with MDD and that the risk of suicide increases as the duration of the disorder increases, symptoms become heightened, and the response to treatment decreases. Moreover, Pompili suggested that psychological pain intensifies in patients with depression and that they consider life meaningless and tedious due to psychological pain. According to Joiner’s interpersonal theory of suicidal Behavior (ITPS), the main components of suicidality are the desire to die and suicidal capability. ITPS consists of the desire for suicide, which refers to a person’s state of having suicidal thoughts and desires; perceived acceptability of suicide, which refers to a situation in which a person accepts suicidal thoughts as usual; and capability for suicide, which refers to a person’s ability to commit suicide. Consequently, the risk of suicide is increased if a person has a high level of suicidal desire and acceptability and has developed suicidal functioning. The capability for suicide develops with increased tolerance to physical pain and insensitivity to fear.<a href=""#cit0021"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""cit0021""><sup>21</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href=""#cit0022"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""cit0022""><sup>22</sup></a> Psychache, tolerance for psychache, and hardiness of physical pain are the risk factors of suicide.

We hypothesized that suicidal thoughts would increase with increasing tolerances toward psychache and physical pain. Our secondary objective was to compare the risk factors, including tolerance for physical pain, tolerance for psychache, and severity of depressive symptoms, in terms of their effects on suicidal ideation. We hypothesized that, among all risk factors, tolerance for psychache is the strongest determinant of suicide. The tertiary objective of our study was to investigate whether tolerance toward physical pain increased in participants with MDD.

"<p>Patients with severe depressive symptoms or those who cannot tolerate psychological pain and avoid activities that would increase their tolerance for physical pain may experience a positive effect on suicidal thoughts.

"<p>This study had some limitations. We did not assess the severity of suicidal thoughts. Future research may benefit from a comprehensive assessment of suicidal thoughts using scales, such as the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale. The pressure method was used to evaluate acute pain tolerance. Using multiple pain tolerance assessment methods may have increased the generalizability of our findings. We suggest assessing pain tolerance using electrical, heat, and cold stimulations to identify the potential differences between these methods. We performed mediation analysis using a cross-sectional design, which is generally used to assess longitudinal processes. Future studies may need to overcome these limitations. We investigated the relationship between physical pain tolerance and suicidality in patients with MDD. Future studies should evaluate these variables in patients with various mental disorders, such as schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, bipolar disorder, and panic disorder, which will increase the generalizability of our findings. Although this study addressed inter-sex differences in pain tolerance, the pathophysiological basis remains unclear. This limitation can be overcome by considering the biological and psychological variables that may explain the differences between the sexes.</p>"
"<p>Estimating the likelihood of suicide can be achieved to a certain extent by considering various risk factors, such as prior suicide attempts, childhood traumas, and alcohol/substance abuse. Suicide risk is influenced by a multitude of factors, including biological elements, such as genetic and neurochemical parameters; clinical factors, such as mental and physical disorders; social factors, such as living conditions and economic hardships; and psychological factors, such as depression, hopelessness, and psychological distress. However, the prediction of suicidal behavior remains complex and intricate. It is worth noting that these risk factors typically encompass long-term behavioral risks rather than immediate ones, which adds to the complexity of prediction. The results of our study revealed the effects of physical pain tolerance on suicidal thoughts and provided a biological marker that can be used to evaluate patients at risk of suicide. Moreover, our results revealed that known psychological risk factors for suicide, along with biological and interview-measurable markers, such as tolerance to physical pain, are influential in suicidal ideation.<a href=""#cit0038"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""cit0038""><sup>38</sup></a></p>"
"<p>Despite the increasing number of treatment options, the absence of a decrease in suicide rates necessitates the evaluation of suicide from new perspectives. Tolerance of psychological pain is strongly related to suicidal ideation, and tolerance of physical pain plays a partial mediating role in this relationship. In patients with depression and a history of suicidal ideation, screening for the presence of TTP will help identify those at risk for suicide. These findings suggest that considering both tolerance for psychological and physical pain may be beneficial for assessing the risk of suicide in individuals with MDD.</p>"

"<p id=""Par1"">Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a debilitating psychiatric illness. However, there is currently no objective laboratory-based diagnostic tests for this disorder. Although, perturbations in multiple neurotransmitter systems have been implicated in MDD, the biochemical changes underlying the disorder remain unclear, and a comprehensive global evaluation of neurotransmitters in MDD has not yet been performed. Here, using a GC-MS coupled with LC-MS/MS-based targeted metabolomics approach, we simultaneously quantified the levels of 19 plasma metabolites involved in GABAergic, catecholaminergic, and serotonergic neurotransmitter systems in 50 first-episode, antidepressant drug-naïve MDD subjects and 50 healthy controls to identify potential metabolite biomarkers for MDD (training set). Moreover, an independent sample cohort comprising 49 MDD patients, 30 bipolar disorder (BD) patients and 40 healthy controls (testing set) was further used to validate diagnostic generalizability and specificity of these candidate biomarkers. Among the 19 plasma neurotransmitter metabolites examined, nine were significantly changed in MDD subjects. These metabolites were mainly involved in GABAergic, catecholaminergic and serotonergic systems. The GABAergic and catecholaminergic had better diagnostic value than serotonergic pathway. A panel of four candidate plasma metabolite biomarkers (GABA, dopamine, tyramine, kynurenine) could distinguish MDD subjects from health controls with an AUC of 0.968 and 0.953 in the training and testing set, respectively. Furthermore, this panel distinguished MDD subjects from BD subjects with high accuracy. This study is the first to globally evaluate multiple neurotransmitters in MDD plasma. The altered plasma neurotransmitter metabolite profile has potential differential diagnostic value for MDD.</p>"
"<p id=""Par2"">Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common mental illness, with more than 300 million people of all ages affected worldwide, according to a report by the World Health Organization in 2017<sup><a href=""#CR1"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR1"">1</a></sup>. MDD dramatically reduces the quality of life of the affected individuals, and causes them to function poorly at work, at school and in the family, and can also lead to suicide. MDD result from a complex interaction of social, psychological, and biological factors<sup><a href=""#CR2"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR2"">2</a>,<a href=""#CR3"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR3"">3</a></sup>. Despite extensive researches, the molecular biology mechanisms of depression remain poorly understood. Currently, diagnosis of MDD primarily relies on subjective identification of symptom clusters by psychiatrists, resulting in a high rate of misdiagnosis<sup><a href=""#CR4"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR4"">4</a>–<a href=""#CR6"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR6"">6</a></sup>. Because of the lack of an objective diagnostic method, fewer than half of MDD patients (in many countries, fewer than 10%) receive effective treatments<sup><a href=""#CR7"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR7"">7</a>,<a href=""#CR8"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR8"">8</a></sup>. Thus, an objective diagnostic approach for MDD would be of considerable clinical value.</p>"
"<p id=""Par3"">Our group has focused on MDD over a decade, and has previously conducted proteomics and non-targeted metabolomics studies on rodent models of depression, on non-human primate (Macaca fascfeiicularis) model, and on patients with MDD<sup><a href=""#CR9"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR9"">9</a>–<a href=""#CR15"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR15"">15</a></sup>. Previous studies have showed that perturbations in central and peripheral neurotransmitters are a hallmark of MDD. In particular, MDD patients showed disturbances in several neurotransmitters in the periphery and brain, including dopamine, glutamate, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and serotonin (5-HT)<sup><a href=""#CR5"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR5"">5</a>,<a href=""#CR16"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR16"">16</a>–<a href=""#CR18"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR18"">18</a></sup> which were thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of the disorder. These studies suggest that numerous neurotransmitters are perturbed in individuals with MDD. However, a comprehensive evaluation of neurotransmitter levels in depression has not yet been performed.</p>"
"<p id=""Par4"">Brain tissues and cerebrospinal fluid are ideal biological samples for research on neuropsychiatric disorders<sup><a href=""#CR19"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR19"">19</a>,<a href=""#CR20"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR20"">20</a></sup>. However, brain tissue biopsy and lumbar puncture samples cannot be practically obtained from depressed patients because of ethical and safety concerns. In comparison, blood samples can be acquired at minimal risk and cost, and are commonly used in clinical laboratories<sup><a href=""#CR21"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR21"">21</a>,<a href=""#CR22"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR22"">22</a></sup>. Thus, a plasma-based diagnostic test for MDD would be clinically practical. In addition, peripheral metabolic disturbances have been found in MDD, suggesting that characteristic metabolic alterations associated with the pathogenesis of MDD may generate a detectable molecular phenotype in the blood for diagnosis<sup><a href=""#CR23"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR23"">23</a>,<a href=""#CR24"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR24"">24</a></sup>. Thus, plasma samples were used in the present study.</p>"
"<p id=""Par5"">Here, the applicability of a plasma-targeted metabonomic method for the diagnosis of MDD was evaluated. A total of 19 neurotransmitters and relevant metabolites were quantified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) coupled with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). This approach was used to distinguish 50 first-episode, antidepressant drug-naïve depressed patients from 50 healthy controls. This method can reliably detect metabolites involved in the GABAergic, catecholaminergic and serotonergic systems in plasma. We sought to characterize metabolite changes in the early stage of MDD with the aim of identifying potential diagnostic biomarkers for the disorder. In addition, an independent sample cohort, comprising 49 unselected MDD patients, 30 bipolar disorder (BD) patients, and 40 healthy controls, was used to validate the diagnostic performance of the biomarkers.</p>"
"<p id=""Par6"">The protocols of this study were reviewed and approved by the Ethical Committee of Chongqing Medical University. Prior to sample collection, written informed consent was acquired from all recruited subjects. All procedures were conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki.</p>"
"<p id=""Par7"">Totally, 99 MDD patients and 30 BD patients were recruited from the psychiatric center of the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University. All diagnoses were performed by two experienced psychiatrists according to the Structured Psychiatric Interview using DSM-IV-TR criteria as in our previous studies<sup><a href=""#CR5"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR5"">5</a>,<a href=""#CR25"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR25"">25</a></sup>. The MDD and BD subjects with pre-existing physical or other mental disorders, or illicit drug abuse, pregnancy, nursing, or menstruation for female subjects were excluded. The 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) was applied to assess the severity of MDD. During the same time period, 90 healthy controls were recruited from the same site and were required to have no current or previous lifetime history of neurological, DSM-IV Axis I/II diagnosis, systemic medical illness and family history of any psychiatric disorders.</p>"
"<p id=""Par8"">The recruited depressed patients and healthy controls were divided into two cohorts. In Cohort 1 (training set), relatively high homogeneous samples including 50 first-episode, antidepressant drug-naïve MDD subjects and 50 demographically matched healthy controls were used to identify candidate metabolite biomarkers for MDD. In Cohort 2 (testing set), 49 unselected MDD patients (11 unmedicated MDD samples and 38 medicated MDD samples) and 40 healthy controls were used to independently validate the diagnostic generalizability of the biomarkers. Moreover, 30 BD patients (11 unmedicated BD samples and 19 medicated BD samples) were recruited in Cohort 2 to assess the diagnostic specificity of the plasma metabolite biomarkers. There were two reasons accounting for this choice: (i) some clinical symptoms of BD overlapped with MDD and (ii) our previous studies had shown that BD were associated with disturbances of peripheral neurotransmitter metabolites.</p>"
"<p id=""Par9"">Sample preparation, and GC-MS and LC-MS/MS analysis were performed as our previous studies<sup><a href=""#CR25"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR25"">25</a>,<a href=""#CR26"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR26"">26</a></sup>. Briefly, plasma samples were extracted and analyzed on GC-MS and LC-MS/MS. For GC/MS, samples were analyzed on an Agilent 7890 A/5975 C Inert Triple Axis Detector (Agilent, USA). The original spectral data from GC−MS were converted to NetCDF format and then processed by XCMS software for peak finding, integration and alignment. LC-MS/MS analysis was employed to quantify low abundance neurotransmitters, using a Waters ACQUITY UPLC and AB Sciex Triple Quad6500 mass spectrometry system. Data collection and analysis for LC-MS/MS were performed using Analyst software (AB Sciex, v. 1.5.2) on the default parameters for automatic identification and integration of the MRM transition. The additional details information of targeted metabolomic analysis was shown in <a href=""#MOESM1"" class=""usa-link"">Supplemental Materials</a>.</p>"
"<p id=""Par10"">As clinical diagnosis based on the quantification of a small number of metabolites would be more practical, a binary logistic regression analysis was used to optimize the metabolite biomarker combination. To evaluate the diagnostic generalizability of the MDD biomarkers, the ability of the simplified biomarker panel to discriminate MDD subjects from non-MDD subjects was quantified using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.</p>"
"<p id=""Par11"">The chi-square test was used to analyze categorical data (sex). All continuous variables such as age, BMI and metabolite concentrations, were analyzed using Student’s two-tailed <em>t</em>-test or one-way ANOVA followed by the Bonferroni post hoc test. All continuous variables were expressed as means ± standard errors of the mean. All analyses were performed with MedCalc v. 15.2.1 (MedCalc Software, Mariakerke, Belgium). A <em>p</em>-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Heat maps of the metabolites were obtained using MetaboAnalyst 3.0 (<a href=""http://www.metaboanalyst.ca/"" class=""usa-link usa-link--external"" data-ga-action=""click_feat_suppl"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://www.metaboanalyst.ca/</a>)<sup><a href=""#CR27"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR27"">27</a></sup>.

"<p id=""Par12"">50 first-episode, antidepressant drug-naïve MDD subjects and 50 demographically matched healthy controls were divided into cohort 1 and used to identify candidate metabolite biomarkers for MDD. Medicated and unmedicated MDD and BD subjects were recruited in cohort 2 and were used to independently validate diagnostic generalizability of identified biomarkers, which paves the way for translating the identified biomarkers for clinical practice. All depressed patients scored higher on the HDRS than healthy controls in both cohort 1 and cohort 2. Demographic parameters such as age, gender and BMI did not differ among the groups in either cohort 1 or cohort 2. The key clinical characteristics of the recruited subjects were presented in Table <a href=""#Tab1"" class=""usa-link"">1</a>.</p>"

"<p id=""Par13"">Initially, to uncover how the three metabolic pathways changed in the early stage of MDD, levels of 19 nuermetabolites in first-episode, antidepressant drug-naïve MDD patients were compared with healthy controls. The neurometabolite concentration was obtained from the mass peak area of the sample analyte. Two-tailed Student’s <em>t</em>-test showed significant differences in plasma neurometabolites between the two groups (Table <a href=""#Tab2"" class=""usa-link"">2</a>, Fig. <a href=""#Fig1"" class=""usa-link"">1</a>). The analysis revealed that 9 of 18 plasma metabolites were significantly changed. Three metabolites—γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), tyramine (Tyra), and dopamine (DOPN)—were significantly increased in MDD subjects relative to healthy controls. Moreover, the levels of six metabolites—succinic acid (SA), α-ketoglutaric acid (a-KG), glutamine (Gln), L-tyrosine (L-Tyr), tryptophan (Trp), and kynurenine (Kyn)—were significantly decreased in MDD subjects relative to healthy controls</p>"

"<p id=""Par14"">To obtain a simple plasma metabolite biomarker panel that would be useful in diagnosing MDD in clinical practice, all key differential metabolites contributing to the discrimination between MDD subjects and healthy controls were used in univariate ROC curve analysis. The AUC of DOPN, GABA, Tyra, Gln, Trp, Kyn, SA, α-KG, L-Tyr, were 0.893, 0.887, 0.813, 0.771, 0.741, 0.685, 0.648, 0.637, 0.610, respectively. Among the nine neurometabolites, GABA showed the highest sensitivity (100% sensitivity), whereas the specificity was low. The sensitivity and specificity of the DOPN were 92 and 78%, respectively. The detail results of ROC curve analysis for each differential metabolite are shown in Supplemental Table <a href=""#MOESM1"" class=""usa-link"">3</a> and Supplemental Fig. <a href=""#MOESM1"" class=""usa-link"">1</a>.</p>"
"<p id=""Par15"">To investigate the relationship among the nine differential metabolites, their levels in the plasma samples from patients and healthy controls were evaluated using Spearman’s correlation (Fig. <a href=""#Fig2"" class=""usa-link"">2a</a>, Supplemental Fig. <a href=""#MOESM1"" class=""usa-link"">2</a>). A positive correlation is indicated with a blue color, whereas a negative correlation is indicated with a red color. Remarkably, the metabolites in the same pathway showed good correlations. Next, the nine differential metabolites were divided into three groups according to their function, and used to perform ROC analysis to identify the optimal plasma metabolite biomarker panel (Fig. <a href=""#Fig2"" class=""usa-link"">2b–d</a>). From the ROC curves, the calculated sensitivities and specificities of the three pathways in diagnosing MDD are shown in Fig. <a href=""#Fig2"" class=""usa-link"">2</a> and Supplemental Table <a href=""#MOESM1"" class=""usa-link"">4</a>.

"<p id=""Par18"">MDD is a complex, heterogeneous psychiatric disorder, partly attribute to secondary effects of illness chronicity and/or antipsychotic medication. Therefore, we chose first-episode, antidepressant drug-naïve to reduce the samples heterogeneity<sup><a href=""#CR29"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR29"">29</a></sup>. Presently, the diagnosis of MDD remains primarily subjective. Therefore, people who are depressed are often not correctly diagnosed, and others who do not have this disorder are too often misdiagnosed and prescribed antidepressants<sup><a href=""#CR30"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR30"">30</a>,<a href=""#CR31"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR31"">31</a></sup>.

The most prominent molecular endophenotypes and biomarkers of depression are neurotransmitters, including dopamine and GABA, and components of the serotonin pathway<sup><a href=""#CR35"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR35"">35</a>–<a href=""#CR37"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR37"">37</a></sup>. This is the first report to globally evaluate multiple neurotransmitters in the plasma of MDD patients, although changes in neurotransmitter levels have been implicated in many neuropsychiatric diseases. Our previous studies also found disturbance of some neurotransmitters in MDD animal models and patients<sup><a href=""#CR26"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR26"">26</a>,<a href=""#CR38"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR38"">38</a>–<a href=""#CR42"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR42"">42</a></sup>. Therefore, in the present study, metabolites involved in GABA, catecholamine and tryptophan metabolism in the plasma of depressed subjects and healthy controls were assessed by targeted metabolomics to identify those that are significantly differentially expressed in MDD subjects. Furthermore, the combination of GC-MS and LC-MS/MS used here can enhance detection and overcome their individual disadvantages.</p>"
"<p id=""Par20"">In clinical practice, BD cases are often misdiagnosed as MDD because of the similarity in clinical symptoms<sup><a href=""#CR43"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR43"">43</a></sup>. Recently, researchers have investigated the psychopathological characteristics of bipolar and unipolar depression<sup><a href=""#CR44"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR44"">44</a></sup> and found different pathophysiologic processes underlying the depressive episodes in MDD and BD, especially in the neural circuitry regulating emotion, reward and attention<sup><a href=""#CR45"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR45"">45</a></sup>. Our group previously identified candidate biomarkers for diagnosing MDD<sup><a href=""#CR11"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR11"">11</a>,<a href=""#CR12"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR12"">12</a>,<a href=""#CR46"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR46"">46</a>–<a href=""#CR49"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR49"">49</a></sup> and BD<sup><a href=""#CR50"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR50"">50</a>–<a href=""#CR53"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR53"">53</a></sup>, respectively. These biomarkers are capable of accurately distinguishing MDD and BD patients from healthy controls. However, it remained unknown whether these biomarkers can be used to differentiate MDD from BD. To address this issue, 30 BD subjects were also recruited in the current study to validate the diagnostic specificity of the biomarker panel. We found that this diagnostic panel could effectively discriminate the 49 MDD subjects from 30 BD subjects, with an AUC of 0.901 (95% confidence interval: 0.813–957).</p>"
"<p id=""Par21"">Here, we found that plasma GABA levels in MDD subjects were increased in cohorts 1 and 2. GABA is an inhibitory transmitter that has long been associated with mental illnesses, including anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia<sup><a href=""#CR54"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR54"">54</a>–<a href=""#CR56"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR56"">56</a></sup>. Studies of patients and animal models increasingly suggest a key role for functional imbalances between the major excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters, including GABA and its receptors<sup><a href=""#CR57"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR57"">57</a></sup>. Dysregulated GABA neurotransmission in MDD has been reported in the plasma, CSF and cortex of depressed subjects<sup><a href=""#CR58"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR58"">58</a>–<a href=""#CR60"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR60"">60</a></sup>. Consistent with our results, environmental factors, including stress and excessive alcohol use, may increase GABA, causing symptoms of depression or mania<sup><a href=""#CR61"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR61"">61</a></sup>. Indeed, the panel of biomarkers in the GABA pathway (SA, GABA, α-KG, and Gln) effectively discriminated MDD subjects from healthy controls, with an AUC of 0.904, suggesting that perturbations in GABAergic neurotransmission may be causal for depressive disorders.</p>"
"<p id=""Par22"">Many diseases such as depression, BD, Parkinson’s disease and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder are associated with abnormal catecholamine neurotransmitter levels. Kunugi et al.<sup><a href=""#CR62"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR62"">62</a></sup> proposed a subtype of depressed patients: a dopamine-related subset of patients who present with anhedonia and respond well to aripiprazole. Indeed, the presence of such subgroups might underlie the discrepancies between previous studies, and furthermore, they highlight the need for stratified treatment. Zhao et al.<sup><a href=""#CR63"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR63"">63</a></sup> reported that dopamine dysfunction in depressive patients might be a sign of diathetic depression or a depressive subtype, with medication unable to alter dopamine levels. In the present study, we systematically evaluated the plasma concentrations of dopamine and its metabolites, and found that plasma dopamine concentration was upregulated in depressed patients. This is in keeping with a previous report<sup><a href=""#CR64"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR64"">64</a></sup>, showing a marked increase in plasma and urinary norepinephrine in patients with major affective disorders, such as depression, bipolar depression, and unipolar depression. Furthermore, abnormal catecholaminergic neurotransmitters levels were detected in the prefrontal lobe of a depressed mouse model in our previous study<sup><a href=""#CR26"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR26"">26</a></sup>. Collectively, these findings suggest that plasma catecholamine neurotransmitters are comparatively reliable biological markers for MDD.</p>"
"<p id=""Par23"">We also found altered tryptophan metabolism in MDD subjects. Numerous studies suggest that brain serotonin plays a critical role in patients with depression, and the relationship between tryptophan metabolism intermediates and depression has recently been highlighted<sup><a href=""#CR65"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR65"">65</a>,<a href=""#CR66"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR66"">66</a></sup>. Several authors have described non-targeting metabolomics methods to determine the concentration of metabolites in the 5-HT and kynurenine pathways<sup><a href=""#CR67"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR67"">67</a>,<a href=""#CR68"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR68"">68</a></sup>. Here, we used a reliable targeted metabolomic method using GC-MS combined with LC-MS/MS to quantitate Trp, Kyn, 5-HT, 5-HIAA, 3-HA, NAS, and Tra. We found that the levels of Trp and Kyn were decreased in the plasma of first-episode, antidepressant drug-naïve depressed subjects compared with healthy controls. In line with this speculation, a recent study showed that plasma metabolites related to the kynurenine pathway are downregulated during high suicidal ideation<sup><a href=""#CR58"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR58"">58</a></sup>. However, in this study, the diagnostic efficacy of serotonergic pathway was not good as GABAergic and catecholaminergic pathway, suggesting that single peripheral serotonergic system could not discriminate MDD from healthy controls well. Serotonergic system combined with other neurotransmitters may performed better as a biomarker in diagnosis of MDD. The biomarker panel in this study, involving three pathways, can discriminate depressed patients from healthy controls and BD subjects with high accuracy.</p>"
"<p id=""Par24"">There are some limitations that should be noted in this study. First, the altered neurotransmitters identified in this study should be validated by metabolomic analysis of cerebrospinal fluid or brain tissues obtained from depressed patients. Second, as the MDD is a heterogeneous psychiatric disorder, we could not cover all the subtype. The subjects may not be very well described in clinical dimensions, although all the subjects were recruited with relatively strict criteria. Further studies using a larger sample size with more detailed clinical characteristics are required to validate the diagnostic performance. Lastly, all subjects were recruited from the same site; thus, site-specific biases cannot be ruled out. Further studies recruiting heterogeneous subjects from different clinical sites are required.</p>"
"<p id=""Par25"">In this study, using a GC-MS coupled with LC-MS/MS-based targeted metabolomics approach, we characterized changes in plasma neurotransmitter metabolites in the early stage of MDD, and identified a potential plasma diagnostic metabolite panel. This metabolite biomarker panel discriminates depressed patients from healthy controls and BD subjects with high accuracy. Our findings should contribute to uncovering the molecular pathogenesis of MDD, and they lay the foundation for the development of diagnostic and prognostic tests for the disorder.</p>"

"<p>Schizophrenia is the most severe and most debilitating mental illness, which is one of the first ten causes of disability in youth and elderly people. Regarding many consequences that schizophrenia brings for individual and social functioning of ill people, their assessment of the quality of their lives seems to be interesting. The aim of this study is to evaluate the incidence and severity of anxiety and depression as well as analysis of the impact level of anxiety and depression on life quality of people with schizophrenia. A group of patients with schizophrenia from psychiatric centers was involved in a study. A set of methods, included: author's questionnaire, the quality of life scale WHOQOL-BREF, and the hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS). Anxiety disorders occurred in more than 78% of respondents, while depressive disorders in more than half of respondents. The more severe anxiety and depressive disorders, the lower values were observed in all tested components of quality of life. The study of quality of life of the mentally ill patients should be conducted on a continuous basis in order to explore the current factors influencing the improvement of their psychophysical welfare. It is necessary to promote prohealthy mental lifestyle.</p>"
"<p>Schizophrenia is a chronic disease characterized by diverse and varied picture of the clinical course. It is undoubtedly the most serious and most debilitating mental illness, which is one of the first ten causes of disability among the young and the elderly. The risk over a lifetime reaches 1% regardless of geographical areas and cultural regions in the world. Usually it begins in adolescence or early adulthood and for most patients is lifelong. In the course of the disease all aspects of human functioning before illness are changing. The incidence is equal in both sexes, but men usually suffer at an earlier age, women in later life. In Poland, schizophrenia affects about 400 thousand people. In the province of Lublin in 2008, the number of patients with schizophrenia was 6674, and the number of newly registered cases of the disease was equal to 1225 [<a href=""#B1"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B1"">1</a>].</p>"
"<p>The fact of occurrence of chronic illness and the phenomenon of stigmatisation that is associated with the attitude of the society toward the mentally ill people often makes it impossible for them to start their own family. Among those remaining in the formal marriages or informal relationships the occurrence of the disease usually worsens the relationship with their spouse or partner, with children and other family members.</p>"
"<p>Their professional life is significantly distorted, their professional status is lowered. The patient is unable to perform their previous roles, their system of values is changed, and needs and life plans are also different. The patients start to break contact with other people, isolation, loss of interest, and emotional ties occur. The difficulties of patients are not limited to episodes of illness, but also concern the period between them.</p>"
"<p>In accordance with many consequences that schizophrenia brings for individual and social functioning of ill people, their assessment of quality of their lives seems to be interesting.</p>"
"<p>Systematic researches on the quality of life of patients began only in the eighties. Quality of life in medicine is important when developing new diagnostic and therapeutic methods. Researchers are constantly looking for methods more effective and safe in controlling the disease. Often, however, their use is associated with deterioration in quality of life of patients, it becomes a reason for giving up the treatment, which in turn is equal to its ineffectiveness. Initially, this type of analysis was carried out mainly in the field of oncology. Then researchers drew attention to the concept of quality of life also in other fields of medicine. Patients with chronic diseases like diabetes [<a href=""#B2"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B2"">2</a>] or epilepsy [<a href=""#B3"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B3"">3</a>] were tested.</p>"
"<p>In the case of the mentally ill patients, there were doubts whether the lack of access, presence of psychotic symptoms can affect the patient's assessment of their quality of life and whether that assessment is reliable [<a href=""#B4"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B4"">4</a>].</p>"
"<p>Despite all the doubts about the credibility and reliability of assessment of the quality of life conducted by patients themselves, for several years till now the subjective assessment of a patients with schizophrenia is taken increasingly into account and is considered to be the most important. It is fair to say that the assessment of quality of life of patients is one of the most important components of modern medical diagnosis and prognosis and allows for more targeted therapeutic intervention, expressing subjective approach to the patient, in order to meet their real needs.</p>"
<p>The main objective of the study was to assess the prevalence and severity of anxiety and depression as well as the impact analysis of level of anxiety and depression on quality of life of people with schizophrenia.</p>
"<p>Before we started the implementation of the present study, this research project was reported to the Bioethical Committee of the Medical University in Lublin. After receiving a positive review for the presented project of the clinical trial with the no. KE-0254/142/2008, we began to collect the research material.</p>"
"<p>In the study conducted from July 2009 to April 2010 the group of patients with schizophrenia from community psychiatric centres in Lublin province (Environmental Self-Help Homes, Charitable Society for Aid to the Sick “Misericordia"" and the Care and Educational Facility “Misericordia"", Daily department of the Neuropsychiatric Hospital in Lublin, Department of Psychiatric Rehabilitation at the Neuropsychiatric Hospital in Lublin and Occupational Therapy Workshops) was involved.</p>"
"<p>The criteria for inclusion of people with schizophrenia to the study were the following: written consent to participate in the study, diagnosis of schizophrenia according to ICD-10, age from 18 to 65 years, at least one hospitalization in the closed ward, no evidence of CNS damage, the lack of addictions, and contact with the family.</p>"
"<p>Among 180 distributed questionnaires, 122 were received. Manoeuvrability was 67.8%. 7 questionnaires were improperly filled by people with schizophrenia, and therefore they were excluded from the study. We analyzed 115 correctly completed questionnaires, consisting of a SET OF METHODS for patients with schizophrenia.</p>"
<p>A set of methods for people with schizophrenia consisted of five scales:</p>
"<p>author's questionnaire,</p>"
"<p>the quality of life scale, a standardized WHOQOL-BREF instrument,</p>"
"<p>anxiety and depression scale, a standardized HADS instrument (hospital anxiety and depression scale),</p>"
<p>author's questionnaire was developed for the patient based on knowledge and experience of the author and the available literature.</p>
"<p>WHOQOL-Bref scale is a research tool designed for the cognitive and clinical purposes. This scale is an international instrument to assess subjective quality of life. Bref version (the short one) WHOQOL was constructed on the basis of WHOQOL-100. The scale model is based on concepts developed by the WHO quality of life. It is used to measure satisfaction with life of people in the general population and in people suffering from various diseases. WHOQOL-Bref consists of 26 questions and allows to obtain the profile of the quality of life in four domains: physical, psychological, social relationships, and environmental.</p>"
"<p>The score reflects the areas of individual perceptions of quality of life in these areas. All questions are rated using a 5-point Likert scale. It is the scale of satisfactory reliability and validity, and its usefulness in studies of people with mental disorders has been documented by many works, both in Poland and in the world [<a href=""#B5"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B5"">5</a>].</p>"
"<p>Anxiety and depression scale, hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS), was constructed in 1983 by RP Zigmonda and Snaith [<a href=""#B6"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B6"">6</a>]. It consists of two separate subscales, one evaluates anxiety (HADS-A) and the second one depression (HADS-D). Each of the subscales contains 7 statements about the current state of the test person. Both subscales are counted and interpreted separately. For each question there are 4 variants of answers; each variant is indicated by a different numerical value (from 0 to 3). Counting is a simple summation of all values for the marked answers, separately for questions about anxiety, and separately for questions about depression. The anxiety scale measures the general anxiety, unfocused on a particular situation, and describes the mood of fear, anxiety, and lack of relaxation.</p>"
"<p>In the study group anxiety and depressive disorders were analyzed using the HADS scale. The average level of anxiety was 9.53 (SD = 3.63) and depression 7.58 (SD = 4.09) (<a href=""#fig1"" class=""usa-link"">Figure 1</a>).</p>"

<p>Anxiety and depressive disorders in tested patients with schizophrenia.</p>
"<p>Anxiety disorders were not observed in almost one in five people (21.74%). Mild anxiety disorders occurred in every second (43.48%), moderate in every fourth (25.22%), and severe in every tenth (9.57%) test person.</p>"
"<p>Depressive disorders were not observed in almost half (48.70%) of respondents. Mild depressive disorders occurred in every third (33.043%), moderate in every eighth (13.04%) test person, and severe in only six (5.22%) respondents.</p>"
<p>A correlation between the quality of life of tested patients with schizophrenia and the occurrence of anxiety and depression disorders in these patients was tested. In the study group we looked for correlations between the results in two general questions and areas of quality of life as well as anxiety and depression disorders.</p>
"<p>A strong negative correlation was observed between the severity of both anxiety disorders and depression and the values obtained in the overall perception of quality of life, in the general health situation as well as in all areas of quality of life, which means that the more severe anxiety and depressive disorders, the lower values observed in all tested components of quality of life (<a href=""#tab1"" class=""usa-link"">Table 1</a>).</p>"
"<p>The overall perception of quality of life of patients with schizophrenia, depending on the occurrence of anxiety and depressive disorders.</p>"
"<p>It is worth noting that the strongest correlations were observed between the level of anxiety and depressive disorders and psychological field (<a href=""#tab2"" class=""usa-link"">Table 2</a>). </p>"
"<p>The overall perception of the own health in patients with schizophrenia, depending on the occurrence of anxiety and depressive disorders.</p>"
"<p>Respondents in the case of severe anxiety or depression got the lowest scores in all areas of quality of life, while in those without any depressive disorder were observed the highest scores in all areas (<a href=""#tab3"" class=""usa-link"">Table 3</a>).</p>"
"<p> Particular areas of quality of life of patients with schizophrenia, depending on the prevalence of anxiety and depressive disorders.</p>"
"<p>It is assumed that depressive disorders occur in 60%–75% of people with schizophrenia. During the first episode and reactivation of psychosis the frequency rate of depressive disorders ranges from 65% to 80%, and during the remission period from 4% to 20% [<a href=""#B7"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B7"">7</a>].</p>"
"<p> All the studies published so far provide evidence that depression and anxiety are strong predictors of quality of life in schizophrenia [<a href=""#B8"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B8"">8</a>–<a href=""#B18"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B18"">18</a>].</p>"
"<p>As well as the impact of depression on quality of life of people with schizophrenia seems to be a stronger predictor than psychotic symptoms. Huppert et al. found that anxiety and depression measured by the scale of BPRS (brief psychiatric rating scale), independently of each other and of other symptoms of schizophrenia, correlate mostly with the subjective quality of life [<a href=""#B19"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B19"">19</a>].</p>"
"<p>Similar conclusions are reached by Bechdolf et al. in 2003 in their study on a group of 66 people with schizophrenia; in their case depression most strongly correlated with subjective quality of life of patients [<a href=""#B20"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B20"">20</a>].</p>"
"<p>The work of Górna et al. demonstrated that people with schizophrenia with accompanying depression received lower scores in two questions, both general and in all areas of quality of life measured by WHOQOL-Bref scale compared to those without depression. The largest disparity occurred in the field of psychology [<a href=""#B21"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B21"">21</a>].</p>"
"<p>In the the work in China from 2008 the level of depression measured using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale strongly negatively correlated with all domains of quality of life scale WHOQOL-Bref, anxiety measured using BPRS scale only with the field of psychology [<a href=""#B22"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B22"">22</a>]. Similar results were obtained by the author in his earlier work from 2007. Anxiety and depression strongly correlated with overall quality of life and with all areas of WHOQOL-Bref scale.</p>"
"<p>Researchers from Portugal in 2008 came to similar conclusions: the level of depression as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale strongly negatively correlated with the field of psychological and physical scale WHOQOL-Bref [<a href=""#B23"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B23"">23</a>].</p>"
"<p>Additionally, it also appears that those patients with concomitant depression are more aware of the consequences of their disease and treatment efficacy. Depressive symptoms can occur as a consequence of the realization of loss, humiliation, shame, and an expression of blame because of their mental state.</p>"
"<p>Similar conclusions are presented in this work. Correlations between the severity of anxiety disorders and depression and the values obtained in the overall perception of quality of life, in the general health condition as well as in all areas of quality of life, were pointed out which means that the more severe anxiety and depressive disorders, the lower values were observed in all tested components of quality of life. It is worth noting that the strongest correlations were observed between the level of anxiety and depressive disorders and psychological field including elements of the subscales: appearance, negative feelings, positive feelings, self-esteem, spirituality/religion/personal faith, and thinking/learning/memory/concentration.</p>"
<p>The study of quality of life of the mentally ill people should be conducted on a continuous basis in order to explore the current factors influencing the improvement of their mental and physical welfare. This should be valuable information for managers of medical institutions and medical personnel.</p>
"<p>Moderate and severe anxiety disorders occurred among 34.79% of people with schizophrenia, while moderate and severe depressive disorders in 18.26% of people with schizophrenia. These individuals require consultation with a psychologist or psychiatrist and consideration of implementation of appropriate pharmacological or psychotherapeutic interactions. Efforts should be made to compensate these disorders, because the more severe anxiety and depressive disorders, the worse the values observed in all areas of quality of life.</p>"
"<p>It is necessary to promote prohealthy mental lifestyle and encourage participation in the preventive activities in mental illness, particularly in the eastern region of Poland.</p>"
<p>The quality of life of people with schizophrenia and their families is one of the major subjects that are currently being considered in both theory and practice. The need to ensure the quality of life results from the fact that life and human health are the highest value.</p>

"<p id=""P1"">Depression is well known to share a negative cross-sectional relationship with personality constructs defined by positive emotion (positive affect, extraversion, behavioral activation). These Positive Emotionality (PE) constructs have been proposed to represent stable temperamental risk factors for depression, not merely current mood state. These constructs have also been proposed to increase risk specifically for depression, relative to anxiety. We performed a meta-analysis of longitudinal studies to examine the relationship of PE to depression (59 effect sizes) and anxiety (26 effect sizes). In cross-sectional analyses, PE constructs were negatively associated with depression (<em>r</em> = −.34) and anxiety (<em>r</em> = −.24). PE constructs also prospectively predicted depression (<em>r</em> = −.26) and anxiety (<em>r</em> = −.19). These relationships remained statistically significant, but were markedly attenuated, when baseline levels of depression (β = −.08) and anxiety (β = −.06) were controlled. Moreover, depression and anxiety were equally strong predictors of subsequent changes in PE (β = −.07 and −.09, respectively). These findings are consistent with theoretical accounts of low PE as a temperamental vulnerability for depression, but suggest that the prospective relationship of PE to depression may be weaker and less specific than previously assumed.</p>"

"<p id=""P2"">Major depressive disorder is one of the most common mental disorders in the U.S. (<a href=""#R99"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R99"">Kessler, Chiu, Demler, Merikangas, &amp; Walters, 2005</a>) and among the most burdensome diseases in the world (<a href=""#R192"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R192"">World Health Organization, 2002</a>). A core symptom of depression is anhedonia, a lack of interest or pleasure in usual activities (<a href=""#R3"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R3"">American Psychiatric Association, 2013</a>). Many depressed individuals exhibit a diminished tendency to experience positive emotions, even in the presence of normally appetitive stimuli (<a href=""#R11"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R11"">Berenbaum &amp; Oltmanns, 1992</a>; <a href=""#R95"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R95"">Kaviani et al., 2004</a>; <a href=""#R101"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R101"">D.

This contrasts with the experience of individuals high in Positive Emotionality (PE), who exhibit elevations in positive mood states such as happiness, interest, energy, and confidence (<a href=""#R126"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R126"">Mineka, Watson, &amp; Clark, 1998</a>; <a href=""#R183"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R183"">Watson &amp; Naragon-Gainey, 2010</a>, <a href=""#R184"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R184"">2014</a>). In fact, PE is generally regarded not only as a marker of psychological health (<a href=""#R67"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R67"">Gilbert, 2012</a>; <a href=""#R135"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R135"">Ozer &amp; Benet-Martinez, 2006</a>; <a href=""#R171"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R171"">Tugade &amp; Fredrickson, 2004</a>; though see <a href=""#R69"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R69"">Gruber, Johnson, Oveis, &amp; Keltner, 2008</a>) but as an evolutionarily adaptive trait that increases psychological flexibility and strengthens physical, intellectual, and social resources (<a href=""#R61"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R61"">Fredrickson, 1998</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P3"">Several prominent theoretical models suggest that, in addition to reflecting current mood state, PE is a stable and heritable personality trait (<a href=""#R107"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R107"">Krueger, McGue, &amp; Iacono, 2001</a>) that, at low levels, increases risk for depression and exacerbates the course of the disorder (<a href=""#R26"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R26"">Clark, 2005</a>; <a href=""#R28"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R28"">Clark &amp; Watson, 1991</a>, <a href=""#R29"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R29"">1999</a>; <a href=""#R35"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R35"">Davidson, 1998</a>; <a href=""#R39"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R39"">Depue &amp; Iacono, 1989</a>; <a href=""#R68"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R68"">Gray, 1994</a>; <a href=""#R185"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R185"">Watson, Stasik, Ellickson-Larew, &amp; Stanton, 2015</a>). For example, theories concerning the closely related behavioral activation and inhibition systems (<a href=""#R68"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R68"">Gray, 1994</a>), approach and withdrawal systems (<a href=""#R35"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R35"">Davidson, 1998</a>), and behavioral facilitation systems (<a href=""#R39"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R39"">Depue &amp; Iacono, 1989</a>; <a href=""#R59"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R59"">Fowles, 1994</a>) all posit a causal role for low PE in depression. Broadly, these biobehavioral theories describe an approach system that controls goal-directed behavior, is activated in response to positive stimuli, and generates positive emotional experiences. Depression is thought to result from an underactive approach system (<a href=""#R155"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R155"">Shankman &amp; Klein, 2003</a>). Similarly, the influential tripartite model (<a href=""#R28"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R28"">Clark &amp; Watson, 1991</a>), later reformulated into the integrative hierarchical (<a href=""#R126"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R126"">Mineka et al., 1998</a>) and quadripartite (<a href=""#R179"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R179"">Watson, 2009</a>) models, identifies low PE as a core component and potential risk factor for depression (<a href=""#R30"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R30"">Clark, Watson, &amp; Mineka, 1994</a>). Unlike negative emotionality, which is viewed as a factor common to depression and anxiety, PE is thought to relate more specifically to depression. Although PE has also been associated with social phobia and agoraphobia (<a href=""#R12"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R12"">Bienvenu &amp; Stein, 2003</a>; <a href=""#R94"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R94"">Kashdan, 2007</a>), it is generally more strongly and consistently correlated with measures of depression than anxiety (<a href=""#R179"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R179"">Watson, 2009</a>). The PE personality trait in the Five-Factor Model, extraversion, is also theorized to constitute a risk factor for the development of depression (<a href=""#R30"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R30"">Clark et al., 1994</a>; <a href=""#R120"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R120"">McCrae &amp; Costa, 1987</a>; <a href=""#R187"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R187"">Watson, Wiese, Vaidya, &amp; Tellegen, 1999</a>). Importantly, although PE is labeled differently in different theories, PE constructs are conceptually similar and correlations among them are high.<sup><a href=""#FN2"" class=""usa-link"">1</a></sup></p>"
"<p id=""P4"">Spurred in part by these models, numerous studies have investigated the relationship of PE to depression, with research efforts increasing sharply in recent years (<a href=""#R132"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R132"">Naragon-Gainey, Watson, &amp; Markon, 2009</a>; <a href=""#R191"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R191"">Proceedings, 2011</a>; <a href=""#R181"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R181"">Watson, Clark, &amp; Stasik, 2011</a>; <a href=""#R182"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R182"">Watson, Gamez, &amp; Simms, 2005</a>; <a href=""#R185"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R185"">Watson et al., 2015</a>). Many, though not all, of these studies have provided evidence for a cross-sectional relationship, paralleling experimental evidence for attenuated reactivity to positive stimuli in depression across self-report, behavioral, physiological, and neural measures (<a href=""#R20"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R20"">Bylsma, Morris, &amp; Rottenberg, 2008</a>; <a href=""#R43"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R43"">Dichter, 2010</a>; <a href=""#R44"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R44"">Dichter, Damiano, &amp; Allen, 2012</a>; <a href=""#R46"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R46"">Dillon et al., 2014</a>). Building on these findings, two meta-analyses have directly examined the cross-sectional relationship between PE (restricted to extraversion) and depression. One meta-analysis found that while mental disorders as a group were associated with low PE, mood disorders were associated with significantly lower PE than all other disorders (<a href=""#R117"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R117"">Malouff, Thorsteinsson, &amp; Schutte, 2005</a>). The second meta-analysis found that PE was most strongly associated with dysthymic disorder (a chronic form of depression) and social phobia (<a href=""#R104"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R104"">Kotov, Gamez, Schmidt, &amp; Watson, 2010</a>). Unexpectedly, PE shared weak associations with major depression and relatively strong associations with other anxiety disorders. This surprising pattern may have resulted from the presence of comorbid disorders in the diagnostic groups that were studied (<a href=""#R130"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R130"">Naragon-Gainey, Gallagher, &amp; Brown, 2013</a>), although it leaves open the possibility that low PE may be less specific to depression than has previously been suggested.</p>"
"<p id=""P5"">These cross-sectional studies, though informative, have been unable to test the fundamental assertion that PE increases vulnerability to depression. Demonstrating that low PE precedes and predicts subsequent increases in depression is essential for establishing PE as a risk factor, rather than an epiphenomenon or a consequence, of depression (<a href=""#R105"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R105"">Kraemer et al., 1997</a>). Characterizing the temporal association between PE and depression is also important for adjudicating among explanations for their relationship. Explanations that have been proposed for the relationship between personality traits and psychopathology include: (a) the predisposition model, which posits that personality influences the development of psychopathology; (b) the pathoplasty model, which posits that personality affects the course of psychopathology; (c) the scar model, which asserts that psychopathology leads to permanent changes in personality; and (d) the complication model, which asserts that psychopathology leads to temporary changes in personality that last until the disorder remits (<a href=""#R30"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R30"">Clark et al., 1994</a>; <a href=""#R104"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R104"">Kotov et al., 2010</a>). Discovering that PE prospectively predicts depression would lend support to the predisposition and pathoplasty models, whereas evidence that depression predicts PE would provide support for the scar and complication models. While these pathways are not mutually exclusive, the degree to which PE predicts depression versus the reverse can shed light on the relative applicability of these explanatory models to the PE-depression relationship.</p>"
"<p id=""P6"">In line with views of PE as a vulnerability factor, some longitudinal studies have found that low PE predicts later heightened levels of depression (e.g., <a href=""#R64"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R64"">Geerts &amp; Bouhuys, 1998</a>; <a href=""#R93"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R93"">Kasch, Rottenberg, Arnow, &amp; Gotlib, 2002</a>; <a href=""#R130"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R130"">Naragon-Gainey et al., 2013</a>). Further support comes from studies showing that initial levels of anhedonia predict increased odds of depression two years later (<a href=""#R178"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R178"">Wardenaar, Giltay, van Veen, Zitman, &amp; Penninx, 2012</a>) and a more chronic course of the disorder over ten years (<a href=""#R128"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R128"">Moos &amp; Cronkite, 1999</a>). In adolescents, diminished seeking of positive stimuli has been found to predict later depressive symptoms (<a href=""#R58"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R58"">Forbes, Shaw, &amp; Dahl, 2007</a>; <a href=""#R143"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R143"">Rawal, Collishaw, Thapar, &amp; Rice, 2013</a>). Similarly, heightened reactivity to positive stimuli has been found to predict recovery from depression in adults (<a href=""#R151"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R151"">Rottenberg, Kasch, Gross, &amp; Gotlib, 2002</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P7"">Not all studies have found that PE predicts subsequent levels of depression, however (e.g., <a href=""#R17"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R17"">Brown, 2007</a>; <a href=""#R189"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R189"">Weiss et al., 2009</a>). These conflicting accounts mirror the findings from family and twin studies, which do not consistently identify PE as a risk factor for depression (<a href=""#R102"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R102"">D. N. Klein, Kotov, &amp; Bufferd, 2011</a>). Several narrative reviews have evaluated the longitudinal relationship between PE and depression and have come to different conclusions, suggesting that PE probably does predict depression (<a href=""#R30"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R30"">Clark et al., 1994</a>; <a href=""#R129"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R129"">Morris, Bylsma, &amp; Rottenberg, 2009</a>; <a href=""#R183"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R183"">Watson &amp; Naragon-Gainey, 2010</a>), probably does not (<a href=""#R155"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R155"">Shankman &amp; Klein, 2003</a>), or that results are inconclusive (<a href=""#R52"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R52"">Enns &amp; Cox, 1997</a>). These conclusions are complicated by the fact that few longitudinal studies have tested whether PE predicts <em>change</em> in depression by controlling for initial depression symptoms. Controlling for initial symptoms is critical to ensure that prospective effects of PE are not due to the cross-sectional relationship between PE and depression and the stability of depression over time (<a href=""#R55"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R55"">Finkel, 1995</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P8"">The present study is the first to examine the longitudinal relationship between PE and depression using meta-analysis, thereby overcoming several important limitations of past reviews (<a href=""#R150"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R150"">Rosenthal &amp; DiMatteo, 2001</a>). Meta-analysis does not rely on each study’s report of statistical significance to determine the presence of a relationship, pools studies together to overcome the problem of low statistical power that is common in psychopathology research, and quantifies effect sizes to determine the strength of relationships. Importantly, the technique used in the present meta-analysis also allows for the control of initial symptom levels regardless of whether the study itself controlled for this factor (<a href=""#R161"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R161"">Sowislo &amp; Orth, 2013</a>), thereby providing a more rigorous test of PE as a risk factor for depression.</p>"
"<p id=""P9"">According to extant theoretical models, PE is a risk factor for depression in particular (<a href=""#R75"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R75"">Hasler, Drevets, Manji, &amp; Charney, 2004</a>). This suggests that PE should exhibit stronger and more consistent relationships with depression than with other emotional disorders (i.e., anxiety disorders; <a href=""#R126"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R126"">Mineka et al., 1998</a>; <a href=""#R183"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R183"">Watson &amp; Naragon-Gainey, 2010</a>; <a href=""#R185"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R185"">Watson et al., 2015</a>). In fact, low PE is one of very few risk factors that are thought to distinguish depression from anxiety (see <a href=""#R153"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R153"">Ruscio &amp; Khazanov, 2016</a>, for a review). The specificity of low PE to depression, however, has been examined only in cross-sectional meta-analyses (<a href=""#R104"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R104"">Kotov et al., 2010</a>; <a href=""#R117"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R117"">Malouff et al., 2005</a>), whose conflicting results have been described above. Previous narrative reviews of this topic have been similarly inconclusive (<a href=""#R30"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R30"">Clark et al., 1994</a>; <a href=""#R155"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R155"">Shankman &amp; Klein, 2003</a>; <a href=""#R183"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R183"">Watson &amp; Naragon-Gainey, 2010</a>). To address this gap, the present study examined PE as a risk factor for anxiety as well as depression. We focused on general (rather than syndromal) measures of anxiety because we wanted to test the claim that PE is more strongly associated with depression than with anxiety conceptualized in general terms (<a href=""#R183"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R183"">Watson &amp; Naragon-Gainey, 2010</a>), and because there were not enough studies examining the longitudinal relationships between PE and specific anxiety syndromes (e.g., panic, social anxiety) to include in our analysis.<sup><a href=""#FN3"" class=""usa-link"">2</a></sup></p>"
"<p id=""P10"">Gaining a better understanding of the relation of PE to depression and anxiety may help reduce the steep societal and personal costs of these conditions. If PE is indeed a risk factor for depression, low PE levels could be used to identify vulnerable individuals for prevention efforts before the onset of depression (<a href=""#R104"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R104"">Kotov et al., 2010</a>). Targeting prevention interventions toward individuals at high risk for depression is crucial to limit the cost and increase the feasibility of these interventions (<a href=""#R159"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R159"">Smit, Beekman, Cuijpers, de Graaf, &amp; Vollebergh, 2004</a>). Furthermore, PE measures could be included in initial clinical assessments to recommend treatment strategies that target this particular vulnerability (e.g., behavioral activation; <a href=""#R79"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R79"">Hopko, Lejuez, Ruggiero, &amp; Eifert, 2003</a>) or to provide therapists with information helpful for other aspects of treatment planning, such as promoting a strong therapeutic alliance and compliance with homework assignments (<a href=""#R195"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R195"">Zinbarg, Uliaszek, &amp; Adler, 2008</a>). Patient outcomes could improve if treatment choices were made based on characteristics that predict treatment response (<a href=""#R41"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R41"">DeRubeis et al., 2014</a>), and personality traits have been found to predict response to particular types of treatments (<a href=""#R157"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R157"">Simon &amp; Perlis, 2010</a>). Evidence that PE is a specific risk factor for depression relative to anxiety would allow for more precise predictions regarding the onset and course of particular symptoms, further enhancing prevention and treatment efforts.</p>"
"<p id=""P11"">By contrast, evidence that PE increases risk similarly for depression and anxiety would prompt reevaluation of its scope as a vulnerability factor and reformulation of its role in emotional disturbance. For example, a lack of specificity could suggest that PE, like negative emotionality (<a href=""#R110"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R110"">Lahey, 2009</a>; <a href=""#R126"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R126"">Mineka et al., 1998</a>), contributes to the close relationship and frequent co-occurrence of depression with anxiety. Similarly, evidence that PE follows, as well as precedes, depression would challenge the unidirectional causal pathway that is widely assumed in the literature (e.g., <a href=""#R18"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R18"">Brown &amp; Barlow, 2009</a>; <a href=""#R26"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R26"">Clark, 2005</a>). Bidirectional effects would have implications not only for etiological models of depression, but for the broader debate over the nature of the relationship between personality and psychopathology (<a href=""#R1"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R1"">Akiskal, Hirschfeld, &amp; Yerevanian, 1983</a>; <a href=""#R30"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R30"">Clark et al., 1994</a>; <a href=""#R108"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R108"">Krueger &amp; Tackett, 2003</a>). These findings would call into question the conceptualization of personality traits as primarily contributing to, rather than influenced by, the development of clinical disorders (<a href=""#R26"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R26"">Clark, 2005</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P12"">The present meta-analysis sought to establish whether PE is a specific risk factor for depression. To answer this question, four goals were pursued. The first goal was to examine three effect sizes quantifying the relationship between PE and depression: the cross-sectional relationship; the longitudinal relationship between PE and depression; and the longitudinal relationship between PE and depression, controlling for initial symptoms of depression. The longitudinal, controlled relationship was considered the most rigorous test of PE as a risk factor for depression. However, examining all three relationships allowed us to compare the meta-analytic results with patterns observed in previous research, much of which has focused on cross-sectional and uncontrolled relationships.</p>"
"<p id=""P13"">The second goal was to investigate whether depression predicts PE. To do this, we examined the longitudinal relationship between depression and PE, with and without controls for initial levels of PE. Together with the earlier tests of PE predicting depression, these analyses allowed us to compare the extent of support for the scar/complication models versus the predisposition/pathoplasty models.</p>"
"<p id=""P14"">The third goal was to evaluate the specificity of PE as a predictor and outcome of depression. This goal was pursued by recalculating the effect sizes described above for the relationship between PE and anxiety. We compared the effect sizes to determine whether the influence of PE is limited to depression or extends to other forms of emotional disturbance.</p>"
"<p id=""P15"">As the relationships of PE with depression and anxiety have been studied over widely varying time intervals, we recalculated the longitudinal, controlled relationships for relatively short (up to one year) and long (more than one year) inter-assessment intervals. These analyses allowed us to examine the magnitude and stability of the primary effect sizes across more homogenous time lags. They also allowed us to check that effect sizes were not disproportionally affected by studies with very long time lags.</p>"
"<p id=""P16"">The fourth goal was to examine moderators that may explain variability in the relationship between PE and depression. Given our primary interest in the longitudinal relationship between PE and depression, controlling for initial depression levels, we examined moderators of this relationship. Previous research prompted us to include several categories of potential moderators: the operationalization of PE, characteristics of the sample, and features of the study measures.</p>"
"<p id=""P17"">While the constructs of positive affect, extraversion, and behavioral activation are generally grouped under the umbrella of PE, these constructs might differ in the magnitude of their association with depression. Specifically, positive affect may relate more strongly to depression than the broader construct of extraversion, which includes elements of sociability, ascendance, and fun seeking in addition to positive affect (<a href=""#R131"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R131"">Naragon-Gainey &amp; Watson, 2014</a>; <a href=""#R132"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R132"">Naragon-Gainey et al., 2009</a>; <a href=""#R185"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R185"">Watson et al., 2015</a>). Behavioral activation has also been suggested to relate more strongly to depression than extraversion (<a href=""#R155"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R155"">Shankman &amp; Klein, 2003</a>). To explore potential differences in the magnitude of these relationships, the type of PE construct was examined as a moderator.</p>"
"<p id=""P18"">Additionally, the time span covered by the PE measure might influence the strength of its relationship to depression (<a href=""#R180"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R180"">Watson &amp; Clark, 1994</a>). PE measures can be administered with state instructions (i.e., asking respondents to rate PE over a particular span of time) or trait instructions (i.e., asking respondents to rate their general levels of PE). Whereas state measures may relate more strongly to current ratings of psychopathology (<a href=""#R180"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R180"">Watson &amp; Clark, 1994</a>), trait measures may predict future depression more strongly (<a href=""#R17"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R17"">Brown, 2007</a>). We therefore examined state versus trait instructions of PE measures as a moderator.</p>"
"<p id=""P19"">Some, but not all, studies have suggested that the relationship between PE and depression may differ by age. Specifically, PE may be less consistently related to depression in children and adolescents than in adults (for a review, see <a href=""#R38"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R38"">De Bolle &amp; De Fruyt, 2010</a>). To examine this possibility more closely, we evaluated sample age as a moderator. Although few studies have investigated sex differences in the relationship between PE and depression, indications that this relationship may be stronger for males than females (<a href=""#R149"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R149"">Rorsman, Grasbeck, Hagnell, Isberg, &amp; Otterbeck, 1993</a>) prompted us to test sex as a moderator as well.</p>"
"<p id=""P20"">Given past reviews that have documented stronger relationships between personality characteristics and mental disorders in clinical than nonclinical samples (<a href=""#R94"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R94"">Kashdan, 2007</a>; <a href=""#R104"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R104"">Kotov et al., 2010</a>; <a href=""#R152"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R152"">Ruiz, Pincus, &amp; Schinka, 2008</a>), we examined sample type as a moderator. To understand more fully how sample characteristics influence the relationship of PE to depression, we also examined the following sample characteristics as moderators: whether study eligibility criteria (e.g., including only individuals with major depression) likely yielded a restricted range of symptom levels, whether the sample experienced a defined event between assessments (e.g., loss of a loved one, medical treatment) that would be expected to produce change in symptom levels, and whether the sample consisted of a special population (e.g., individuals with a physical illness) that differed from the general population in important ways.</p>"
"<p id=""P21"">Past studies generally have not found differences in the PE-depression relationship based on the type of reporter (e.g., self-report versus clinician-report; <a href=""#R185"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R185"">Watson et al., 2015</a>). However, as discrepancies between self- and other-reports are not uncommon in research on psychopathology (<a href=""#R48"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R48"">Dozier &amp; Lee, 1995</a>), we examined type of reporter as a moderator. Also, as continuous disorder measures are generally more stable and reliable than dichotomous measures (<a href=""#R24"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R24"">Chmielewski, Clark, Bagby, &amp; Watson, 2015</a>; <a href=""#R179"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R179"">Watson, 2009</a>), we examined whether the type of depression measure moderated the relationship between PE and depression.</p>"
"<p id=""P22"">We hypothesized that PE would be related to depression in cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses and would predict depression even when initial symptoms were controlled. We further hypothesized that PE would predict depression to a greater extent than depression would predict PE, thereby obtaining stronger support for the predisposition and pathoplasty models than for the scar and complication models. In line with extant theoretical models, we hypothesized that PE would serve as a specific risk factor for depression, as evidenced by a stronger prospective, controlled relationship between PE and depression than between PE and anxiety. We also expected that PE’s prospective, controlled relationships with both depression and anxiety would be stronger over shorter time intervals. Finally, based on previous research, we expected the PE-depression relationship to be moderated by type of PE construct assessed, state versus trait measurement of PE, sample age, and sample type (clinical versus nonclinical).</p>"
"<p id=""P23"">Relevant studies were identified through a search on PsycINFO and Medline databases through November, 2014 using combinations of the keywords (1) positive affect*, positive emotion*, behavioral activation, BAS, extr*version, and reward dependence, paired with (2) depress*, dysthym*, dysphor*, anx*, phob*, fear, panic, post traumatic stress disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, PTSD, acute stress disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, OCD, GAD, and schizo*, and (3) longitudinal, risk factor, vulnerability, prospective, retrospective, and antecedent. The asterisk allowed for the inclusion of alternate word endings. For example, anx* resulted in articles containing anxiety, anxious, and so forth. In an effort to reduce publication bias (the “file drawer problem”), no restrictions were placed on publication type. Eight doctoral dissertations and one conference paper met our eligibility criteria and were included in the analyses. Additionally, the reference sections of all eligible papers, including papers without sufficient effect size data for which authors were contacted, were hand-searched for relevant studies.

"<p id=""P24"">The following eligibility criteria were applied to select studies for the meta-analysis:</p>"
"<p id=""P25"">The study design was longitudinal and included measures of PE and depression/anxiety at one time-point and at least one of these measures at the following time-point (to allow for the control of symptoms or PE levels at baseline). Given these restrictions, retrospective studies with only one assessment occasion were excluded. Studies using ecological momentary assessment (EMA) were excluded unless the study also included a long-term followup (e.g., if a study measured PE using EMA at Time 1 and depression at Time 1 and Time 2, this study was eligible for inclusion). Due to difficulties with correlated data points in twin studies (<a href=""#R22"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R22"">Carlin, Gurrin, Sterne, Morley, &amp; Dwyer, 2005</a>), these types of studies were excluded. Finally, only reports in English were included.</p>"
"<p id=""P26"">Eligible PE measures included measures of positive affect, positive emotionality, behavioral activation, and extraversion. Given variability in the content of positive emotionality measures, these measures (<em>n</em> = 5) were categorized as positive affect measures if they focused exclusively on positive affect, and as extraversion measures if they also assessed sociability.</p>"
"<p id=""P27"">As stated previously, we included measures that used either state or trait instructions. To ensure that measures of PE reflected participants’ report of their natural state over a period of at least a few days, studies with instructions to rate PE “in the present moment” were excluded, as were studies using a measure of PE to assess changes in mood state following an experimental manipulation. EMA studies utilizing momentary assessments of PE that compiled these ratings over a period of at least a few days were included.</p>"
"<p id=""P28"">Symptom measures were required to include an assessment of symptoms of depression or anxiety. Measures of depressed affect that did not include assessment of other symptoms of depression were excluded. Anxiety measures focusing on fear (e.g., Beck Anxiety Inventory; <a href=""#R8"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R8"">Beck &amp; Steer, 1993</a>) and anxiety (e.g., State-Trait Anxiety Inventory; <a href=""#R162"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R162"">Spielberger, 1989</a>) were included. As noted, only measures assessing general levels of anxiety were included. Measures assessing specific anxiety disorders (e.g., social anxiety disorder) or anxiety in particular situations (e.g., test anxiety) were excluded. Measures were also required to assess depression and anxiety as separate constructs. Measures assessing “internalizing symptoms” or “emotional disorders” were excluded. Both continuous and dichotomous symptom measures were included.</p>"
"<p id=""P29"">Self-report measures and measures rated by others (i.e., expert clinical interviewers, trained lay interviewers, parents) were included. Behavioral measures were excluded. Single measures assessing multiple constructs of interest (e.g., positive affect and depression measured on the same scale, as in the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale; <a href=""#R142"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R142"">Radloff, 1977</a>) were included if there was no content overlap.</p>"
"<p id=""P30"">All types of populations were included, except those for whom there were concerns about measurement validity due to potential cognitive impairment. Therefore, studies focusing on patients with dementia, stroke, multiple sclerosis, or traumatic brain injury were excluded. Participants who were bereaved, serving as caregivers, or currently or previously physically ill were included and identified as special populations. Given differences between participants with unipolar and bipolar depression on measures of PE in previous research (<a href=""#R184"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R184"">Watson &amp; Naragon-Gainey, 2014</a>; <a href=""#R185"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R185"">Watson et al., 2015</a>) and our focus on unipolar depression, samples including participants with bipolar disorder were excluded.</p>"
"<p id=""P31"">Samples experiencing a defined life event between assessments (e.g., loss of a loved one, military deployment, birth of a child) were included. Treatment studies of medical treatments were included. Treatment studies of psychological or psychiatric treatments were excluded. If a study was not a psychological treatment study, but a portion of participants likely received treatment (i.e., studies recruiting from outpatient clinics), the study was included. Follow-up studies in which the first assessment took place after receipt of treatment were included. These criteria allowed us to be as inclusive as possible, while restricting the analyses to studies that tracked the progression of depression/anxiety without direct attempts to change symptom levels.</p>"
"<p id=""P32"">To ensure independence of effect sizes, when multiple papers presented data from the same study, one paper was selected for inclusion based on the following criteria (in order of importance): 1) if one paper presented data on both depression and anxiety and another presented data on only one of these constructs, the paper with more information was selected; 2) the paper with the most complete data to calculate effect sizes was selected; 3) the paper that most directly addressed the present research question was selected; and 4) the most recently published paper was selected.</p>"
"<p id=""P33"">Authors of studies providing the majority of data needed to calculate effect sizes (i.e., only one correlation was missing) were contacted. Additionally, authors of studies including PE and depression/anxiety as central constructs, but not including the data necessary to calculate effect sizes, were contacted. Authors of studies that did not provide the majority of data needed to calculate effect sizes and that did not include PE and depression/anxiety as central constructs were not contacted.</p>"
"<p id=""P34"">When authors were contacted, all relevant measures included in the paper were requested. As the majority of eligible studies used continuous symptom measures, and as continuous effect sizes were used in the present analysis, continuous symptom measures were requested (e.g., a self-report measure or a measure of the number of symptoms endorsed in a clinical interview). As the majority of eligible studies used self-report measures, self-report measures were requested. These requests were intended to minimize the heterogeneity between studies. When the paper presented data from up to three time points, data from all time points were requested. When the paper presented data from four or more time points (<em>k</em> = 10), three time points were requested: the baseline assessment, the time point closest to one year after baseline, and the time point closest to five years after baseline. This strategy allowed us to conduct additional analyses examining effect sizes for studies with more homogeneous time points.</p>"
"<p id=""P35"">All authors were requested to send effect size data for the same sample of participants for all time points. This ensured that all effect size calculations were based on the same sample of participants. When eligible studies providing all data necessary for calculating effect sizes included data on different samples (i.e., baseline correlations included more participants than prospective correlations), authors were contacted and requested to send data for equivalent samples. Of 23 eligible studies, seven included data on different samples. The authors of these seven studies were contacted and revised data were sent for two papers. Of the remaining five papers, three provided data for samples that differed in size by less than 20% and the papers specified that no differences were found between these samples on measures of interest (PE and depression/anxiety measures). We conducted sensitivity analyses with the remaining two studies (<a href=""#R118"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R118"">Marques et al., 2011</a>; <a href=""#R139"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R139"">Poon &amp; Knight, 2013</a>). As effect sizes were essentially unchanged whether these studies were included or excluded, analyses are reported with these studies included. For all studies, the percent of attrition from the first assessment to the assessment used for analyses was included as a moderator.</p>"
"<p id=""P36"">Our literature search led to the identification of 1,564 papers (see <a href=""#F1"" class=""usa-link"">Figure 1</a> for schematic). Titles and abstracts were reviewed by the first author and a trained research assistant, and the full texts of all papers marked as potentially relevant by either reviewer (<em>k</em> = 869) were examined.</p>"

"<p id=""P37"">Of these papers, 23 met the eligibility criteria listed above and included all the information necessary to calculate effect sizes. Another 152 papers met the eligibility criteria, but did not include enough information to calculate effect sizes. Of these 152 papers, the authors of 66 papers were contacted based on the contact criteria listed above. Corresponding authors were contacted three times using up-to-date contact information found online or obtained from university administrators, coauthors, and former advisors. Data were obtained for 41 papers. Therefore, 64 papers were included in the analyses, with one paper providing effect sizes for two separate samples of participants (<a href=""#R111"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R111"">Langer, Weisman, Rodebaugh, Binder, &amp; Lenze, 2014</a>). As some articles (<em>k</em> = 20) provided effect sizes for both depression and anxiety, these 65 separate samples provided 59 effect sizes for depression and 26 effect sizes for anxiety.</p>"
"<p id=""P38"">As noted, we calculated three effect sizes for each set of analyses: (1) the cross-sectional correlation between the two variables (e.g., the correlation of PE at Time 1 with depression at Time 1); (2) the prospective correlation between the predictor variable and the outcome variable (e.g., the correlation of PE at Time 1 with depression at Time 2); and (3) the cross-lagged regression between the predictor variable and the outcome variable, controlling for prior levels of the outcome variable (e.g., the correlation of PE at Time 1 with depression at Time 2, controlling for depression at Time 1). These effect sizes were calculated for four sets of analyses estimating the relationships between (1) PE at Time 1 and depression at Time 2; (2) depression at Time 1 and PE at Time 2; (3) PE at Time 1 and anxiety at Time 2; (4) anxiety at Time 1 and PE at Time 2.</p>"
"<p id=""P39"">Cross-lagged regressions were calculated for the third (controlled) effect size using zero-order correlations between variables in the following equation (<a href=""#R32"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R32"">Cohen, Cohen, West, &amp; Aiken, 2003</a>):
</p>"
"<p>β<sub><em>Y</em>1.2</sub> is the standardized regression coefficient of <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> predicting <em>Y</em>, adjusting for the effect of <em>X</em><sub>2</sub> (e.g., the effect of PE at Time 1 on depression at Time 2, adjusting for depression at Time 1). The correlation between the predictor variable of interest [<em>X</em><sub>1</sub>] and the outcome variable [<em>Y</em>] is <em>r</em><sub><em>Y</em>1</sub> (e.g., the correlation of PE at Time 1 with depression at Time 2). The correlation between the other predictor variable [<em>X</em><sub>2</sub>] and the outcome variable [<em>Y</em>] is <em>r</em><sub><em>Y</em>2</sub> (e.g., the correlation of depression at Time 1 with depression at Time 2). The baseline correlation between the two predictors [<em>X</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>X</em><sub>2</sub>] is <em>r</em><sub>12</sub> (e.g., the correlation of PE at Time 1 with depression at Time 1).</p>"
"<p id=""P40"">We used cross-lagged regressions, rather than cross-lagged correlations (e.g., comparing the correlation between PE at Time 1 and depression at Time 2 with the correlation between depression at Time 1 and PE at Time 2), because of criticisms that the latter are confounded by the stability of the outcome variable (<a href=""#R114"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R114"">Locascio, 1982</a>; <a href=""#R148"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R148"">Rogosa, 1980</a>; <a href=""#R161"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R161"">Sowislo &amp; Orth, 2013</a>). For example, a large cross-lagged correlation between PE and depression may merely reflect the high stability of depression from Time 1 to Time 2 if PE and depression are strongly correlated at Time 1. Cross-lagged regressions avoid this confound by controlling for the stability of the outcome variable.</p>"
"<p id=""P41"">Studies were coded for effect sizes and moderators using a formal coding manual. The first author coded all studies and an advanced graduate student coded a random subset of 30 studies. Interrater reliability was calculated for effect sizes and continuous moderators using intraclass correlation coefficients and for categorical moderators using Cohen’s kappa. Interrater agreement was high (ICC ≥ .99 and κ ≥ .91 for continuous and categorical variables, respectively) and discrepant ratings were discussed until consensus was reached.</p>"
"<p id=""P42"">When multiple symptom measures were available in one study, we coded the continuous measure and the self-report measure (PE measures were always continuous and self-report). These decisions were made to reduce the heterogeneity between studies, as the majority of symptom measures were continuous and self-report. Additionally, continuous measures were privileged because effect sizes were continuous. On the other hand, when only dichotomous measures were available, they were included to avoid systematically biasing the sample by excluding studies in which major depression was measured via clinician diagnoses.</p>"
"<p id=""P43"">When more than one continuous, self-report depression or anxiety measure was available (<em>k</em> = 5), the effect sizes based on these measures were averaged for analysis. By contrast, we decided against combining multiple PE measures because we were interested in the moderating effect of PE constructs (positive affect vs. extraversion vs. behavioral activation) on the relationship of PE to depression and anxiety. In other words, combining a measure of extraversion with a measure of positive affect would have prevented us from examining differences between these constructs across studies. Instead, for studies in which more than one PE measure was available (<em>k</em> = 4), we chose the measure that had the strongest cross-sectional relationship with depression or anxiety at Time 1. This enabled us to represent the strongest available relationship between PE and symptoms, without basing selection on the primary effect size of interest (i.e., the prospective, controlled relationship). Sensitivity analyses using the weakest available relationship between PE and symptoms resulted in effect sizes that were essentially unchanged.</p>"
"<p id=""P44"">For prospective analyses, the effect size for the shortest time lag in each study was coded. Additionally, we grouped the cross-lagged effect sizes into two categories for separate analyses: (1) time lags up to and including one year and (2) time lags over one year. These categories were not mutually exclusive; studies reporting data for more than one time lag (<em>k</em> = 14), of which one was up to a year and one was over a year, were included in both groups. We chose this method of examining time lags because it allowed us to evaluate the stability of cross-lagged effect sizes across more homogenous intervals and to utilize multiple effect sizes from individual studies where available.</p>"
"<p id=""P45"">For each effect size, the following moderators were coded:</p>"
"<p id=""P46"">We coded the type of PE construct (positive affect, extraversion, or behavioral activation) and whether the measure used state instructions (i.e., asked participants to rate their PE over a particular span of time) or trait instructions (i.e., asked participants to rate their general levels of PE). All measures with state instructions asked participants to rate PE within the past year or less.</p>"
"<p id=""P47"">As this meta-analysis utilized longitudinal data with varying time lags, it was not possible to code participants’ exact age. Instead, the sample was coded as child/adolescent or adult, as few studies differentiated between children and adolescents.</p>"
"<p id=""P48"">As the proportion of male and female participants differed at different time lags and precise demographic information was not available for data requested from authors, we coded studies whose sample consisted primarily (over 70%) of one sex. Only one study in the depression analysis was predominantly male, whereas 15 studies were predominantly female. We therefore examined the use of a predominantly female sample as a moderator.</p>"
"<p id=""P49"">We coded sample type, including clinical samples (recruited from mental health inpatient or outpatient settings), physical health samples (recruited from physical health inpatient or outpatient settings), students, and community/representative samples. We tested clinical status as a moderator by examining differences (1) between clinical samples and all other samples, and (2) between clinical and physical health samples and all other samples.</p>"
"<p id=""P50"">To examine whether studies with a restricted range of symptom levels differed from other studies, we coded whether the study (1) included only participants with depression or anxiety, or (2) excluded participants with baseline symptoms of depression.</p>"
"<p id=""P51"">Samples that experienced a defined life event between assessments (e.g., loss of a loved one, military deployment, birth of a child), received medical treatment, or had a high probability of receiving psychological treatment were coded as such. As these were all samples in which change between assessments was more likely than in other samples, they were examined together as one moderator.</p>"
"<p id=""P52"">Finally, we coded whether the sample consisted of a special population, including participants who were bereaved, caretakers of others, or selected on the basis of a current or former physical illness.</p>"
"<p id=""P53"">We distinguished studies in which all measures were self-reported from studies in which the depression measure was other-reported (PE measures were always self-reported). We also distinguished studies in which all measures were continuous from studies in which the depression measure was originally dichotomous and presented continuously by request (i.e., symptom count from a clinical interview). No dichotomous depression measures were included in the sample of studies examined for moderators.</p>"
"<p id=""P54"">The following indicators of study quality were coded: study location (study conducted in the U.S. or Western Europe versus anywhere else), sample size, year of publication, total number of study waves (not only those for which effect size data were available), and percent of attrition in the study sample from the first assessment to the assessment used for analyses. To ensure that there were no systematic differences between studies that included all the necessary data to calculate effect sizes in the report versus studies that required author contact, we included this variable as a moderator as well.</p>"
"<p id=""P55"">Effect size and moderation analyses were conducted using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis version 3.3.070 (<a href=""#R15"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R15"">Borenstein, Hedges, Higgins, &amp; Rothstein, 2014</a>). As correlational effect sizes have problematic standard error formulations in their standard form (<a href=""#R2"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R2"">Alexander, Scozzaro, &amp; Borodkin, 1989</a>), all effect sizes were transformed using Fisher’s <em>Z<sub>r</sub></em>-transform (<a href=""#R76"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R76"">Hedges &amp; Olkin, 1985</a>), defined as:
</p>"
"<p>where <em>r</em> is the reported correlation, log<em><sub>e</sub></em> is the natural logarithm, and ES<em><sub>Zr</sub></em> is the Fisher’s <em>Z<sub>r</sub></em>-transformed correlation.</p>"
"<p id=""P56"">As recommended by <a href=""#R76"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R76"">Hedges and Olkin (1985)</a>, each effect size was weighted by the inverse of its within-study variance plus the between-studies variance (tau-squared). The within-study variance (w<sub>zr</sub>) was calculated using the following formula for Fisher’s <em>Z<sub>r</sub></em>-transformed correlation coefficients: 
</p>"
"<p>where <em>n</em> is the sample size. This weighting procedure gives greater weight to larger samples than smaller samples (<a href=""#R113"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R113"">Lipsey &amp; Wilson, 2001</a>). For ease of interpretation, Fisher’s <em>Z<sub>r</sub></em>-transformed correlations were transformed back into the standard correlational form for the presentation of results. Following two previous meta-analyses utilizing cross-lagged regression coefficients as effect sizes (<a href=""#R109"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R109"">Kuykendall, Tay, &amp; Ng, 2015</a>; <a href=""#R161"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R161"">Sowislo &amp; Orth, 2013</a>), cross-lagged effect sizes were also transformed using Fisher’s <em>Z<sub>r</sub></em>-transform and weighted as described above. According to current guidelines (<a href=""#R14"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R14"">Borenstein, Hedges, Higgins, &amp; Rothstein, 2009</a>), all analyses were conducted using a random effects model, with the “method of moments” utilized to estimate between-study variance.</p>"
"<p id=""P57"">We compared corresponding effect sizes across depression and anxiety using robust variance estimation (<a href=""#R77"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R77"">Hedges, Tipton, &amp; Johnson, 2010</a>), implemented in the statistical program R (version 3.1.1) with the “robumeta” package. This technique, utilized in numerous meta-analyses (<a href=""#R40"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R40"">De Vibe, Bjørndal, Tipton, Hammerstrøm, &amp; Kowalski, 2012</a>; <a href=""#R134"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R134"">Oswald, Mitchell, Blanton, Jaccard, &amp; Tetlock, 2013</a>; <a href=""#R167"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R167"">Tanner-Smith, Wilson, &amp; Lipsey, 2013</a>), permits comparison of effect sizes across studies in which multiple, dependent effect sizes are drawn from the same sample. We used this method as some studies (<em>k</em> = 20) provided effect sizes for both depression and anxiety. The method requires a parameter estimate for the correlation between dependent effect sizes. Given typically high correlations between measures of depression and anxiety (<a href=""#R153"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R153"">Ruscio &amp; Khazanov, 2016</a>), we initially set ρ =.7; however, sensitivity analyses recommended by the developers revealed that results remained the same across all values of ρ (0–1).</p>"
"<p id=""P58"">For each effect size, the sample-adjusted meta-analytic deviance (SAMD) statistic was calculated to test for the presence of statistical outliers (<a href=""#R82"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R82"">Huffcutt &amp; Arthur, 1995</a>). The SAMD statistic values approximate a normal <em>t</em> distribution. A more conservative cutoff score of 2.58 was used to consider studies for exclusion in order to avoid removing outliers whose effects represented true population variability, as extreme values can result from true population variability or error (<a href=""#R7"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R7"">Beal, Corey, &amp; Dunlap, 2002</a>). The SAMDs were rank-ordered and the scree plots examined. When an effect size’s SAMD value was greater than 2.58, but the scree plot indicated that it was continuous with the overall distribution, the study was retained. Only effect sizes that were clearly discontinuous with the overall distribution and that had SAMD values over 2.58 were excluded.</p>"
"<p id=""P59"">Heterogeneity among effect sizes was examined using both τ<sup>2</sup> (an estimate of between-study variance) and the I<sup>2</sup> statistic. The I<sup>2</sup> index quantifies the degree of heterogeneity by describing the percentage of the variance attributable to between-study variance. I<sup>2</sup> values of 25%, 50%, and 75% indicate low, moderate, and high heterogeneity, respectively (<a href=""#R78"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R78"">Higgins &amp; Thompson, 2002</a>). As the I<sup>2</sup> index is influenced by sample size and can be biased in meta-analyses with small samples (<a href=""#R177"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R177"">von Hippel, 2015</a>), we included confidence intervals for each effect size as well.</p>"
"<p id=""P60"">Categorical moderators were tested using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) of mixed-effects models. Continuous moderators were tested using unrestricted maximum likelihood meta-regression. Given the large number of moderators tested, significant moderators were included in a single regression to test the predictive power of each, controlling for the effects of the others.</p>"
"<p id=""P61"">In order to reduce publication bias, we included unpublished dissertations and acquired effect size data from authors. Additionally, we tested for the presence of publication bias in several ways. First, we visually inspected a funnel plot, which plots the standard error for each study (determined by the study’s sample size) against the study’s effect size (Fisher’s <em>Z</em>). In the absence of publication bias, the plot approximates a funnel shape, with large studies that provide a more reliable estimate of effect size clustered around the mean toward the top of the plot, and smaller studies that provide more variables estimates of effect size scattered more widely around the mean toward the bottom of the plot. In the presence of publication bias, the bottom of the plot appears asymmetrical. As the effect sizes in this analysis were expected to be negative, a pattern of more studies below than above the mean effect size would be the most likely indication of publication bias.</p>"
"<p id=""P62"">We also used <a href=""#R51"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R51"">Duval and Tweedie’s (2000)</a> trim-and-fill procedure to calculate the likely number of missing studies based on asymmetry in the funnel plot and to compute effect sizes adjusting for these missing studies. Additionally, we calculated the classic fail-safe <em>N</em> to determine the number of missing studies that would bring the <em>p</em> value above .05.</p>"
"<p id=""P63"">While the funnel plot and its associated tests are well-established methods of evaluating publication bias, these procedures rely on the assumption of homogeneity of effect sizes (<a href=""#R168"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R168"">Terrin, Schmid, Lau, &amp; Olkin, 2003</a>). As we expected to find heterogeneity among effect sizes, we also tested for publication bias by using publication type as a moderator, examining whether effect sizes reported in published studies differed significantly from effect sizes reported in unpublished studies (i.e., dissertations and the conference paper).</p>"
"<p id=""P64"">Studies providing data for PE and depression (<em>k</em> = 59; see <a href=""#T1"" class=""usa-link"">Table 1</a>) were published between 1994 and 2014, with a median publication year of 2010.

Of the 26 studies that assessed anxiety, six used measures that primarily (over 75% of items) assessed fear (e.g., racing heart), and three used measures that primarily assessed anxious distress (e.g., feeling worried or upset).

"<p id=""P67"">The two main analyses evaluating the cross-lagged effect of PE at Time 1 on depression or anxiety at Time 2 showed no evidence of publication bias.

This test indicated that 1,370 studies and 190 studies would be required to reduce to nonsignificance the relationships of PE with depression and anxiety, respectively. Lastly, we evaluated publication type as a moderator of the relationships of PE with depression and anxiety.

"<p id=""P68""><a href=""#T3"" class=""usa-link"">Table 3</a> displays the weighted mean effect sizes for the relationship of PE with depression. Consistent with our hypotheses, PE was related to depression in cross-sectional (<em>r</em> = −.34) and prospective, uncontrolled (<em>r</em> = −.26) analyses. These moderate effects diminished to a far smaller, though still reliable, association (−.08) in cross-lagged analyses that controlled for initial depression symptoms. Contrary to our hypotheses, depression predicted changes in PE to the same extent as PE predicted changes in depression: The uncontrolled (−.28 and −.26, respectively) and controlled (−.07 and −.08) effect sizes were nearly identical in both directions.<sup><a href=""#FN4"" class=""usa-link"">3</a></sup></p>"
"<p id=""P69""><a href=""#T4"" class=""usa-link"">Table 4</a> displays parallel effect sizes for the relationship of PE with anxiety. In a pattern very similar to depression, PE was related to anxiety in cross-sectional (<em>r</em> = −.24) and prospective, uncontrolled (<em>r</em> = −.19) analyses. Controlling for initial anxiety symptoms diminished the cross-lagged relationship between PE and anxiety to −.06.<sup><a href=""#FN5"" class=""usa-link"">4</a></sup> Importantly, none of the three effect sizes (cross-sectional, uncontrolled prospective, or controlled prospective) were significantly larger for depression than for anxiety, all <em>β</em> &lt; −.074, all <em>p</em> &gt; .10, based on robust variance estimation.<sup><a href=""#FN6"" class=""usa-link"">5</a></sup> Additionally, the bidirectional paths observed between PE and depression were also evident for anxiety: Anxiety predicted, and was predicted by, PE to a very similar degree in both uncontrolled (−.19 and −.23, respectively) and controlled (−.06 and −.09, respectively) analyses.</p>"
"<p id=""P70"">To examine the stability of the cross-lagged effects across different time lags, we recalculated the effects separately for inter-assessment intervals (a) up to and including one year and (b) more than one year, using the effect size closest to the time lag of interest (one year or five years). The prospective, controlled relationships between PE and depression were remarkably stable, regardless of the time frame that separated the assessments. Across all studies, the relationship (95% CI in brackets) between PE at Time 1 and depression at Time 2 was −.08 ([−.09, −.06], <em>k</em> = 58, <em>Mdn</em> time lag = 6.5 months). For studies with intervals up to one year, the effect size was −.08 ([−.10, −.06], <em>k</em> = 48, <em>Mdn</em> = 12 months) and for studies with intervals over one year, the effect size was −.08 ([−.10, −.05], <em>k</em> = 24, <em>Mdn</em> = 36 months). The relationship was equally stable in the opposite direction: Across all studies, the relationship between depression at Time 1 and PE at Time 2 was −.07 ([−.09, −.04], <em>k</em> = 33, <em>Mdn</em> = 6 months). For studies with intervals up to one year, the effect size was −.06 ([−.09, −.03, <em>k</em> = 27, <em>Mdn</em> = 12 months) and for studies with intervals over one year, the effect size was −.08 ([−.13, −.04], <em>k</em> = 15, <em>Mdn</em> = 36 months).</p>"
"<p id=""P71"">The prospective, controlled relationships between PE and anxiety were also quite stable over time, although results should be interpreted with caution given the small number of effect sizes available for some analyses. Across all studies, the relationship between PE at Time 1 and anxiety at Time 2 was −.06 ([−.09, −.04], <em>k</em> = 26, <em>Mdn</em> time lag = 6 months). For studies with intervals up to one year, the effect size was −.05 ([−.09, −.02], <em>k</em> = 20, <em>Mdn</em> = 6 months) and for studies with intervals over one year, the effect size was −.08 ([−.10, −.05], <em>k</em> = 11, <em>Mdn</em> = 38 months). Reversing the direction, the relationship between anxiety at Time 1 and PE at Time 2 was −.09 ([−.11, −.06], <em>k</em> = 15, <em>Mdn</em> = 5 months). For studies with intervals up to one year, the effect size was, −.04 ([−.07, −.002], <em>k</em> = 12, <em>Mdn</em> = 5 months) and for studies with intervals over one year, the effect size was −.13 ([−.19, −.08], <em>k</em> = 7, <em>Mdn</em> = 42 months).</p>"
"<p id=""P72"">We tested moderators of the main relationship of interest: the cross-lagged relationship between PE at Time 1 and depression at T2. The amount of heterogeneity in this effect size estimate was small (28%), hinting that moderation effects were likely to be modest.</p>"
"<p id=""P73"">Consistent with this account, only two variables emerged as significant moderators of the cross-lagged relationship between PE and depression (see <a href=""#T5"" class=""usa-link"">Table 5</a>). The first was sample age: The link between PE and depression was stronger for adults (β = −.09 [−.11, −.07], <em>p</em> &lt; .001, <em>k</em> = 42) than for children and adolescents (β = −.04 [−.07, −.01], <em>p</em> =.005, <em>k</em> = 15), <em>Q</em>(1) = 8.45, <em>p</em> = .004.<sup><a href=""#FN7"" class=""usa-link"">6</a></sup></p>"
<p>Moderation Analyses for the Cross-lagged Regression Between PE at Time 1 and Depression at Time 2</p>

"<p class=""display-inline"">Analysis excluded one study that did not include enough information for coding moderators or did not fall into one of the moderator categories. Additional information can be found in <a href=""#SD1"" class=""usa-link"">Supplementary Table 1</a>.</p>"
"<p class=""display-inline""><em>p</em> &lt; .01. No <em>p</em> values were &lt; .05.</p>"
"<p id=""P74"">The second significant moderator was having an experience between assessments that posed a high likelihood of symptom change. Samples comprising individuals who experienced a defined life event, medical treatment, or the possibility of psychological treatment yielded larger effect sizes (β = −.11 [−.14, −.08], <em>p</em> &lt; .001, <em>k</em> = 17) compared to other samples (β = −.06 [−.08, −.04], <em>p</em> &lt; .001, <em>k</em> = 41), <em>Q</em>(1) = 8.46, <em>p</em> = .004. Separate follow-up analyses found each type of inter-assessment change to be associated with a larger effect size compared to all other studies. These differences, however, were only statistically reliable when all types of change were analyzed together. Interestingly, the moderating effect of defined life events was similar whether the event was negative (e.g., military deployment) or positive (e.g., graduating from high school), <em>Q</em>(2) = 4.10, <em>p</em> = .129.</p>"
"<p id=""P75"">We found no difference in the relationship between PE and depression depending on the operationalization of PE. This was the case even though we increased our power to detect a difference by increasing the number of behavioral activation effect sizes from 2 (in our main depression analyses) to 6, substituting a behavioral activation effect size for the 4 other studies that provided one (starred in <a href=""#T1"" class=""usa-link"">Table 1</a>). Similarly, moderation analyses revealed no significant differences by sample characteristics other than age, by study measures, or by any of the indicators of study quality evaluated. Importantly, effect sizes did not differ depending on whether data were published or requested from authors, supporting the decision to analyze them together.</p>"
"<p id=""P76"">As sample age and inter-assessment change both emerged as significant moderators, we included them together in a single regression analysis predicting the magnitude of the cross-lagged relationship between PE and depression. Each moderator remained statistically significant when levels of the other moderator were controlled, <em>Q</em>(2) = 18.15, <em>p</em> &lt; .001. The two moderators accounted for roughly equal proportions of the variance in the effect size, with slight changes depending on the order in which they were entered into the regression. Together, they accounted for 83% of the variance in the prospective, controlled relationship between PE and depression, leaving no unexplained heterogeneity, <em>Q</em>(54) = 57.53, <em>p</em> = .346; I<sup>2</sup> for the final model = 6.14%. That is, the model with these two predictors accounted for 83% of the unexplained variance (τ<sup>2</sup>) in the model without these predictors.</p>"
"<p id=""P77"">In a series of meta-analyses, we quantified the cross-sectional, prospective, and cross-lagged relationships between PE and depression and evaluated their specificity vis-à-vis anxiety. PE shared a moderate cross-sectional relationship and a small to moderate prospective relationship with depression. The prospective relationship was markedly attenuated, however, once initial levels of depression were controlled. Furthermore, PE predicted change in depression to the same extent that depression predicted change in PE. Finally, PE predicted change in depression to the same extent that it predicted change in anxiety. These results were consistent across shorter (up to one year) and longer (more than one year) assessment intervals and across differing operationalizations of PE. The PE-depression relationship was stronger for adults than for children and adolescents, and stronger for samples with a high probability of inter-assessment symptom change than for other samples. Despite these differences, in all samples lower levels of PE reliably, but weakly, predicted subsequent increases in depression.</p>"
"<p id=""P78"">The moderate cross-sectional relationship observed here between PE and depression (<em>r</em> = −.34) was similar to the continuous effect sizes reported in a recent meta-analysis (<em>r</em> = −.25 to −.29, depending on type of depressive disorder; <a href=""#R104"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R104"">Kotov et al., 2010</a>). Building on these results, we found that the prospective relationship of PE to depression was also robust (<em>r</em> = −.26). Demonstrating the temporal precedence of PE is an important precondition for establishing vulnerability, but it is not sufficient, given the cross-sectional relationship between PE and depression and the persistence of depression over time. In our sample of studies, for example, the correlation between depression at Time 1 and Time 2 was .56 (<em>k</em> = 57, 95% CI [.53, .59], τ<sup>2</sup> = 0.02).</p>"
"<p id=""P79"">We undertook a more rigorous test of the vulnerability hypothesis by controlling for initial levels of depression, even when the original study did not include this control. That PE remained a significant predictor in this conservative analysis provides the most compelling psychometric evidence to date for its status as a risk factor for depression. At the same time, the large reduction in effect size that occurred when baseline symptoms were controlled suggests that the risk conferred by low PE may be much smaller than has previously been suggested. In addition, our finding that the cross-lagged relationship of PE to depression was nearly identical to the cross-lagged relationship of depression to PE suggests that PE is as likely to be a consequence as a cause of depression.</p>"
"<p id=""P80"">What might account for the departure of our findings from extant theories of PE and depression? There are several possible explanations. First, it is rare in psychopathology for a single risk factor to have large and specific effects (<a href=""#R33"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R33"">Coie et al., 1993</a>). This does not preclude the possibility that more potent risk factors than PE exist, and future research should be directed in part toward identifying the strongest predictors of depression. Nevertheless, comprehensive models will almost certainly need to consider multiple risk factors and their interactions in order to powerfully predict symptom change (<a href=""#R102"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R102"">D. N. Klein et al., 2011</a>; <a href=""#R106"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R106"">Kraemer, Stice, Kazdin, Offord, &amp; Kupfer, 2001</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P81"">Second, it is possible that the constructs of PE and depression are overly broad and that stronger cross-lagged relationships exist between specific aspects of these constructs (<a href=""#R102"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R102"">D. N. Klein et al., 2011</a>; <a href=""#R183"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R183"">Watson &amp; Naragon-Gainey, 2010</a>). Although we did not find stronger associations of depression with the narrower construct of positive affect than with the broader construct of extraversion, positive affect is itself composed of several facets that may relate differentially to depression. For example, the positive affect facet of Joviality is associated more strongly with depression than are Self-Assurance and Attentiveness (<a href=""#R164"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R164"">Stanton &amp; Watson, 2014</a>), and the positive emotion of pride is associated more strongly with depression than are happiness and amusement (<a href=""#R70"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R70"">Gruber, Oveis, Keltner, &amp; Johnson, 2011</a>). Additionally, we focused on global levels of PE and not on PE responses to specific stimuli, which can be divided into emotional responses during anticipation, reaction, and recall of a stimulus (<a href=""#R67"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R67"">Gilbert, 2012</a>). Preliminary evidence that depression relates more strongly to some phases of positive emotional responding (e.g., anticipation) than others (e.g., reaction; <a href=""#R63"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R63"">D. Gard, M. Gard, Kring, &amp; John, 2006</a>) highlights the importance of examining each temporal aspect of PE separately. Similarly, heterogeneity in the expressed features, pathophysiology, and etiology of depression (<a href=""#R127"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R127"">Monroe &amp; Anderson, 2015</a>) limits the power of any individual risk factor to predict change in depression over time. Given this heterogeneity, progress may be accelerated by investigating associations of PE with more homogenous subsets of depression symptoms. This approach is supported by evidence that some depression symptoms (anhedonia, depressed mood, worthlessness, and lassitude) are more strongly related to PE than others (motor, sleep, and appetite disturbance; <a href=""#R183"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R183"">Watson &amp; Naragon-Gainey, 2010</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P82"">Third, it is possible that behavioral measures of PE will be revealed to predict depression more powerfully than the self-report measures investigated here. Behavioral PE measures include tasks evaluating reward learning, effort exertion for rewards, and facial expressions in response to pleasant stimuli (<a href=""#R138"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R138"">Pizzagalli, Iosifescu, Hallett, Ratner, &amp; Fava, 2008</a>; <a href=""#R151"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R151"">Rottenberg et al., 2002</a>; <a href=""#R169"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R169"">Treadway, Buckholtz, Schwartzman, Lambert, &amp; Zald, 2009</a>). While several studies have found that behavioral measures of PE prospectively predict depression (<a href=""#R137"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R137"">Pizzagalli, 2014</a>; <a href=""#R151"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R151"">Rottenberg et al., 2002</a>), substantial differences between these measures and uncertainty over their relationship to self-reported PE (<a href=""#R57"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R57"">Forbes &amp; Dahl, 2005</a>; <a href=""#R137"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R137"">Pizzagalli, 2014</a>) impede a meaningful quantitative synthesis across studies. In addition, behavioral measures of PE might be expected to yield smaller effect sizes than self-report measures, simply because the latter share method variance with self-reported depression symptoms. That said, behavioral measures deserve more attention in view of advantages they offer over global self-report measures. In particular, they map more directly onto dimensions of reward processing that are disrupted in depression (<a href=""#R40"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R40"">Der-Avakian &amp; Markou, 2012</a>), such as motivation for, engagement with, and learning from positive stimuli (<a href=""#R191"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R191"">Proceedings, 2011</a>; <a href=""#R170"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R170"">Treadway &amp; Zald, 2011</a>). These dimensions are conceptually very similar to PE, and clarifying their relationship to PE would help bridge the burgeoning literature on reward processing with the vast literatures on normal personality and emotion. In doing so, behavioral measures could help illuminate behavioral and neurobiological mechanisms linking PE to psychopathology.</p>"
"<p id=""P83"">Fourth, prospective relationships between PE and depression may have been weakened by effects of current mood on PE levels. Although we controlled for <em>initial</em> symptoms of depression, we were unable to rule out the possibility that <em>concurrent</em> symptoms of depression biased participants’ reports of PE (<a href=""#R27"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R27"">Clark, Vittengl, Kraft, &amp; Jarrett, 2003</a>). With the use of repeated assessments, a recent study applied a statistical method for isolating the influence of time-invariant (as opposed to transient, mood-state-dependent) aspects of personality traits on disorder symptoms (<a href=""#R130"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R130"">Naragon-Gainey et al., 2013</a>). Isolating the time-invariant component of PE enhanced its ability to predict the longitudinal course of depression. Another study using this method found that the time-invariant component of PE also predicted the first onset of depressive disorders (<a href=""#R96"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R96"">Kendall et al., 2015</a>). These results suggest that state variance may dilute the association of PE with depression, especially in samples with high levels of depression whose responses are influenced by extreme mood states. Our moderation analyses found no evidence of a weaker cross-lagged relationship between PE and depression for clinical relative to nonclinical samples, or for depressed/anxious samples relative to all other samples. However, we could not ascertain whether mood state was more variable and led to more extreme changes in PE depending on mood in clinical than nonclinical participants. It therefore remains possible that the influence of current mood state on reports of PE weakened PE’s ability to predict depression.</p>"
"<p id=""P84"">The acknowledgment that PE has both trait and state components could help explain the discrepancy between our findings of the nonspecificity of PE and the many cross-sectional studies showing relative specificity of PE to depression vis-à-vis anxiety (<a href=""#R30"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R30"">Clark et al., 1994</a>; <a href=""#R117"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R117"">Malouff et al., 2005</a>; <a href=""#R126"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R126"">Mineka et al., 1998</a>; <a href=""#R182"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R182"">Watson et al., 2005</a>). As depression, unlike anxiety, includes symptoms reflecting low PE, it is possible that the state component of PE inflates its cross-sectional association with depression relative to anxiety. In longitudinal studies in which PE and symptoms are assessed months or even years apart, the influence of this state component on symptom reports is reduced.</p>"
"<p id=""P85"">Perhaps the most striking departure from existing theories was not the magnitude of the observed effects, but their remarkable similarity in both temporal directions. Our results showed clearly that PE is as likely to be an outcome of depression (consistent with the scar and complication models) as a vulnerability factor (consistent with the predisposition and pathoplasty models). This suggests that theories conceptualizing PE largely as a risk factor for depression should be broadened to recognize and explain bidirectional influences between the two constructs. The nature and form of these influences, however, remain to be described. As our analysis focused on symptom, rather than diagnostic, measures of depression, we were unable to distinguish between the predisposition model (which asserts that PE increases risk of disorder onset) and the pathoplasty model (which asserts that PE influences the course and expression of the disorder). Past research suggests that both models are plausible (<a href=""#R96"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R96"">Kendall et al., 2015</a>; <a href=""#R102"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R102"">D. N. Klein et al., 2011</a>), and as they have different implications for intervention, studies capable of discriminating between them are needed.</p>"
"<p id=""P86"">For similar reasons, our analysis cannot distinguish the scar model (in which declines in PE persist even after the disorder has resolved) from the complication model (in which declines in PE are temporary and last only while the illness is active). Still, our discovery that depression predicts subsequent reductions in PE over periods longer than a year hints that changes in PE are not entirely temporary. Further investigation of low PE as a sequela of depression would help clarify these and related issues, such as whether declines in PE resulting from previous depressive episodes increase risk for new depressive episodes, and whether the mechanisms involved are the same in each temporal direction.</p>"
"<p id=""P87"">Our findings also have implications for two other models of the personality-psychopathology relationship. The spectrum model suggests that disorders and traits are different manifestations of the same process; this model would be supported by high, specific correlations between PE and depression (<a href=""#R104"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R104"">Kotov et al., 2010</a>). As even the cross-sectional correlation between PE and depression was moderate in the present analysis (<em>r</em> = −.34), our results do not support this model. On the other hand, our results are broadly compatible with the common cause model, which posits that disorders and traits are associated because of shared genetic or environmental vulnerabilities. Evidence for this model comes from twin studies showing that PE and depression share a modest genetic correlation (<a href=""#R97"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R97"">Kendler, Gatz, Gardner, &amp; Pedersen, 2006</a>; <a href=""#R98"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R98"">Kendler &amp; Myers, 2010</a>). Meta-analyzing longitudinal studies for other personality traits (e.g., negative emotionality), as well as other forms of psychopathology, would shed further light on the important and complex relationship between personality and psychopathology.</p>"
"<p id=""P88"">A complete theoretical account of PE as a risk factor for depression will need to address the moderating influences identified here. We provided quantitative evidence for prior suggestions that PE is a stronger predictor of depression in adults than in children and adolescents (<a href=""#R38"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R38"">De Bolle &amp; De Fruyt, 2010</a>). The weaker relationship between PE and depression in youth could have a number of explanations, including differing manifestations of depression in children and adolescents relative to adults (<a href=""#R38"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R38"">De Bolle &amp; De Fruyt, 2010</a>; <a href=""#R84"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R84"">Jacques &amp; Mash, 2004</a>), different causal factors for early-onset relative to late-onset depression (<a href=""#R156"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R156"">Shankman, Klein, Tenke, &amp; Bruder, 2007</a>), or decreased stability of PE in childhood (<a href=""#R145"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R145"">Roberts &amp; DelVecchio, 2000</a>). While behavioral measures of low PE like reduced pursuit of positive stimuli and lower observer ratings of positive emotional expression have also been shown to predict depressive symptoms in youth (<a href=""#R47"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R47"">Dougherty, Klein, Durbin, Hayden, &amp; Olino, 2010</a>; <a href=""#R58"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R58"">Forbes et al., 2007</a>; <a href=""#R143"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R143"">Rawal et al., 2013</a>), we do not yet know whether these measures are more robust predictors of depression than self-reported PE. If this is found to be the case, it may indicate poorer validity of self-report relative to behavioral measures of PE in children and adolescents.</p>"
"<p id=""P89"">We also found a stronger relationship between PE and depression in samples with an increased likelihood of inter-assessment change, including samples that experienced a defined life event, received medical treatment, or had a high probability of receiving psychological treatment. This finding is consistent with research showing that the relationship between traits and mental disorders are stronger in the context of adverse life experiences (<a href=""#R26"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R26"">Clark, 2005</a>; <a href=""#R66"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R66"">Geschwind et al., 2010</a>). Life experiences, whether adverse or favorable (e.g., treatment), may amplify the relationship between PE and depression by increasing the need for adaptive information processing, coping strategies, and emotion regulation – all processes influenced by PE (<a href=""#R56"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R56"">Folkman &amp; Moskowitz, 2000</a>). Our moderation results may help explain inconsistencies across studies regarding the status of PE as a risk factor, as many, but not all, studies have relied on samples of individuals recruited in settings in which the possibility of treatment was high (<a href=""#R30"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R30"">Clark et al., 1994</a>; <a href=""#R52"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R52"">Enns &amp; Cox, 1997</a>; <a href=""#R155"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R155"">Shankman &amp; Klein, 2003</a>; <a href=""#R183"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R183"">Watson &amp; Naragon-Gainey, 2010</a>). Unlike previous meta-analyses (<a href=""#R94"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R94"">Kashdan, 2007</a>; <a href=""#R104"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R104"">Kotov et al., 2010</a>), however, we did not find a reliably stronger relationship between PE and depression in clinical than nonclinical samples, perhaps because of insufficient statistical power to detect these differences or our focus on longitudinal, as opposed to cross-sectional, relationships.</p>"
"<p id=""P90"">Contrary to expectations, neither the type of PE construct (positive affect, extraversion, behavioral activation) nor the time span of PE measurement (trait, state) moderated the relationship between PE and depression. This contradicts several studies in which depression related more strongly to positive affect than to the broader trait of extraversion (<a href=""#R132"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R132"">Naragon-Gainey et al., 2009</a>; <a href=""#R184"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R184"">Watson &amp; Naragon-Gainey, 2014</a>; <a href=""#R185"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R185"">Watson et al., 2015</a>). A possible reason is that those studies distinguished between facets of extraversion, whereas our analysis focused on the far larger number of studies that used complete measures of positive affect and extraversion. The present results also run counter to suggestions that depression relates more strongly to behavioral activation than to extraversion (<a href=""#R155"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R155"">Shankman &amp; Klein, 2003</a>), although the relatively small number of prospective studies measuring behavioral activation left us with low power to detect these differences. Based on the available evidence, the consistency of effect sizes across constructs and time spans suggests that the relationship of PE to depression is quite stable regardless of how PE is measured. Further evidence of stability was provided by showing that the relationship does not vary by features of study measures or indicators of study quality.</p>"
"<p id=""P91"">We found a cross-sectional relationship of PE to anxiety (<em>r</em> = −.24) that was not reliably different from the cross-sectional relationship of PE to depression (<em>r</em> = −.34). This aligns with the results of a previous meta-analysis (<a href=""#R104"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R104"">Kotov et al., 2010</a>), which reported correlations of a similar magnitude for PE with depression (<em>r</em> = −.25 to −.29) and several anxiety disorders (<em>r</em> = −.18 to −.37, excluding specific phobia). In the current study, the same pattern held when we examined the prospective and the cross-lagged relationships between these constructs. In each analysis, the effect sizes for depression and anxiety were statistically indistinguishable. Contrary to our hypothesis and prominent theoretical models of emotional disorders, these findings challenge the notion that PE is a specific risk factor for depression relative to anxiety.</p>"
"<p id=""P92"">These longitudinal results extend prior claims that low PE is a feature of certain anxiety disorders (<a href=""#R12"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R12"">Bienvenu &amp; Stein, 2003</a>; <a href=""#R183"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R183"">Watson &amp; Naragon-Gainey, 2010</a>) to suggest that PE be reframed as a general vulnerability factor for emotional disturbance rather than a specific vulnerability factor for depression. These results align with a growing recognition of dimensions of psychopathology (<a href=""#R83"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R83"">Insel, 2014</a>) and associated maintaining processes (<a href=""#R74"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R74"">Harvey, 2004</a>) that cut across disorder categories. To date, research on dimensions of temperament that increase vulnerability for both depression and anxiety has focused mainly on negative emotionality (<a href=""#R6"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R6"">Barlow, Ellard, Sauer-Zavala, Bullis, &amp; Carl, 2014</a>; <a href=""#R110"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R110"">Lahey, 2009</a>). By contrast, deficits in PE have more commonly been studied in connection with depression and schizophrenia (<a href=""#R191"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R191"">Proceedings, 2011</a>), although most studies have examined low PE as a feature of these disorders rather than a risk factor for them. Our results indicate that it will be important to extend research on PE to anxiety.</p>"
"<p id=""P93"">A further priority will be to identify variables that account for the development of each disorder in the presence of low PE. Due to the small number of available anxiety studies as well as our principal interest in the PE-depression relationship, we did not examine moderators of the PE-anxiety relationship here. As more longitudinal studies become available, it will be valuable to explore differences in moderators and mechanisms of the pathways connecting PE to depression, anxiety, and other conditions (schizophrenia, mania) in which PE has been implicated (<a href=""#R69"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R69"">Gruber et al., 2008</a>; <a href=""#R80"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R80"">Horan, Blanchard, Clark, &amp; Green, 2008</a>; <a href=""#R183"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R183"">Watson &amp; Naragon-Gainey, 2010</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P94"">The present findings have implications for the prevention and treatment of depression and anxiety. We found that PE levels were quite stable over time (the correlation between PE at Time 1 and Time 2 was .61, <em>k</em> = 32, 95% CI [.57, .65], τ<sup>2</sup> = 0.03) despite studies with long times lags, samples experiencing defined life events, and effects based on state as well as trait measures included in the analysis. This stability, together with evidence that PE precedes and predicts increases in depression and anxiety, suggests that PE could be used to identify individuals at risk for depression. Despite PE’s stability, studies have found that standard pharmacological and psychological treatments for depression can raise levels of PE (<a href=""#R49"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R49"">Du, Bakish, Ravindran, &amp; Hrdina, 2002</a>; <a href=""#R166"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R166"">Tang et al., 2009</a>). These findings speak to the possibility of intervening to increase PE with the goal of preventing the onset or recurrence of depression and anxiety. In fact, recognition that conventional treatments, which focus mainly on reducing negative emotions, may not remedy deficits in positive emotions has spurred the development of interventions that target PE. These interventions seek to enhance and prolong PE by encouraging patients to savor and actively anticipate positive experiences and by removing barriers to PE expression. Preliminary evidence suggests that these types of interventions increase PE and decrease symptoms among currently depressed and anxious individuals (<a href=""#R21"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R21"">Carl, 2015</a>; <a href=""#R123"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R123"">McMakin, Siegle, &amp; Shirk, 2011</a>). Although clinical trials are needed, these results highlight the potential of PE-focused interventions to alleviate and perhaps also prevent symptoms of depression and anxiety.</p>"
"<p id=""P95"">At the same time, the modest magnitude of the longitudinal, controlled relationship observed in this synthesis suggests that risk factors other than PE play a significant role. Previous research has identified numerous individual (e.g., negative emotionality, self-esteem) and environmental (e.g., early life experiences, social support) risk factors for depression. Theoretical models and prevention programs will benefit from further investigation of how these risk factors operate with or through PE to increase vulnerability for emotional disorders (e.g., <a href=""#R65"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R65"">Gershuny &amp; Sher, 1998</a>; <a href=""#R89"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R89"">Joiner &amp; Lonigan, 2000</a>). This will allow prevention programs to be offered to individuals whose vulnerability is especially high, and will identify the set of modifiable risk factors that are most important for such programs to address.</p>"
"<p id=""P96"">The present results are qualified by several important limitations. First, we cannot reach strong conclusions regarding causality because all studies used correlational designs. In the absence of experimental manipulation, it is possible that a third variable was responsible for these effects, especially in light of the modest reciprocal effects observed here. One particularly important third variable is negative emotionality. PE, depression, and anxiety all correlate with negative emotionality, and the extent to which negative emotionality accounts for relationships among these constructs is unclear (<a href=""#R96"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R96"">Kendall et al., 2015</a>; <a href=""#R130"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R130"">Naragon-Gainey et al., 2013</a>; <a href=""#R184"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R184"">Watson &amp; Naragon-Gainey, 2014</a>). Additional prospective studies assessing negative emotionality in conjunction with PE, depression, and anxiety would permit a more systematic evaluation of these relationships. Extending this work to consider other variables associated with both PE and depression, such as stress, substance use, and conscientiousness, would further clarify the contribution of third variables to these relationships. Although correlational findings cannot speak decisively to causality, our analysis of longitudinal studies enabled us to go a step beyond meta-analyses of cross-sectional data in evaluating PE as a risk factor and consequence of depression. Future research can more directly test low PE as a cause of symptoms through increased use of randomized controlled prevention or intervention trials, quasi-experimental designs, and statistical matching methods (<a href=""#R85"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R85"">Jaffee, Strait, &amp; Odgers, 2012</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P97"">Second, we did not determine whether PE predicts change in depression more strongly than depression predicts change in PE when both paths are considered simultaneously. Our use of cross-lagged regression effect sizes allowed us to account for the stability of the outcome variable when estimating the relationship between each predictor and outcome. This approach did not, however, allow us to adjust for the predictor variable at Time 2 or to pit one cross-lagged effect size against the other in the same analysis. Although our finding of nearly identical cross-lagged effect sizes suggests that PE predicts change in depression to much the same extent as depression predicts change in PE, it is possible that simultaneous estimation of both paths would have revealed a stronger effect for one than the other.</p>"
"<p id=""P98"">A third set of limitations stems from our focus on symptoms of depression and anxiety rather than on diagnoses of clinical disorders. As noted earlier, our focus on sympom measures meant that we could not distinguish between competing theoretical models whose predictions are linked to the timing of disorder onset and remission. Additionally, although psychological scientists may seek to understand the full range of outcomes with which PE is associated, clinical interest in PE as a risk factor may depend on its prediction of clinically significant disorders. Finally, two prior meta-analyses found that relationships between personality and psychopathology were stronger when focusing on disorders versus symptoms (<a href=""#R117"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R117"">Malouff et al., 2005</a>; <a href=""#R152"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R152"">Ruiz et al., 2008</a>). This hints that our effect sizes might have been larger had we evaluated the associations of PE with depressive and anxiety disorders rather than with symptoms.</p>"
"<p id=""P99"">A related limitation arises from our use of general, rather than specific, measures of anxiety. Although theoretical models posit that low PE is a risk factor for depression versus anxiety conceptualized generally (e.g., <a href=""#R183"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R183"">Watson &amp; Naragon-Gainey, 2010</a>), there is evidence that PE may share stronger associations with some anxiety disorders than others (<a href=""#R12"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R12"">Bienvenu &amp; Stein, 2003</a>; <a href=""#R94"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R94"">Kashdan, 2007</a>). It is also possible that PE is related more strongly to disorders or symptoms characterized by distress (major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder) than those characterized by fear (panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, specific phobia), although the available cross-sectional data do not support this assertion (<a href=""#R104"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R104"">Kotov et al., 2010</a>). Our hope is that the current study helps stimulate interest in the relationship between PE and anxiety so that future meta-analyses can test whether PE better predicts some forms of anxiety than others.</p>"
"<p id=""P100"">Despite these limitations, a focus on general depression and anxiety symptoms has some significant advantages. Studies that test theories of PE as a risk factor for depression typically utilize symptom measures (<a href=""#R59"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R59"">Fowles, 1994</a>; <a href=""#R68"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R68"">Gray, 1994</a>; <a href=""#R179"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R179"">Watson, 2009</a>; <a href=""#R182"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R182"">Watson et al., 2005</a>); as a result, the number of effect sizes available for symptom measures far outnumber those available for diagnostic measures. Similarly, many more effect sizes are available for general, rather than specific, anxiety measures. Furthermore, assessments of symptoms are usually more reliable than dichotomous, disorder-based measures (<a href=""#R24"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R24"">Chmielewski et al., 2015</a>; <a href=""#R132"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R132"">Naragon-Gainey et al., 2009</a>). Importantly, our finding that PE is not specific to depression is consistent with a recent meta-analysis of cross-sectional studies that used diagnostic rather than symptom measures (<a href=""#R104"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R104"">Kotov et al., 2010</a>). That meta-analysis found that nearly all anxiety disorders, as well as depressive disorders, were associated with decreased levels of PE, suggesting that the pattern of effects observed here may generalize to diagnostic measures and to clinical presentations characterized by distress or fear.</p>"
"<p id=""P101"">Fourth, the majority of studies in this meta-analysis used self-report measures. Although effect sizes did not differ for studies using self- versus other-report, it is possible that the preponderance of self-report measures inflated estimates of effect size due to shared method variance. This limitation is more applicable to the cross-sectional and uncontrolled prospective relationships, as shared method variance was reduced for cross-lagged effects by controlling for prior levels of the outcome variable (<a href=""#R161"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R161"">Sowislo &amp; Orth, 2013</a>). It is possible that this control for shared method variance was partly responsible for the attenuation in effect size between the prospective, uncontrolled relationship and the cross-lagged relationship of PE with depression.</p>"
"<p id=""P102"">Fifth, while we tested the relationship of PE to both depression and anxiety, it is important to keep in mind that there is significant content overlap in these measures (<a href=""#R186"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R186"">Watson et al., 1995</a>). This likely limited our ability to detect differential relationships with PE. That said, these measures reflect the typical assessment of depression and anxiety in the literature, and they include assessment of non-overlapping as well as overlapping symptoms (<a href=""#R179"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R179"">Watson, 2009</a>). More widespread use of measures that better distinguish between depression and anxiety would enhance future efforts to evaluate specificity (<a href=""#R186"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R186"">Watson et al., 1995</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P103"">A sixth limitation concerns the relatively small number of studies included in the meta-analysis. This was especially a limitation of the anxiety analyses, but may have also limited our ability to detect more modest moderation effects and the influence of moderators that were represented by relatively few studies (e.g., behavioral activation measures of PE). Additionally, the cross-sectional effect sizes presented in this paper were derived only from studies including a longitudinal component and therefore do not represent an exhaustive review of the literature.</p>"
"<p id=""P104"">Finally, we did not test for mediators of the relationships of PE to depression and anxiety. Surprisingly few studies have examined mediators of these relationships, although this work is beginning to be done. For example, there is some evidence that the relationship between low PE and later depression is mediated by supportive relationships (<a href=""#R54"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R54"">Finch &amp; Graziano, 2001</a>; <a href=""#R190"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R190"">Wetter &amp; Hankin, 2009</a>). It will be important for future research to identify constructs that account for the link between PE and symptoms, as these constructs represent potential targets for treatment.</p>"
"<p id=""P105"">Even with consideration of these limitations, this meta-analysis is the first to quantify the prospective relationship between a broad personality dimension and symptoms of depression or anxiety. Strengths of this analysis included the examination of longitudinal as well as cross-sectional relationships between PE and symptoms, the rigorous evaluation of PE as a risk factor by controlling for initial symptom levels, the evaluation of directionality by testing symptoms as risk factors for PE, and the evaluation of specificity by testing relationships with anxiety as well as depression. Our results provide support for theoretical accounts that cast low PE as a vulnerability factor for depression. At the same time, these results highlight the need to identify additional vulnerability factors, understand the mechanisms responsible for bidirectional relationships between personality and symptoms, and extend this work to other forms of psychopathology in which PE plays a role.</p>"

"<p class=""display-inline"">Correlations among the PE constructs of positive affect, extraversion, and behavioral activation have been reported in the range of .48 to .66 (<a href=""#R130"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R130"">Naragon-Gainey et al., 2013</a>). Following the lead of other researchers, we defined PE as including all three of these constructs (<a href=""#R17"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R17"">Brown, 2007</a>; <a href=""#R30"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R30"">Clark et al., 1994</a>; <a href=""#R130"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R130"">Naragon-Gainey et al., 2013</a>; <a href=""#R132"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R132"">Naragon-Gainey et al., 2009</a>). Initially, we also planned to include the related construct of reward dependence from the Tridimensional Personality Model (<a href=""#R31"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R31"">Cloninger, Przybeck, &amp; Svrakic, 1991</a>; <a href=""#R52"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R52"">Enns &amp; Cox, 1997</a>), but as we found few longitudinal studies of reward dependence and depression, we excluded this construct from our analysis.</p>"
"<p class=""display-inline"">As PE has also been studied in relation to schizophrenia/schizotypy (<a href=""#R80"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R80"">Horan et al., 2008</a>; <a href=""#R183"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R183"">Watson &amp; Naragon-Gainey, 2010</a>), we initially planned to include this relationship as a further test of specificity. Due to the very small number of longitudinal studies, however, we were unable to include schizophrenia/schizotypy in the analysis.</p>"
"<p class=""display-inline"">To rule out differences in study characteristics as an explanation for differences between effect sizes, we reran these analyses using a common set of studies for which all five effect sizes could be calculated (<em>k</em> = 31). The resulting effect sizes were very similar to those presented in the paper and the overall pattern of results was unchanged (see <a href=""#SD2"" class=""usa-link"">Supplementary Table 3</a>).</p>"
"<p class=""display-inline"">To ensure that Fisher’s <em>Zr</em> transformation was not biasing the cross-lagged effect sizes, we recomputed them without first transforming each correlation. These untransformed effect sizes were essentially the same as those reported in the paper.</p>"
"<p class=""display-inline"">We reran these analyses using only the studies that provided effect size data for both depression and anxiety. In this small sample (<em>k</em> ranged from 10–20, including just one-third of available depression studies), the effect sizes were very similar to those presented in the paper, although the cross-sectional and prospective, uncontrolled relationships between PE at Time 1 and depression at Time 2 were larger than the corresponding relationships between PE and anxiety when compared using robust variance estimation, both <em>β</em> &gt; −.09, both <em>p</em> &lt; .01 (see <a href=""#SD2"" class=""usa-link"">Supplementary Table 4</a>).</p>"

"<p>Social anxiety is common in psychosis and associated with impaired functioning, poorer quality of life, and higher symptom severity. This study systematically reviewed factors maintaining social anxiety in people with attenuated, transient, or persistent psychotic experiences. Other correlates of social anxiety were also examined. MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, and PsycINFO were searched for relevant literature up to October 19, 2020. Forty-eight articles were eligible for narrative synthesis: 38 cross-sectional studies, 8 prospective studies, 1 uncontrolled trial, and 1 qualitative study. From 12060 participants, the majority was general population (<em>n</em> = 8771), followed by psychosis samples (<em>n</em> = 2532) and those at high risk of psychosis (<em>n</em> = 757). The methodological quality and risk of bias were assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Ninety percent of studies were rated as high to very-high quality. Poorer quality studies typically failed to adequately control for confounds and provided insufficient information on the measurement validity and reliability. Prominent psychological factors maintaining social anxiety included self-perceptions of stigma and shame. Common correlates of social anxiety included poorer functioning and lower quality of life. In conclusion, stigma and shame could be targeted as a causal mechanism in future interventional studies. The integration of findings from this review lead us to propose a new theoretical model to guide future intervention research.</p>"

"<p>Although there were identified metacognitive factors including ToM, metacognitive mastery, mentalization and reasoning biases, not all relationships between social anxiety and metacognition were linear. This is perhaps because those people with a lower level of metacognition might not be aware of a socially feared event, while those with higher level might have a better adaptation to deal with problems with social anxiety, resulting in reduced severity, when compared to those with a moderate level.<sup><a href=""#CIT0079"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0079"">79</a>,<a href=""#CIT0081"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0081"">81</a></sup> It was evidenced that metacognitive beliefs were found to empirically contribute to social anxiety,<sup><a href=""#CIT0096"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0096"">96</a></sup> and metacognitive processes of people with psychosis can be changed in an experimental study.<sup><a href=""#CIT0097"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0097"">97</a></sup> Though there is promising evidence, findings on metacognitive factors were mixed and synthesis of these findings is made difficult by different approaches to the definition and measurement of metacognition.</p>"
"<p>We found limited evidence that behavioral factors have been systematically investigated. This is a neglected area of research and our findings show promise in delineating the role of social avoidance and other defensive behaviors (ie, PEP) in the maintenance of social anxiety. Because safety behaviors, such as social avoidance play a role in maintaining social anxiety,<sup><a href=""#CIT0084"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0084"">84</a></sup> then intervention on these factors should reduce social anxiety experiences in psychotic contexts.</p>"
"<p>Importantly, although largely findings were drawn from cross-sectional studies, we found consistent evidence for the potential role of cognitive factors, which the candidate factors can be the <em>stigma and shame</em>. Because they fit with the substantial characteristics of potential mechanism in the interventionist-causal approach,<sup><a href=""#CIT0027"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0027"">27</a></sup> which the stigma and shame were measurable<sup><a href=""#CIT0067"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0067"">67</a>,<a href=""#CIT0068"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0068"">68</a>,<a href=""#CIT0098"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0098"">98</a></sup> and can be developed in the theoretical understanding to guide therapy.<sup><a href=""#CIT0059"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0059"">59</a></sup> Furthermore, these factors are likely to be amenable to change with psychological interventions targeting these factors as a causal mechanism.

"<p>Social anxiety was frequently associated with 2 correlates including poorer functioning and lower QoL, followed by lower well-being, family factors and personality factors, anomalous experiences, and other correlates presented in the result section. From our review, lower functioning was consistently associated with higher social anxiety amongst people with psychosis.

"<p>The cognition model processing of social anxiety to severe threat. <em>Note</em>: the gradient shading box shows the intensity continuum of social anxiety to paranoia; the darker color the more paranoia, as followed: Perceived self as ridiculed/embarrassment (eg, I look awkward/sick); Ideas of reference (eg, people talking about me); Mild threat and harm from others (eg, people trying to cause minor distress, such as irritation); Moderate threat and harm (eg, people deliberately trying to approach me, such as being hostile towards me); and Severe threat and harm (eg, people trying to cause significant physical psychological or social harm).</p>"
"<p>Three major processes of the model were constructed. We will use stigma and shame to explain the model. With the proximal social assumptions, individuals with bio-psycho-social vulnerabilities are, firstly, aware that other people are critical when encountering feared social situation. Due to negative processing the self as a social object, individuals may feel different, vulnerable or stigmatized, the <em>internalized negative self-representation</em> is formed.</p>"
"<p>Secondly, activation of the internalized self-representations, are then subject to metacognitive processing. The individual with internal stigma- and shame-based representations may perceive their <em>self as ridiculed</em> (eg, I look awkward), or at risk of social <em>harm from others</em> (eg, others are threatening). One can perceive threat at different level consistent with the hierarchy model (see the shading box in <a href=""#F2"" class=""usa-link"">figure 2</a>).<sup><a href=""#CIT0032"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0032"">32</a></sup> Then, their perceived assumptions will be assessed relating to: social attitudes, called <em>other-to-self focus</em> (eg, neighbors disgust people like me); and self-image, called <em>self-to-self focus</em> (eg, I am indeed despicable).</p>"
"<p>Lastly, negative appraisals about stigma and shame result in <em>defensive behaviors</em> (eg, avoiding eye contact), and <em>cognitive</em> (eg, hypervigilance due to anticipating other attitudes) <em>and physical symptoms</em> (eg, sweating, tremor) of anxiety. These symptoms interact in vicious circles via PEP. These defensive behaviors also maintain and prevent disconfirmation of the negative belief of social anxiety in psychosis. <em>Negative consequences</em> may appear as poorer daily functioning, QoL, well-being, and increased hopelessness and suicidality. Additionally, although negative affect can be a negative consequence, nonetheless, it was not included in the model, because negative affect also increases accessibility of negative appraisals and feelings of stigma/shame that, in turn, increases social anxiety.</p>"
"<p>Our model aims to help people suffering from social anxiety in the context of psychosis. Although the psychological factors related to experiencing discrimination (stigma/shame) are not unique to SAD in psychosis, these factors are very relevant in SAD in psychosis compared to the established cognitive model of social anxiety.<sup><a href=""#CIT0084"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0084"">84</a></sup> Due to our findings being drawn mostly from cross-sectional studies with limited evidence of experimental and manipulationist tests, additional studies will be needed to develop better effective treatment of SAD in psychosis. Stigma and shame should be tested in interventionist-causal manipulation designs, using social anxiety as the dependent variable and stigma/shame as the mediator variables.</p>"
"<p>This review has a number of strengths. The factors that maintain significant social anxiety problems in psychosis and other relevant correlates were thoroughly examined. We used rigorous methods (eg, independent study selection), took a broad and inclusive approach, and assessed the quality of the literature. But there are also limitations to be considered. We did not include non-English-language studies and unpublished gray literature which may have resulted in publication bias and exclusion of some relevant evidence. However, we believe this limitation is minimal as we utilized a comprehensive literature searching and covered studies from diverse geographical regions (Africa, Asia-Pacific, North America, and Europe). Secondly, the quality assessment, indicates that many studies did not address confounding factors and may not have proven the validity/reliability of study measures. This could lead to erroneous conclusions<sup><a href=""#CIT0104"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0104"">104</a></sup> and minimize trustworthiness<sup><a href=""#CIT0105"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0105"">105</a></sup> of a study. Majority of studies, nonetheless, were met at least 4**** (of 5*****) quality criteria. We observed a gender disparity across studies with men over-represented in the psychosis samples. In contrast, the general population and high-risk samples showed comparable proportions of male and female participants. Lastly, the heterogeneity of data prevented us from applying meta-analysis.</p>"
"<p>Most studies were cross-sectional and conducted with Westernized English-speaking populations. Cross-cultural studies are required to improve understanding of the role that culture plays in the experience of stigma and the expression of psychopathology.<sup><a href=""#CIT0106"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0106"">106</a></sup> It is already known that the content of persecutory delusion is likely to depend on culturally prevalent threats or beliefs about malevolent influence<sup><a href=""#CIT0107"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0107"">107</a>,<a href=""#CIT0108"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0108"">108</a></sup> and so it is relevant to examine whether these effects extend to social anxiety related beliefs and appraisals. The development of experimental designs using interventionist-causal methods with targeted factor and focus whether modifying safety behaviors associated with reducing social anxiety in psychosis should be tested. Moreover, due to lack of evidence on other psychotic experiences, given the potential impact of psychotic experiences; for example, voices in social interactions,<sup><a href=""#CIT0109"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0109"">109</a></sup> this also seems to be an important topic for exploration.</p>"
"<p>Our analysis of the literature suggest that stigma and shame are key candidate psychological mechanisms with a strong role in maintaining social anxiety in the context of psychosis. Given the generally strong methodological quality of the included studies we can be reasonably confident that these cognitive factors warrant further investigation. For example, further studies using psychometrically robust methods and applying mediation analyses will help disentangle the different factors involved the spectrum of problems from social anxiety to paranoia. Both stigma and shame meet the criteria for being treated as relevant factors in an interventionist-causal model that we offer. This clinical model could be used as a basis for treatment development. Given that social anxiety was reliably associated with poorer functioning and QoL there is an important clinical need to improve targeted treatments for these problems.</p>"

"<p>Substance use is associated with common mental health disorders, but the causal effect of specific substances is uncertain. We investigate whether adolescent cannabis and cigarette use is associated with incident depression and anxiety, while attempting to account for confounding and reverse causation.</p>"
"<p>We used data from ALSPAC, a UK birth cohort study, to investigate associations between cannabis or cigarettes (measured at age 16) and depression or anxiety (measured at age 18), before and after adjustment for pre-birth, childhood and adolescent confounders. Our imputed sample size was 4561 participants.</p>"
"<p>Both cannabis (unadjusted OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.26, 1.80) and cigarette use (OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.16, 1.61) increased the odds of developing depression. Adjustment for pre-birth and childhood confounders partly attenuated these relationships though strong evidence of association persisted for cannabis use. There was weak evidence of association for cannabis (fully adjusted OR 1.30, 95% CI 0.98, 1.72) and insufficient evidence for association for cigarette use (fully adjusted OR = 0.97, 95% CI 0.75, 1.24) after mutually adjusting for each other, or for alcohol or other substance use. Neither cannabis nor cigarette use were associated with anxiety after adjustment for pre-birth and childhood confounders.</p>"
"<p>Whilst evidence of association between cannabis use and depression persisted after adjusting for pre-term and childhood confounders, our results highlight the difficulties in trying to estimate and interpret independent effects of cannabis and tobacco on psychopathology. Complementary methods are required to robustly examine effects of cannabis and tobacco on psychopathology.</p>"
"<p>A variety of mental health problems, including depression and anxiety, occur more commonly in substance users than non-users.[<a href=""#pone.0122896.ref001"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""pone.0122896.ref001"">1</a>–<a href=""#pone.0122896.ref004"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""pone.0122896.ref004"">4</a>] However, discerning causation from confounding, reverse causation, or selection or measurement bias in observational studies is problematic.[<a href=""#pone.0122896.ref005"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""pone.0122896.ref005"">5</a>] The cannabinoid system in the brain has been implicated in emotional regulation,[<a href=""#pone.0122896.ref006"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""pone.0122896.ref006"">6</a>] but biological mechanisms that might underlie the association between cannabis use and depression are not known, and indeed effects of cannabis may differ between the short and long term. For example, while people often report that cannabis acutely elevates their mood, long-term cannabis users show an increased risk of a number of adverse outcomes, including poorer education and social functioning,[<a href=""#pone.0122896.ref007"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""pone.0122896.ref007"">7</a>] which might be expected to increase risk of depression.</p>"
"<p>A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of longitudinal studies reported a 1.17-fold increase in odds of depression (95% CI 1.05, 1.30) in cannabis users, with a larger effect (OR = 1.62, 95% CI 1.21, 2.16) for heavy use,[<a href=""#pone.0122896.ref008"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""pone.0122896.ref008"">8</a>] and concluded that cannabis is associated with a modest increase in risk of developing depressive disorders. An earlier meta-analysis reported a similar association, but the authors argued that the majority of contributing studies did not adequately account for the possibility of reverse causation.[<a href=""#pone.0122896.ref009"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""pone.0122896.ref009"">9</a>] They also noted the wide variation in the number and type of confounders adjusted for. In particular, about half the studies included in their meta-analysis made no adjustment for alcohol or other drug use, which, given their potential depressogenic and anxiogenic effects during intoxication and withdrawal,[<a href=""#pone.0122896.ref010"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""pone.0122896.ref010"">10</a>, <a href=""#pone.0122896.ref011"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""pone.0122896.ref011"">11</a>] strongly suggests the potential for residual confounding. Similar problems are likely to exist for determining the causal role of cannabis on anxiety.[<a href=""#pone.0122896.ref009"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""pone.0122896.ref009"">9</a>]</p>"
"<p>Tobacco use is also more common in people with depression and anxiety compared to the general population,[<a href=""#pone.0122896.ref001"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""pone.0122896.ref001"">1</a>, <a href=""#pone.0122896.ref003"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""pone.0122896.ref003"">3</a>] and determining if these associations are causal is beset with the same difficulties as for cannabis. Whilst some studies indicate that smoking may be a self-medication behaviour,[<a href=""#pone.0122896.ref012"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""pone.0122896.ref012"">12</a>] other studies provide evidence in support of a biological causal mechanism for this association. For example, findings from animal studies suggest that nicotine effects on strengthening excitatory synapses on midbrain dopamine neurons might weaken coping mechanisms.[<a href=""#pone.0122896.ref013"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""pone.0122896.ref013"">13</a>]</p>"
"<p>The main aim of this study was to investigate the association between cannabis and cigarette use and incident depression and anxiety, whilst attempting to address issues relating to confounding, reverse causation and bias as robustly as we could. Furthermore, as cannabis and cigarette use are also associated with psychotic experiences (PEs), and we recently reported such associations within this sample,[<a href=""#pone.0122896.ref014"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""pone.0122896.ref014"">14</a>] we also examine the specificity of cannabis and cigarettes by comparing their effects on depression with those for PEs.</p>"
"<p>The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) is a prospective, population-based birth cohort study that recruited 14,541 pregnant women resident in Avon, UK, with expected delivery dates April 1 1991 to December 31 1992 (<a href=""http://www.alspac.bris.ac.uk"" class=""usa-link usa-link--external"" data-ga-action=""click_feat_suppl"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://www.alspac.bris.ac.uk</a>).

The current study is based on 4,561 individuals who completed the Revised Clinical Interview Schedule (CIS-R) at age 18.

"<p>Cannabis and cigarette use at age 16 were measured via self-report questionnaire (N = 5,068 &amp; N = 5,074 respectively). Cumulative cannabis use was coded as a 4 level category variable: ‘0 times’, ‘1–20 times’, ‘21–60 times’ and ‘more than 60 times’ (see <a href=""#pone.0122896.s001"" class=""usa-link"">S1 File</a> for further details). Frequency of smoking was coded as a 4 level category variable: ‘non-smokers’, ‘experimenters’, ‘weekly smokers’ and ‘daily smokers’.</p>"
"<p>Depression and anxiety were assessed at age 18 using the CIS-R [<a href=""#pone.0122896.ref016"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""pone.0122896.ref016"">16</a>] via a self-administered computerised interview. The primary outcomes were binary variables of depression (mild, moderate or severe) and of anxiety disorder (any of generalised anxiety disorder, social phobia, specific phobia, panic disorder, or agoraphobia) derived from algorithms based on ICD-10 criteria for unipolar depression and anxiety disorders respectively (see <a href=""#pone.0122896.s001"" class=""usa-link"">S1 File</a> for further details).</p>"
"<p>Based on the literature for associations between both cannabis and cigarette use with depression and anxiety, we considered the following as potential confounders: a) pre-birth confounders (<em>family history of depression[<a href=""#pone.0122896.ref017"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""pone.0122896.ref017"">17</a>]</em> [binary measure assessed via maternal questionnaire], <em>maternal education[<a href=""#pone.0122896.ref018"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""pone.0122896.ref018"">18</a>]</em> [a 5-level categorical variable assessed via maternal questionnaire], <em>urban living</em> [urban/town/village/hamlet, obtained from postcode of residence], and <em>gender[<a href=""#pone.0122896.ref019"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""pone.0122896.ref019"">19</a>]</em>); and b) childhood confounders (<em>IQ</em> at age 8[<a href=""#pone.0122896.ref020"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""pone.0122896.ref020"">20</a>] [assessed via Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children[<a href=""#pone.0122896.ref021"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""pone.0122896.ref021"">21</a>]], <em>borderline personality traits[<a href=""#pone.0122896.ref022"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""pone.0122896.ref022"">22</a>]</em> [an 8-level measure assessed via interview at age 11], <em>victimisation[<a href=""#pone.0122896.ref023"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""pone.0122896.ref023"">23</a>]</em> [a binary measure assessed at age 8 via interview], <em>peer problems[<a href=""#pone.0122896.ref024"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""pone.0122896.ref024"">24</a>]</em> [a 10-point scale assessed via the strengths and difficulties interview at age 8[<a href=""#pone.0122896.ref025"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""pone.0122896.ref025"">25</a>]], and <em>conduct disorder</em> trajectory group ages 4–13[<a href=""#pone.0122896.ref026"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""pone.0122896.ref026"">26</a>] [membership of one of 4 trajectory paths (early onset persistent/childhood-limited/adolescent onset/low) as described in[<a href=""#pone.0122896.ref027"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""pone.0122896.ref027"">27</a>]]).

"<p>We carried out the analyses in STATA version 13 (Stata Corp LP, College Station, TX USA) and Mplus. We assessed exposure-outcome relationships before and after adjustment for confounders using logistic regression. We excluded individuals with depression (cut-off score of 11 on moods and feelings questionnaire (MFQ)[<a href=""#pone.0122896.ref031"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""pone.0122896.ref031"">31</a>, <a href=""#pone.0122896.ref032"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""pone.0122896.ref032"">32</a>]) or anxiety (from DAWBA[<a href=""#pone.0122896.ref033"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""pone.0122896.ref033"">33</a>]) at age 16 from the relevant analyses, in order to minimise reverse causation. We examined the impact of confounding by comparing unadjusted estimates (model 1) with those adjusting for pre-birth confounders (model 2), and those further adjusted for childhood confounders (model 3). Further adjustment was made separately for age 16 cigarette use or cannabis use as appropriate (model 4a), alcohol use (model 4b), and other illicit drug use (model 4c). Finally, we also ran a fully adjusted analysis (model 5). This step-wise approach was used to elucidate the impact of different confounders on the associations.</p>"
"<p>We used a bivariate probit regression model in Mplus to investigate whether cannabis (or cigarettes) had similar (or different) effects on depression as they did on PEs, whilst taking into account their comorbidity. Using Wald tests, we compared a model where effect estimates for depression and PEs were allowed to differ with one where they were constrained to be the same. Probit estimates were converted to approximate odds ratios (ORs) to allow for easier interpretation. A binary measure of PEs (suspected or definite versus none) at age 18 was derived following a semi-structured interview conducted by trained psychologists.[<a href=""#pone.0122896.ref034"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""pone.0122896.ref034"">34</a>]</p>"
"<p>The complete sample with data on outcomes, exposures and confounders was 1791 (<a href=""#pone.0122896.g001"" class=""usa-link"">Fig 1</a>). To address the potential bias introduced by attrition in our sample we conducted multiple imputation, creating 100 imputed datasets using additional information from over 50 variables associated with our observed measures and with missingness to make the assumption that data were ‘missing at random’ more plausible. The measures included related to pre-birth factors, childhood and adolescent behaviours, and earlier measures of psychopathology and substance use at various ages. Our primary results are presented using this sample with imputed confounder and exposure data (imputed sample N = 4561). There were 4345 people who had information on both depression and PEs at age 18, for the imputed bivariate analysis. Omitting those with previous depression or anxiety from imputed data is not trivial,[<a href=""#pone.0122896.ref035"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""pone.0122896.ref035"">35</a>] therefore the same estimates were obtained using a series of appropriately parameterized interaction models. Pre-existing depression or anxiety was included as a moderator variable in both the imputation and the analyses that followed. Given the number of interaction terms required, a separate imputation model was derived for each exposure/outcome pair in turn.</p>"

Further adjustment for adolescent substance use led to further attenuation in the size of the association (fully adjusted OR 1.30, 95% CI 0.98, 1.72).

"<p>Cigarette use at age 16 was associated with an increased odds of depression at age 18 (unadjusted OR per category of cigarette use = 1.37, 95% CI 1.16, 1.61).

"<p>There were 162 (9.0%, 95% CI 7.8, 10.5) participants in our sample with anxiety at age 18. There was weak evidence of an association between cannabis use and anxiety disorder at age 18, but no evidence after adjustment for pre-birth and childhood confounders (<a href=""#pone.0122896.s002"" class=""usa-link"">S1 Table</a>), and further attenuation still after adjusting for substance use (unadjusted OR = 1.13, 95% CI 0.98, 1.31; fully adjusted OR = 0.96, 95% CI 0.75, 1.24). The same pattern of association was seen between cigarette use and anxiety (unadjusted OR = 1.14, 95% CI 1.00, 1.30; fully adjusted OR = 0.85, 95% CI 0.69, 1.04).</p>"
"<p>In the complete case analysis, associations between cannabis and depression were of a larger magnitude than in the imputed sample (<a href=""#pone.0122896.s003"" class=""usa-link"">S2 Table</a>). Adjustment for cigarette use increased the estimate size, and the fully adjusted OR was larger than the unadjusted. Associations between cigarette use and depression were broadly similar to the imputed sample. Associations between cannabis and anxiety and between cigarettes and anxiety were also broadly similar to the imputed sample (<a href=""#pone.0122896.s004"" class=""usa-link"">S3 Table</a>).</p>"
"<p>Intensity of cannabis use at age 16 was associated with an increased incidence of depression at age 18. Adjusting for confounders assessed pre-birth and during childhood partly attenuated the association with depression, although strong evidence for an association with depression persisted. Further adjustment for cigarette, alcohol, or other drug use weakened the evidence of association with depression, but also widened the confidence intervals around the effect estimates. The strong correlation between cannabis use and other substances, particularly cigarette use, may have led to collinearity problems with the statistical model, as evinced by the increase in the size of the standard errors, and makes it difficult to interpret the results of cannabis independently from those for other substance use.</p>"
"<p>In addition, investigation of cannabis users who claimed not to smoke cigarettes in our study revealed that the vast majority of them (44 out of 47) used tobacco with their cannabis and were thus still exposed to tobacco.[<a href=""#pone.0122896.ref014"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""pone.0122896.ref014"">14</a>] Therefore, our study (and almost certainly other studies in countries where cannabis is smoked with tobacco that have adjusted for cigarette smoking) will not have adequately adjusted for tobacco use. A further difficulty in interpreting results adjusted for cigarette or other substance use is that it is feasible that use of these substances occurred secondary to the use of cannabis, for example through exposure to situations where tobacco, alcohol or other drugs became more readily available. This is an example of “collider bias”[<a href=""#pone.0122896.ref036"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""pone.0122896.ref036"">36</a>] and could have biased estimates of the association between cannabis and depression.[<a href=""#pone.0122896.ref037"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""pone.0122896.ref037"">37</a>]</p>"
"<p>Cigarette use was also associated with an increased incidence of depression. However, adjusting for confounders measured pre-birth and during childhood attenuated the association with depression to a greater extent than they did for cannabis and depression. Further adjustment for cannabis or other substance use eliminated this association, though the same problem of potential collider bias exists here too.</p>"
"<p>In contrast to our findings for depression, there was only weak evidence of associations between cannabis or cigarettes and anxiety, and these associations were eliminated after adjusting for pre-birth and childhood confounders.</p>"
"<p>Whilst most results were similar in the sensitivity analysis using our smaller, non-imputed (complete case) sample, one exception was that the association between cannabis and depression <em>increased</em> after adjustment for cigarette use. One explanation for this difference is that our complete case analysis is biased as a result of non-differential attrition. Indeed the direction of change in the estimate after adjusting for cigarette use is opposite to that expected given the relationship between cigarette use and depression, and that between cigarette use and cannabis. Our multiple imputation analysis is likely to be correcting for this to some extent as our imputation model was carefully designed to try and accurately predict the missingness in our variables.</p>"
"<p>The effect sizes we observed are consistent with previous meta-analyses that have reported associations between cannabis use and later depression of a moderate-sized effect.[<a href=""#pone.0122896.ref008"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""pone.0122896.ref008"">8</a>, <a href=""#pone.0122896.ref009"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""pone.0122896.ref009"">9</a>] Furthermore, whilst we do not find evidence to support an association between cannabis use and incident anxiety we cannot exclude a small effect compatible with confidence limits from a recent meta-analysis of association between cannabis use and anxiety.[<a href=""#pone.0122896.ref038"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""pone.0122896.ref038"">38</a>] Although authors of that study attempted to assess the quality of included studies, estimating causal effect sizes from meta-analyses of observational studies are inherently limited by inclusion of studies with sub-optimal adjustment for confounding. For example, in Moore and colleagues’ meta-analysis attenuation of unadjusted estimates was greater in studies that adjusted for the most comprehensive sets of confounders.[<a href=""#pone.0122896.ref009"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""pone.0122896.ref009"">9</a>]</p>"
"<p>Whilst research from post-mortem human brain,[<a href=""#pone.0122896.ref039"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""pone.0122896.ref039"">39</a>] neuroimaging,[<a href=""#pone.0122896.ref040"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""pone.0122896.ref040"">40</a>] and animal[<a href=""#pone.0122896.ref041"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""pone.0122896.ref041"">41</a>] studies provide some evidence of plausible mechanisms by which cannabis might cause depression, this body of evidence is by no means compelling. For example, evidence from animal models suggests that tetrahydrocannabinol (THC: a cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) agonist) during adolescence increases adult anhedonia and other models of depression and anxiety,[<a href=""#pone.0122896.ref042"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""pone.0122896.ref042"">42</a>, <a href=""#pone.0122896.ref043"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""pone.0122896.ref043"">43</a>] but there is also evidence that rimonabant (a CB1 antagonist) increases anxiety, depression and suicidality.[<a href=""#pone.0122896.ref044"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""pone.0122896.ref044"">44</a>] Differences between acute and longer term effects of cannabis on the brain have yet to be clearly elucidated, and have to incorporate evidence of euphoria during acute intoxication with long-term adverse outcomes in cannabis users such as impaired occupational and social function that might be expected to increase depression (though studies of these outcomes are subject to the same problems of residual confounding as studies of depression). Furthermore, whilst studies comparing the effects of cannabis strains with different concentrations of THC, or different ratios of THC to cannabidiol (a cannabinoid that acts as a CB1 antagonist) on depression and anxiety can potentially help with understanding of the causal role of cannabis on these disorders, there are few such studies to date.[<a href=""#pone.0122896.ref045"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""pone.0122896.ref045"">45</a>]</p>"
"<p>Despite a common impression that the evidence supporting a causal effect of cannabis on psychosis is stronger than that for depression we found no evidence that associations between cannabis or cigarette use and depression were different to those between cannabis or cigarette use and PEs in our bivariate analysis. Whilst it is possible that we did not have adequate power to detect a difference, nevertheless our results suggest that associations between substance use and mental health, if causal, seem to be non-specific, both in terms of substances and outcomes.</p>"
"<p>There are a number of important limitations to our study. First, wave non-response and attrition (almost inevitable in a longitudinal study of this nature) means that our sample was small compared to the original ALSPAC sample, and power to detect small effects was limited; nevertheless our sample was still larger than most other cohorts that have examined the research questions we address here,[<a href=""#pone.0122896.ref009"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""pone.0122896.ref009"">9</a>] and we used multiple imputation to reduce attrition bias. It is possible that our imputation did not adequately address the missing at random assumption and that bias from selective attrition persisted, or that higher-order confounding was present and inadequately represented in the imputed models. However, imputed models are still likely to be less biased than use of complete case data. Our exposure measures were based on self-report data, which might be a limitation particularly for illicit drug use. If, for example, proneness to depression made individuals more reluctant to admit to illegal drug use this may have led to us underestimating the association between cannabis use and depression, though we have no reasons to suspect this occurred. Our outcome measures were assessed via computerised interview, therefore may not fully have captured depression or anxiety in the participants. However, prevalence was equivalent to that expected from previous literature [<a href=""#pone.0122896.ref046"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""pone.0122896.ref046"">46</a>, <a href=""#pone.0122896.ref047"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""pone.0122896.ref047"">47</a>]. Finally, the problem of co-occurrence of cannabis and tobacco in this and other studies to date has already been discussed above, and would not be improved substantially by increasing sample size or having more accurate measures of substance use. Identifying populations where individuals use cannabis without mixing it with tobacco may help address this limitation, though we are not aware of any longitudinal studies in such populations currently. Utilising genetic variants associated with tobacco or cannabis use as instrumental variables in Mendelian randomisation analyses offers a potential approach for determining whether cannabis or tobacco have causal effects on psychopathology, but is limited by requirement of samples larger than currently available,[<a href=""#pone.0122896.ref048"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""pone.0122896.ref048"">48</a>] and by the absence of genetic proxies for cannabis use.[<a href=""#pone.0122896.ref049"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""pone.0122896.ref049"">49</a>]</p>"
"<p>Whilst most associations we examined were explained to a substantial degree by confounders assessed pre-term or during childhood, strong evidence of association between cannabis use and depression persisted. However, interpreting results for cannabis or cigarette use independent of each other is problematic, and our study highlights the limitations inherent in observational studies that aim to determine whether cannabis or tobacco use have causal effects on psychopathology. Novel approaches are required to determine whether associations between cannabis or tobacco and psychopathology are causal, and to help inform public knowledge and health prevention policy.</p>"

"<p>Social dysfunction in schizophrenia includes symptoms of withdrawal and deficits in social skills, social cognition, and social motivation. Based on the course of illness, with social withdrawal occurring prior to psychosis onset, it is likely that the severity of social withdrawal/isolation contributes to schizophrenia neuropathology.</p>"
"<p>We review the current literature on social isolation in rodent models and provide a conceptual framework for its relationship to social withdrawal and neural circuit dysfunction in schizophrenia. We next review preclinical tasks of social behavior used in schizophrenia-relevant models and discuss strengths and limitations of existing approaches. Lastly, we consider new effort-based tasks of social motivation and their potential for translational studies in schizophrenia.</p>"
"<p>Social isolation rearing in rats produces profound differences in behavior, pharmacologic sensitivity, and neurochemistry compared to socially reared rats. Rodent models relevant to schizophrenia exhibit deficits in social behavior as measured by social interaction and social preference tests. Newer tasks of effort-based social motivation are being developed in rodents to better model social motivation deficits in neuropsychiatric disorders.</p>"
"<p>While experimenter-imposed social isolation provides a viable experimental model for understanding some biological mechanisms linking social dysfunction to clinical and neural pathology in schizophrenia, it bypasses critical antecedents to social isolation in schizophrenia, notably deficits in social reward and social motivation. Recent efforts at modeling social motivation using effort-based tasks in rodents have the potential to quantify these antecedents, identify models (eg, developmental, genetic) that produce deficits, and advance pharmacological treatments for social motivation.</p>"

"<p>Recent studies in schizophrenia have focused on the role that social motivation, including social reward processing, has on overall social functioning.<sup><a href=""#CIT0002"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0002"">2</a></sup> Because of the social withdrawal symptoms, it was assumed that individuals with schizophrenia lacked interest in social relationships (eg, social anhedonia).

Hence, studies of social motivation and effort (see Catalano and Green, this issue) concentrate on what schizophrenia patients are willing to do to engage socially and how this impacts social behavior.</p>"
"<p>Because social function is associated with overall functional outcome and the target of behavioral and pharmacological treatments, there have been several approaches to modeling impaired social functioning in schizophrenia in laboratory animals. Here we review models that manipulate the social environment through experimenter-induced social isolation and discuss how these models may be relevant to the neural circuitry and clinical course of schizophrenia. We then discuss preclinical measures of social behavior and how these may be improved to more accurately probe social motivation relevant to schizophrenia.</p>"
"<p>Because social interaction is essential for pair bonding, parental care, and cooperation across species, failure to engage in appropriate social interactions across developmental stages can be detrimental to the organism. Schizophrenia patients experience isolation, both self-imposed (withdrawal) and as a social reaction to their symptoms and functional impairment. In retrospective and prospective studies, social isolation is a nonspecific symptom early in the course of schizophrenia<sup><a href=""#CIT0015"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0015"">15</a>,<a href=""#CIT0016"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0016"">16</a></sup>—often predating other overt symptoms of psychosis<sup><a href=""#CIT0017"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0017"">17</a></sup>—and is found in individuals carrying a genetic risk for schizophrenia.<sup><a href=""#CIT0018"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0018"">18</a>,<a href=""#CIT0019"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0019"">19</a></sup> Social withdrawal and isolation increase disease risk and conversion to psychosis in prodromal patients.<sup><a href=""#CIT0020"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0020"">20</a>,<a href=""#CIT0021"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0021"">21</a></sup> The “social deafferentation hypothesis” asserts that social withdrawal is causal to the development of psychosis in at-risk individuals.<sup><a href=""#CIT0022"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0022"">22</a></sup> Indeed, social functioning, among other factors, predicts conversion to psychosis in clinical high-risk individuals.<sup><a href=""#CIT0023"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0023"">23</a>,<a href=""#CIT0024"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0024"">24</a></sup> Conversely, therapies that strengthen social skills enhance function in schizophrenia patients.<sup><a href=""#CIT0025"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0025"">25</a></sup> The close convergence between the internal experience of isolation and the content of psychosis is evident in the fact that loneliness accompanying social withdrawal in schizophrenia is associated with social-based hallucinations (eg, hearing voices, hearing laughter, and feeling of being touched), but not nonsocial hallucinations (eg, hearing music or environmental sounds, seeing animals, and feeling of something crawling on skin).<sup><a href=""#CIT0026"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0026"">26</a></sup></p>"
"<p>While direct evidence is lacking, it seems likely that the causal relationship between social isolation and brain dysfunction in schizophrenia is bidirectional. The specific impact of early social isolation/withdrawal on the development of neural circuit abnormalities in schizophrenia, and the mechanisms underlying this impact, are not yet fully understood. We hypothesized that social isolation/withdrawal may impact neural circuit function via multiple pathways,<sup><a href=""#CIT0027"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0027"">27</a></sup> eg, <em>direct, indirect, and feed-forward</em>. A <em>direct</em> influence may reflect the fact that neural circuitry is plastic and shaped by environmental context early in development. Just as early life sensory deprivation or modification impacts the development of circuits that process and organize sensory information,<sup><a href=""#CIT0028"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0028"">28</a></sup> circuitry that normally regulates social behavior and motivation—and associated higher cognitive processes—will likely be negatively impacted by an environment with deficient or dysfunctional social stimulation. Adolescence appears to be a critical period for plasticity in “social circuitry.” Thus, the social manifestations of early psychosis might have <em>direct</em> adverse neurobiological consequences, through the loss of normal, neurostimulatory social cues and interactions.</p>"
"<p>We further hypothesized that social isolation/withdrawal can <em>indirectly</em> influence neural circuitry in schizophrenia by triggering stress-mediated inflammatory mechanisms that adversely impact development of brain circuits (<a href=""#F1"" class=""usa-link"">figure 1</a>;<sup><a href=""#CIT0027"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0027"">27</a></sup>). Potential mechanisms for these pathological processes are discussed below. There are also lasting effects of clinical sequelae, ranging from paranoia to deficits in social behavior; these sequelae can sustain social isolation through the adult course of schizophrenia and create <em>“feed-forward” effects</em> on both the environmental and stress-mediated contributors, which in turn may extend circuit dysfunction. Studies have investigated these and other hypothesized pathways from social isolation/withdrawal to neural circuit dysfunction in preclinical models such as social isolation rearing (SIR) of rats.</p>"

"<p>Hypothesized role of social isolation in the developmental pathophysiology of schizophrenia. A hypothetical framework for proposed pathways by which social isolation exerts its effects on neural circuits and, conversely, how cognitive deficits, functional impairments, and peer/social rejection contribute to social isolation. This framework suggests that psychosocial adversity during early life can affect neural circuits (1) directly, (2) indirectly by triggering chronic stress cascades, and (3) be a consequence of the functional impairment resulting from premorbid social cognitive and/or social motivation deficits in mental illness, creating a feed-forward effect. In preclinical studies of social isolation rearing (SIR), the downstream effects of experimenter-induced social isolation and withdrawal (gray-shaded box) are investigated.</p>"
"<p>Social interactions in rats in both the wild and in the laboratory are complex and robust. Rats display amicable social behavior such as huddling and rough and tumble play (for a more extensive review of rodent social behavior see<sup><a href=""#CIT0029"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0029"">29</a></sup>). In SIR, post-weanling rats are raised to adulthood in single-housed cages, absent from social contact with other rats. This environmental manipulation has profound and enduring effects on behavior, immune function, and brain development. The process of raising post-weanling animals in single-housed, “isolated” conditions deprives them of social interactions during the critical early-life period in which play behavior emerges.<sup><a href=""#CIT0030"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0030"">30</a></sup> Social play (eg pinning, pouncing, following, and wrestling) is normally regulated by, and helps shape, coordinated interactions within limbic and mesolimbic circuitry<sup><a href=""#CIT0031"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0031"">31</a>,<a href=""#CIT0032"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0032"">32</a></sup>; the disruption of these interactions via SIR can disturb normal development of mechanisms central to reward processing. Some long-term disturbances in brain function and behavior that emerge after SIR can be traced to dysfunction in limbic and mesolimbic circuitry (discussed below), and reproduce abnormalities exhibited in developmentally linked brain disorders such as schizophrenia.<sup><a href=""#CIT0033"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0033"">33</a>,<a href=""#CIT0034"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0034"">34</a></sup></p>"
"<p>In the SIR paradigm, social isolation is imposed on a “neurotypical” animal via restrictive housing, rather than being—as described above—a manifestation of early psychosis and the resulting pathological engagement with the surrounding social structure. One clear consequence of SIR is the loss of sensory cues associated with social interactions, that are critical to normal behavioral and neurobiological development (reviewed in<sup><a href=""#CIT0035"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0035"">35</a></sup>). We might expect different neurobiological consequences of <em>absent social cues</em> and interactions on a “neurotypical” brain, in the case of SIR, vs. <em>dysfunctional social interactions</em> on a brain predisposed to pathology, in the case of emergent psychosis. Nonetheless, to the degree that experimentally- and symptomatically imposed social isolation both result in the loss of normal social environmental stimuli and contexts (eg, social cues and reinforcement), SIR might inform us about the potentially life-long neural and behavioral consequences of deprivation from social engagement.</p>"
"<p>In addition to depriving developing rodents of social stimuli, SIR also exposes developing rodents to a chronic stressor. Sustained early life stress is implicated as a predisposing factor in schizophrenia and other brain disorders. Chronic stress-induced immune/inflammatory activation might provide the “second hit”—ie, in predisposed individuals, have direct and indirect neurotoxic effects that disrupt the formation of specific neural circuits and thereby promote the conversion to psychosis. SIR is associated with stress-related neurotoxicity, and specific candidate molecular mechanisms for these effects are reviewed below. By studying mechanisms and neural targets of SIR-induced immune/inflammatory activation, we might identify biomarkers for psychosis risk, and neuroprotective interventions that could be applied to biomarker-identified vulnerable individuals, to reduce the neural consequences of stress associated with early social dysfunction.</p>"
"<p>An obvious caveat in this reasoning is that “not all stress is alike.” Stress associated with single housing is different, both experientially and biologically, from stress associated with aberrant social contacts—ranging from perceived social slights and rejection, to sustained fear states associated with paranoia, to repeated social defeat—that may accompany the emergence of psychosis in humans. Thus, the neurobiological consequences of SIR almost certainly do not precisely reproduce those that characterize pathological social engagement in presymptomatic or prodromal schizophrenia. Like other preclinical models, SIR sacrifices homology with the complex human biology, but offers the advantage that the experimenter can control and manipulate variables to test mechanistic hypotheses.</p>"
"<p>By controlling the timing of social isolation in SIR, it is possible to investigate “critical periods” for the impact of social isolation on brain and behavior (eg,<sup><a href=""#CIT0036"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0036"">36</a>,<a href=""#CIT0037"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0037"">37</a></sup>), and to track into adulthood the sustained and potentially life-long behavioral and neurobiological deficits imparted by early life isolation. Less studied in SIR-related models are the sustained effects of chronic adult isolation on behavior and brain function. Thus, in adult humans with schizophrenia, social isolation is often perpetuated as a consequence of impaired social cognition, thought disorder, disorganized speech and behavior, and profound functional impairment. As in the early phases of psychosis, these sustained manifestations produce isolation both directly (individuals avoid social interactions) and indirectly (via peer/social/societal rejection).</p>"
"<p>Within this theoretical framework (<a href=""#F1"" class=""usa-link"">figure 1</a>), three pathways—isolation-induced loss of neurostimulation, isolation stress-induced neurotoxicity, and sustained isolating effects of the symptomatic manifestations of schizophrenia in adulthood—might converge at multiple levels. For example, social dysfunction early in life can (1) reflect premorbid social cognitive deficits of an evolving schizophrenia that then (2) trigger stress-mediated cascades injurious to vulnerable neural substrates in at-risk individuals, and thereby (3) produce clinical manifestations that contribute to sustained isolation and social withdrawal throughout adulthood. SIR allows us to model some elements of these convergent pathways, and in the process has identified neural changes that may be relevant to the biology of social isolation in schizophrenia.</p>"
"<p>SIR rats exhibit profound differences in behavior, pharmacologic sensitivity, and neurochemistry compared to socially reared rats (cf.<sup><a href=""#CIT0027"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0027"">27</a>,<a href=""#CIT0034"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0034"">34</a>,<a href=""#CIT0035"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0035"">35</a>,<a href=""#CIT0038"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0038"">38</a>,<a href=""#CIT0039"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0039"">39</a></sup>). Though some discrepant findings across studies may reflect different methods (timing, housing conditions, etc.) of SIR, studies most commonly identify evidence for dopamine hyperreactivity: (1) elevated behavioral sensitivity to dopamine agonists,<sup><a href=""#CIT0040"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0040"">40–43</a></sup> (2) reduced sensitivity to dopamine antagonists,<sup><a href=""#CIT0044"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0044"">44</a></sup> (3) elevated basal and amphetamine-stimulated dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens and/or dorsal striatum,<sup><a href=""#CIT0041"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0041"">41</a>,<a href=""#CIT0045"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0045"">45–48</a></sup> (4) elevated dopamine concentrations<sup><a href=""#CIT0041"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0041"">41</a></sup> and altered dopamine turnover<sup><a href=""#CIT0049"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0049"">49</a></sup> in the frontal cortex, and (5) increased electrophysiological activity of dopamine neurons.<sup><a href=""#CIT0050"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0050"">50</a></sup> While SIR is most associated with hypersensitivity to drugs acting to enhance <em>presynaptic</em> dopamine function (eg, amphetamine, cocaine), findings of enhanced response to direct dopamine receptor agonists prompted Sahakian et al.<sup><a href=""#CIT0043"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0043"">43</a></sup> to comment “that the increasing activity of the DA system [after social isolation] is both pre- and postsynaptic in nature” (but see<sup><a href=""#CIT0051"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0051"">51</a></sup>).</p>"

"<p>A behavioral measure studied extensively in SIR rats is prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle (PPI), an operational measure of sensorimotor gating. In PPI, a weak prepulse inhibits the magnitude of startle to an intense, abrupt “pulse,” typically delivered 30–240 miliseconds later. PPI is studied across several species using stimulus parameters and equipment for stimulus delivery and response acquisition that closely approximate those used in humans (cf.<sup><a href=""#CIT0114"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0114"">114</a></sup>).</p>"
"<p>One reason that PPI has been studied so extensively across species is that Braff et al.<sup><a href=""#CIT0115"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0115"">115</a></sup> reported that schizophrenia patients exhibited deficient PPI, an effect reported in over 40 PubMed reports<sup><a href=""#CIT0038"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0038"">38</a></sup> (cf.,<sup><a href=""#CIT0116"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0116"">116</a></sup>). Reduced PPI is not specific to schizophrenia: It is also deficient in a number of other neuropsychiatric disorders (cf.<sup><a href=""#CIT0117"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0117"">117</a></sup>). Nonetheless, PPI deficits in schizophrenia are perhaps those most studied: They are quantitative, highly heritable,<sup><a href=""#CIT0118"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0118"">118</a></sup> associated with specific genes,<sup><a href=""#CIT0119"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0119"">119</a>,<a href=""#CIT0120"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0120"">120</a></sup> sensitive to second-generation antipsychotics,<sup><a href=""#CIT0121"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0121"">121</a>,<a href=""#CIT0122"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0122"">122</a></sup> and related to global function in these patients.<sup><a href=""#CIT0121"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0121"">121</a></sup> Because PPI is highly conserved across species and can be studied in humans and rodents using methods that are nearly homologous, it has been possible to use measures in rodents to understand the biology of PPI and its deficits in schizophrenia and other disorders. For example, it is possible to demonstrate that specific early developmental perturbations in rats can reproduce a schizophrenia “phenotype” (deficient PPI). In some cases—as with SIR<sup><a href=""#CIT0123"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0123"">123</a></sup> and maternal immune activation<sup><a href=""#CIT0124"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0124"">124</a></sup>—the biological impact of the perturbation can be quite broad, and despite this, the basis for the resulting PPI deficits can be localized within the brain. This makes it possible to identify candidate neural substrates for a quantitative behavioral disturbance in schizophrenia. It also makes it possible to use PPI deficits to screen for novel treatments.

"<p>Since Geyer et al.’s<sup><a href=""#CIT0033"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0033"">33</a></sup> first report that SIR rats show deficits in PPI, this finding has been reproduced by many groups.<sup><a href=""#CIT0125"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0125"">125</a>,<a href=""#CIT0127"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0127"">127</a>,<a href=""#CIT0129"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0129"">129–133</a></sup> These “replications have not reported uniformly robust SIR-induced PPI deficits: In fact, it is clear that the PPI-reducing effects of SIR are “fragile,”<sup><a href=""#CIT0134"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0134"">134</a></sup> with paradigmatic differences across studies that impact the magnitude and consistency of SIR-induced PPI deficits. The longitudinal and labor-intensive nature of the SIR paradigm makes it difficult to conduct controlled, parametric analyses to understand the variability of PPI deficits after SIR. The difficulty in consistently reproducing SIR-induced PPI deficits across laboratories parallels difficulties seen with other developmental models of relevance to schizophrenia, such as prenatal stress, maternal immune activation, and maternal toxins (eg, methylazoxymethanol acetate, MAM).<sup><a href=""#CIT0039"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0039"">39</a></sup></p>"

Similar to drug-induced CPP, social CPP involves associating environmental stimuli (eg, bedding) with either a social environment or isolation (<a href=""#F2"" class=""usa-link"">figure 2C</a>). Social CPP is deficient in DISC1-Q31L mutant mice<sup><a href=""#CIT0182"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0182"">182</a>,<a href=""#CIT0183"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0183"">183</a></sup> and is mediated in part by oxytocin in the nucleus accumbens<sup><a href=""#CIT0142"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0142"">142</a></sup> and ventral tegmentum.<sup><a href=""#CIT0184"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0184"">184</a></sup> Acute oxytocin induces a CPP and facilitates social CPP in female mice.<sup><a href=""#CIT0185"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0185"">185</a></sup> In rats, social CPP is reduced by adolescent subchronic phencyclidine exposure but not neonatal ventral hippocampal lesions.<sup><a href=""#CIT0186"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0186"">186</a></sup> Interestingly, adolescent isolation is associated with increased social CPP.<sup><a href=""#CIT0187"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0187"">187</a></sup> Social CPP is highly variable and requires large samples to observe differences in place preference. Additionally, preference is driven largely by the most proximal housing condition, ie, mice display stronger preference for the social bedding immediately after being housed in the isolate condition and weaker preference immediately after social housing. Lastly, most mice tested in social CPP show only small preferences for the socially paired condition.</p>"

"<p>Tests of social behavior in rodents. (A) Reciprocal social interaction test. Social interaction between rodents, typically rats, are scored when a test animal is exposed to a novel partner animal. Behaviors scored include sniffing, following, pouncing, pinning, attack, etc. (B) 3-chamber test. In the 3-chamber test, the stimulus animal is allowed to freely explore the arena; whereas, the partner animal is enclosed in an inverted pencil cup. Top panel: Phase 1, Sociability test. Bottom panel: Phase 2, social recognition. Primary measures in the task include frequency and duration of investigation (eg, sniffing within 2 cm), time spent in each chamber, and a ratio of time spent exploring stranger 1 vs. empty cup or stranger 2 vs. stranger 1. (C) Social Conditioned Place Preference. Primary measures include the amount of time spent in the chamber with cues (eg, bedding) previously paired with isolation vs. social housing conditions. (D) Operant Effort-based Social Motivation Task. Example of an effort-based social motivation task in which rats or mice are trained to lever press for access to a partner animal. Primary outcome measures include number of rewards, number of lever presses for food vs. social reward, and preference score. Panels A, B, and D were created with BioRender.com.</p>"
"<p>The tasks reviewed in the previous section measure certain aspects of social motivation. For example, in the 3-chambered task, a preference for the social stimulus over the object suggests a higher motivation to interact with the social stimulus. Similarly, social CPP involves a choice between a chamber previously paired with social stimuli vs isolation. Neither task, however, quantifies <em>effort</em> to interact with the conspecific.</p>"
"<p>Several laboratories are starting to measure social effort in operant-based tasks (<a href=""#F2"" class=""usa-link"">figure 2D</a>). For example, Borland and colleagues designed an operant task in hamsters to quantify social motivation “effort.” In this task, male Syrian hamsters open weighted swinging doors to access a same-sex smaller hamster or an empty compartment.<sup><a href=""#CIT0188"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0188"">188</a></sup> Hamsters acquire a preference for the social interaction chamber over the empty chamber and increase their effort with incremental weights added to the door.<sup><a href=""#CIT0188"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0188"">188</a></sup> Social interaction in the task was more rewarding in female hamsters, and social reward was blocked by oxytocin receptor antagonists in the ventral tegmentum.<sup><a href=""#CIT0189"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0189"">189</a></sup></p>"
"<p>To demonstrate social motivation, tasks should control for the novelty of social access, require increasing effort to engage with social stimuli, and compare choices between social stimuli and another reward (eg, food or drugs). To address these aspects of effort-based decision-making, investigators have modified operant self-administration chambers in mice<sup><a href=""#CIT0141"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0141"">141</a>,<a href=""#CIT0190"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0190"">190</a></sup> and rats<sup><a href=""#CIT0191"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0191"">191–195</a></sup> to conduct parametric evaluations of effort to engage with a partner animal.</p>"
"<p>Male and female rats readily learn to lever press for access to a same-sex rat when tested under conditions similar to drug self-administration.<sup><a href=""#CIT0193"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0193"">193–195</a></sup> To demonstrate effort for social reward, rats must increase lever presses and choose between social or food rewards.<sup><a href=""#CIT0192"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0192"">192</a></sup> Social reward is greater after brief single housing and when exposed to a familiar vs. unfamiliar partner rat<sup><a href=""#CIT0192"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0192"">192</a></sup> and is preferred to drug reward (eg, methamphetamine, heroin).<sup><a href=""#CIT0195"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0195"">195</a></sup> Recent studies have trained mice in a similar task and evaluated differences based on sex and mouse strain.<sup><a href=""#CIT0141"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0141"">141</a>,<a href=""#CIT0190"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0190"">190</a></sup> Inbred C57 mice, which are used for most genetic mutation studies, were compared to outbred CD1 mice, which are often used in drug and genetic studies. Female CD1s acquired “social self-administration” to a greater extent than female C57s; whereas, male C57s showed minimal social self-administration.<sup><a href=""#CIT0141"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0141"">141</a></sup> In another study, however, C57 mice more readily acquire lever pressing for social reward and have a higher breakpoint compared to BTBR mice—a strain showing social deficits in other tasks.<sup><a href=""#CIT0196"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0196"">196</a></sup> Hence, strain and sex differences are apparent in operant social motivation tasks. Studies have begun to examine neural circuits and pharmacological manipulations. For example, GABAergic neurons in the medial amygdala were essential for social reward in an operant social motivation task.<sup><a href=""#CIT0197"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0197"">197</a></sup></p>"
"<p>Taken together, rats, mice, and hamsters can perform effort-based social motivation tasks with differences in performance and strength of preference across strain, sex, and species. Whether these effort-based social motivation tasks will provide better translational models for treatments targeting social motivation deficits in schizophrenia is an open question.</p>"
"<p>While experimenter-imposed social isolation provides a viable experimental model for understanding some biological mechanisms linking social dysfunction to clinical and neural pathology in schizophrenia, it bypasses critical antecedents to social isolation in schizophrenia, notably deficits in social reward and social motivation. Recent efforts at modeling social motivation using effort-based tasks in rodents have the potential to quantify these antecedents. By testing social motivation in etiology- or construct-based rodent models (eg, genetic, neurodevelopmental), we may begin to address whether deficits in social motivation accompany brain and behavioral changes similar to those produced by experimenter-induced social isolation (eg, SIR), and which reproduce pathological changes associated with schizophrenia. This approach would allow us to test hypotheses regarding the indirect effects of stress or inflammation on social motivation and subsequent behavioral sequalae resulting from social isolation. Deciphering the mechanistic role of social motivation deficits in rodent models for schizophrenia will be challenging. Standard rodent housing does not allow for physical isolation from cage mates; thus, housing would need to be modified to allow for physical isolation and longitudinal assessment. Advances in automated tracking technology and advances in incorporating naturalistic motivation tasks into caging systems may allow for detailed mechanistic studies.</p>"
"<p>For example, rats with neonatal ventral hippocampal lesions show deficits in social interaction<sup><a href=""#CIT0198"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0198"">198</a></sup> as well as cognitive deficits (eg, procedural memory)<sup><a href=""#CIT0199"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0199"">199</a></sup> and neuropathological changes relevant to schizophrenia.<sup><a href=""#CIT0200"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0200"">200</a></sup> The extent to which deficits in social motivation contribute to cognitive deficits in the model is not known. Experiments could define the time course of social motivation deficits in rats with neonatal ventral hippocampal lesions and determine whether improving social motivation in the model will ameliorate or prevent cognitive deficits.</p>"
"<p>Ultimately, the goal of preclinical studies is to develop new treatments for symptoms of schizophrenia. A recent meta-analysis of treatments for social deficits in rodent models relevant to schizophrenia explored the preclinical evaluation of potential treatments for negative symptoms of schizophrenia.<sup><a href=""#CIT0201"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0201"">201</a></sup> The meta-analysis revealed that pharmacological efficacy on social deficits was dependent on the model chosen, with larger effect sizes in neurodevelopmental, perinatal, and adult pharmacological models. Pharmacological treatments showing the largest effects were atypical antipsychotics, along with several other candidates including stimulants, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, vasodilators, and new antipsychotics.<sup><a href=""#CIT0201"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CIT0201"">201</a></sup> To specifically target social motivation deficits, we recommend new drug treatments be evaluated in operant effort-based social motivation tasks. Since similar effort-based social motivation tasks can be conducted in humans, they may be better suited for translational pharmacological studies across species.</p>"
"<p>Although preclinical studies of social motivation and social isolation can be useful for neural circuitry studies and drug development, there are obvious limitations to the translational potential of such studies due to species differences in social behavior. While some of the basic functions of social interactions are similar across species (eg, pair bonding, cooperation), there are unique features of human social behavior that are distinct from rodents. Hence, rodent studies should be considered in the context of non-human primate and human laboratory-based studies of social motivation.</p>"

"<p id=""Par1"">Previous research suggests an association of loneliness and social isolation (LNL-ISO) with schizophrenia. Here, we demonstrate a LNL-ISO polygenic score contribution to schizophrenia risk in an independent case-control sample (N = 3,488). We then subset schizophrenia predisposing variation based on its effect on LNL-ISO. We find that genetic variation with concordant effects in both phenotypes shows significant SNP-based heritability enrichment, higher polygenic contribution in females, and positive covariance with mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, alcohol dependence, and autism. Conversely, genetic variation with discordant effects only contributes to schizophrenia risk in males and is negatively correlated with those disorders. Mendelian randomization analyses demonstrate a plausible bi-directional causal relationship between LNL-ISO and schizophrenia, with a greater effect of LNL-ISO liability on schizophrenia than vice versa. These results illustrate the genetic footprint of LNL-ISO on schizophrenia.</p>"

"<p id=""Par3"">Social relationships are critical for emotional and cognitive development in social species<sup><a href=""#CR1"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR1"">1</a>,<a href=""#CR2"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR2"">2</a></sup>. In fact, the scientific consensus is that the need to belong to a social group is a fundamental behaviour in humans<sup><a href=""#CR3"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR3"">3</a></sup>. Researchers have characterized both objective and perceived (i.e., loneliness) social isolation<sup><a href=""#CR4"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR4"">4</a>,<a href=""#CR5"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR5"">5</a></sup>. While the former is an objective lack of social connections (interactions, contacts or relationships), the latter refers to the subjective feeling of distress associated with a lack of meaningful relationships, regardless of the amount of social contact<sup><a href=""#CR6"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR6"">6</a></sup>. Although isolated people often feel lonely, isolation is not always correlated with feelings of loneliness<sup><a href=""#CR4"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR4"">4</a>–<a href=""#CR6"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR6"">6</a></sup>. However, regardless of type, both objective social isolation and loneliness are major risk factors for morbidity and mortality<sup><a href=""#CR6"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR6"">6</a>–<a href=""#CR8"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR8"">8</a></sup>, as well as for the onset of mental disorders<sup><a href=""#CR9"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR9"">9</a>–<a href=""#CR14"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR14"">14</a></sup>.</p>"
"<p id=""Par4"">Most psychiatric research on loneliness and objective social isolation has associated them with depressive symptoms and major depression<sup><a href=""#CR14"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR14"">14</a>–<a href=""#CR16"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR16"">16</a></sup>, but recently researchers have shown renewed interest in their association with psychosis<sup><a href=""#CR17"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR17"">17</a>–<a href=""#CR20"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR20"">20</a></sup>. Social withdrawal and isolation are described in the early stages of schizophrenia<sup><a href=""#CR17"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR17"">17</a>,<a href=""#CR21"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR21"">21</a>,<a href=""#CR22"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR22"">22</a></sup>, recalling the classical descriptions of pre-schizophrenia related traits by Kraepelin, Bleuler, and Conrad<sup><a href=""#CR23"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR23"">23</a>–<a href=""#CR25"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR25"">25</a></sup>. Indeed, recent meta-analyses indicate that loneliness plays an important role in the onset and maintenance of psychotic symptoms<sup><a href=""#CR17"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR17"">17</a>,<a href=""#CR22"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR22"">22</a>,<a href=""#CR26"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR26"">26</a></sup>. Another meta-analysis also showed a consistent association of loneliness with both positive and negative psychotic-like experiences<sup><a href=""#CR27"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR27"">27</a></sup>. Moreover, there are studies suggesting that loneliness may increase subclinical paranoia in non-clinical populations<sup><a href=""#CR28"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR28"">28</a></sup>. However, the causal relationships between social isolation and schizophrenia are still unclear<sup><a href=""#CR17"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR17"">17</a>,<a href=""#CR29"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR29"">29</a></sup>.</p>"
"<p id=""Par5"">Inherited biological factors could explain, at least partially, the relationship between social isolation and schizophrenia. Available evidence supports the genetic basis of loneliness and objective social isolation<sup><a href=""#CR30"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR30"">30</a>–<a href=""#CR33"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR33"">33</a></sup>. A recent study used multi-trait GWAS (MTAG)<sup><a href=""#CR34"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR34"">34</a></sup>, a software developed to jointly analyse different summary statistics from related traits, to assess the genetic architecture of loneliness and objective social isolation (LNL-ISO)<sup><a href=""#CR32"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR32"">32</a></sup>. The researchers combined three UK Biobank GWAS datasets of (i) perceived loneliness, (ii) a proxy of social support (combined frequency of family/friends visits and living alone), and (iii) ability to confide in someone close<sup><a href=""#CR32"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR32"">32</a></sup>. Up to 15 genome-wide significant <em>loci</em> and SNP-based heritability estimates (<em>h</em><sup><em>2</em></sup><sub><em>SNP</em></sub> = 4.2%) support the contribution of common genetic variation to this social construct. This study also found a significant genetic correlation of the combined phenotype (LNL-ISO) with schizophrenia (<em>r</em>g = 0.17, <em>p</em> = 3.47 × 10<sup>−12</sup>), consistent with a previous study reporting a significant association of perceived loneliness with schizophrenia, but not with bipolar disorder<sup><a href=""#CR33"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR33"">33</a></sup>. Schizophrenia polygenic scores also significantly predicted loneliness in an independent population sample in another study<sup><a href=""#CR35"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR35"">35</a></sup>, lending further support to a shared genetic aetiology between both phenotypes.</p>"
"<p id=""Par6"">Previous studies exploring the genetic relationship between perceived and objective social isolation and schizophrenia leave several questions unanswered, including the direction of the association, the specific biological effects of shared and non-shared predisposing variants, and the effect of additional factors on this relationship, including sex. The epidemiological and clinical presentation of psychotic disorders differs between sexes<sup><a href=""#CR36"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR36"">36</a>–<a href=""#CR38"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR38"">38</a></sup> and sex also seems to affect the perception of loneliness and the psychological impact of isolation, although results have been contradictory so far<sup><a href=""#CR39"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR39"">39</a>–<a href=""#CR41"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR41"">41</a></sup>.</p>"
"<p id=""Par7"">In this work, we aim to test the hypothesis that there is a bidirectional genetic relationship between perceived and objective social isolation and schizophrenia within a systematic and comprehensive framework (see the workflow in Fig. <a href=""#Fig1"" class=""usa-link"">1</a>). First, we analyse loneliness and social isolation (LNL-ISO) polygenic score contribution to schizophrenia risk in an independent Spanish case-control sample (CIBERSAM case-control sample). Second, we dissect the predisposing variation to schizophrenia according to its role in LNL-ISO and analyse the polygenic risk scores, biological profiles (using brain specific functional annotations), and sex effects across each genomic partition using an SNP subsetting approach. Third, to evaluate the role of LNL-ISO in the genetic overlap between psychiatric disorders and other related traits, we study the partial correlations between schizophrenia and related phenotypes across the LNL-ISO partitions. Finally, we perform a causality analysis between LNL-ISO and schizophrenia using a two-sample Mendelian randomization approach.</p>"

Although we did not detect horizontal pleiotropy with the MR-Egger intercept analysis (<em>p</em> = 0.36), there was evidence of heterogeneity (IVW <em>Q</em>-<em>p</em>-value = 2.94 × 10<sup>−6</sup>) (Table <a href=""#Tab1"" class=""usa-link"">1</a>, Supplementary Fig. <a href=""#MOESM1"" class=""usa-link"">5</a>).

"<p id=""Par21"">This work suggests the presence of genetic overlap between social isolation, measured using LNL-ISO, and schizophrenia, with a bidirectional causal relationship. We found that overlapping predisposing genetic variation with concordant effects in both phenotypes shows significant SNP-based heritability enrichment, supporting the relatively enhanced contribution of this set of variants to schizophrenia liability. We found the concordant variation to contribute more to schizophrenia risk in females and to be positively correlated with other neuropsychiatric traits. Conversely, discordant variation contributed to schizophrenia risk only in males and was negatively correlated with most neuropsychiatric traits. These results reveal the likely genomic footprint of social isolation on the heritability of schizophrenia and provide new insights about their relationship<sup><a href=""#CR32"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR32"">32</a>,<a href=""#CR35"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR35"">35</a></sup>. They also support the role of LNL-ISO as a critical social trait for understanding the heterogeneity of pleiotropic genetic effects between schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders and behavioural traits. In fact, each of the individual traits included in the composite LNL-ISO phenotype had a significant polygenic score contribution to schizophrenia risk. These results agree with separate findings of a clinical overlap between schizophrenia and both perceived loneliness and objective social disconnection and support the idea that social isolation may play a significant role in the aetiology of psychotic disorders<sup><a href=""#CR17"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR17"">17</a>,<a href=""#CR19"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR19"">19</a>,<a href=""#CR20"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR20"">20</a>,<a href=""#CR27"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR27"">27</a></sup>.</p>"
"<p id=""Par22"">Researchers have described polygenic score predictions and LD-score-based partition heritability estimates as powerful methods for evaluating the effects of genetic predisposing variation within specific subsets of variants<sup><a href=""#CR51"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR51"">51</a>–<a href=""#CR53"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR53"">53</a></sup>. With 3.8% of SNPs explaining an estimated 13.1% of SNP-based heritability, concordant overlapping variation between both phenotypes exhibits more than a three-fold increase in heritability enrichment compared to variants not predisposing to LNL-ISO, and a much higher enrichment than most of the genome-wide annotations previously evaluated in schizophrenia<sup><a href=""#CR54"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR54"">54</a></sup>. LDSC-SEG analyses pointed to a significant enrichment at the uncorrected level of concordant overlapping variation in the hippocampus, a brain region involved in social behaviour<sup><a href=""#CR55"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR55"">55</a>,<a href=""#CR56"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR56"">56</a></sup> and cognitive flexibility<sup><a href=""#CR57"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR57"">57</a></sup>, which may be especially sensitive to brain inflammation caused by loneliness and isolation<sup><a href=""#CR10"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR10"">10</a>,<a href=""#CR56"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR56"">56</a></sup>.

By analysing the genomic overlap between schizophrenia and LNL-ISO, we did observe a differential effect of sex on polygenic contributions to schizophrenia risk. Concordant overlapping variants in SCZ and LNL-ISO accounted for a significantly greater amount of variance in schizophrenia risk in females than in males, while the opposite pattern was observed in the rest of LNL-ISO based annotations. These results are in line with recent studies suggesting a potentially higher impact of loneliness and objective social isolation on psychiatric outcomes in females than in males<sup><a href=""#CR26"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR26"">26</a>,<a href=""#CR41"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR41"">41</a></sup>. This may be due to a more negative perception of social deprivation in females related to their role in modern society<sup><a href=""#CR61"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR61"">61</a></sup> and a greater protective effect of an enriched social network in males<sup><a href=""#CR62"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR62"">62</a></sup>. Moreover, among patients with schizophrenia, loneliness has been described to be more prevalent in females than males<sup><a href=""#CR63"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR63"">63</a></sup>. Our results suggest the existence of a social-related environment differentially affecting males and females that could be, at least in part, responsible for the different sex-stratified PGS contributions.

In the majority of the disorders, schizophrenia is positively correlated within concordant overlapping variation and negatively correlated within discordant overlapping variation with LNL-ISO, thus pointing to a shared genetic impact of social isolation on comorbidity with these disorders. However, OCD and BIP have positively correlated with schizophrenia regardless of LNL-ISO based annotations, thus suggesting that the association of these disorders with schizophrenia is independent of the genetic predisposition to LNL-ISO. These results are in line with recent findings suggesting that schizophrenia, BIP, and OCD could belong to the same psychopathology factor at the genomic level<sup><a href=""#CR69"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR69"">69</a></sup>.</p>"

Our findings suggest that poor educational attainment often found in young patients with schizophrenia<sup><a href=""#CR72"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR72"">72</a>,<a href=""#CR73"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR73"">73</a></sup> could be mediated by social isolation.</p>"
"<p id=""Par26"">Mendelian randomization analyses provided evidence of the bidirectional nature of the causal relationship between loneliness and isolation and schizophrenia liability, with greater size of the effect of LNL-ISO on schizophrenia risk than in the opposite direction. This finding of bidirectional causality between social isolation and schizophrenia was confirmed with the recently developed method CAUSE, which provides better control for correlated and uncorrelated horizontal pleiotropy<sup><a href=""#CR49"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR49"">49</a></sup>. Our results are consistent with previous evidence suggesting that loneliness and objective social isolation could trigger both positive and negative psychotic symptoms in clinical and non-clinical populations<sup><a href=""#CR17"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR17"">17</a>,<a href=""#CR27"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR27"">27</a></sup>. It could also explain the high levels of loneliness and isolation before the onset of psychosis in individuals at clinical high risk for psychosis<sup><a href=""#CR74"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR74"">74</a></sup>. On the other hand, the described effect of schizophrenia liability on social isolation could also give an explanation to the high prevalence of loneliness in the chronic stages of psychotic illnesses<sup><a href=""#CR17"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR17"">17</a>,<a href=""#CR20"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR20"">20</a>,<a href=""#CR26"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR26"">26</a></sup>.</p>"
"<p id=""Par27"">Causal inferences assessing the relationships between LNL-ISO constituents and schizophrenia also found a unidirectional negative causal effect of “ability to confide” on schizophrenia, in line with recent studies describing the association of lack of confidence and loneliness with psychosis, which may be mediated by negative schemata of others<sup><a href=""#CR29"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR29"">29</a>,<a href=""#CR75"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR75"">75</a></sup>. Moreover, a unidirectional negative causal effect of schizophrenia liability on the “number of people living in your household” was found, thus suggesting a possible indirect causal effect of schizophrenia genetic liability on subsequent social disconnection in participants diagnosed with schizophrenia<sup><a href=""#CR18"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR18"">18</a></sup>. This relationship is also reinforced with the significant polygenic contribution of both phenotypes to schizophrenia risk (Fig. <a href=""#Fig2"" class=""usa-link"">2A</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""Par28"">Previous studies assessing social determinants of poor mental health have evaluated the association of social disadvantage and their genetic determinants with the risk of psychosis<sup><a href=""#CR76"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR76"">76</a>,<a href=""#CR77"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR77"">77</a></sup>. Our study adds to this previous evidence by incorporating a subjective perception to social dysfunction in psychosis from a genetic perspective. Further studies should explore the effect of subjective perception of loneliness and its association with the social defeat hypothesis with the risk of psychosis<sup><a href=""#CR76"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR76"">76</a></sup>.</p>"
"<p id=""Par29"">Our study was subject to several limitations. First, we used measures of loneliness and objective social isolation from the UKBB, which are based on single-question questionnaires and not on validated scales such as UCLA loneliness<sup><a href=""#CR78"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR78"">78</a></sup>. Nevertheless, multiple research studies have previously validated binary self-reported loneliness questionnaires and found strong convergent validity with UCLA loneliness scale<sup><a href=""#CR1"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR1"">1</a>,<a href=""#CR58"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR58"">58</a>,<a href=""#CR78"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR78"">78</a></sup>. Second, since we used discovery samples for polygenic score analysis from the UKBB population, socio-economic biases could have affected our genetic predictions to some extent<sup><a href=""#CR79"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR79"">79</a>,<a href=""#CR80"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR80"">80</a></sup>. Third, partitioning the genome in order to estimate heritability enrichment in a reduced subset of SNP may have underpowered some of our analyses. Larger sample sizes in future studies could address this limitation. Fourth, we found a great degree of heterogeneity in the MR analyses. However, we implemented several complementary methods to support the robustness of our findings and report only on results that held up across all methods. Other methods for genomic dissection such as Genomic SEM<sup><a href=""#CR81"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR81"">81</a></sup> could be used in future studies to strengthen the results presented here. Finally, the small effect sizes suggest that even if genetic variation may partially underpin the link between schizophrenia and LNL-ISO phenotypes, environmental variables are likely to play a substantial role in this association and should be explored in future epidemiological studies.</p>"
"<p id=""Par30"">In summary, our results shed additional light on the relationship between social isolation and schizophrenia from a genetic perspective, and lend further support for the potential role of LNL-ISO in the onset and maintenance of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders<sup><a href=""#CR82"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR82"">82</a></sup>. We also provide new insights into the influence of social isolation on comorbidity with other mental disorders and its interplay with behavioural traits. Given that social isolation and perceived loneliness may be modifiable, they could be targets for effective preventive interventions with a potentially substantial impact on mental health.</p>"
"<p id=""Par31"">We used a case-control sample including 1927 schizophrenia cases (65% males) and 1,561 healthy controls (HC) (55% males) from CIBERSAM (Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red en Salud Mental, Spain) as an independent target sample for polygenic score predictions (SCZ_CIBERSAM). All participants were genotyped as part of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC), and passed quality control (QC filters) per PGC-SZ2 criteria<sup><a href=""#CR83"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR83"">83</a></sup>. See <a href=""#MOESM1"" class=""usa-link"">Supplementary Methods</a> for a detailed description. Informed consent signed by each participating subject or legal guardian and approval from the corresponding Research Ethics Committee were obtained before starting the study.</p>"
"<p id=""Par32"">We used the following genetic summary statistics from the previous GWAS: (i) schizophrenia GWAS from the Psychiatric Genetic Consortium (PGC-SCZ2) comprising 35,476 cases and 46,839 controls<sup><a href=""#CR83"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR83"">83</a></sup>, (ii)LNL-ISO combined phenotype (LNL-ISO)<sup><a href=""#CR32"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR32"">32</a></sup> GWAS based on the combined multi-trait GWAS (MTAG) in the UKBB study, yielding an effective maximum sample size of 487,647 individuals, and (iii) the latest UKBB GWAS results for the independent loneliness and isolation traits that were included in the original LNL-ISO MTAG: (a) loneliness UKBB, (b) a proxy of social support, as measured by the frequency of family and friend visits and the number of people living in household, and (c) ability to confide in someone close to you. There is no overlap between PGC-SCZ2 and SCZ_CIBERSAM samples. Another recent schizophrenia GWAS<sup><a href=""#CR84"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR84"">84</a></sup>, including approximately 5000 new cases and 18,000 controls to PGC2, was also used to rule out changes in risk predictions or heritability estimates compared to PGC-SCZ2 GWAS (Supplementary Data <a href=""#MOESM5"" class=""usa-link"">2</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""Par33"">First, we selected variants that were included in both schizophrenia and LNL-ISO summary data. Second, we divided schizophrenia summary statistics from the set of overlapping variants (<em>N</em>_SNPs = 5,658,282) into two different subsets of variants, according to their effects in the LNL-ISO (Fig. <a href=""#Fig1"" class=""usa-link"">1</a>): those variants not associated with LNL-ISO (SCZ[noLNL]; <em>P</em><sub>LNL-ISO</sub> &gt; 0.05; <em>N</em>_SNPs = 5,172,017) and those variants associated with LNL-ISO (SCZ[LNL]; <em>P</em><sub>LNL-ISO</sub> &lt; 0.05; <em>N</em>_SNPs = 486,265). We selected this cutoff based on the fact that LNL-ISO-based PGS (PGS<sub>LNL-ISO</sub>) prediction on schizophrenia in the case-control target sample from CIBERSAM at <em>P</em><sub>LNL-ISO</sub> &gt; 0.05 was not significant (<em>R</em><sup>2</sup> (CI95%) = 0.052% (−0,09,0,19) at <em>P</em><sub>threshold</sub> &gt; 0.05, <em>P</em> = 0.569; Supplementary Data <a href=""#MOESM4"" class=""usa-link"">1C</a>). Third, based on the concordance or discordance of the effects of the same effect allele, we again divided SCZ[LNL] into those variants with concordant (SCZ[CONC]; <em>N</em>_SNPs = 269,361) or discordant (SCZ[DISC]; <em>N</em>_SNPs = 216,904) effects in schizophrenia and LNL-ISO (SCZ[CONC]: Beta<sub>SCZ</sub> &gt; 0 &amp; Beta<sub>LNL-ISO</sub> &gt; 0 OR Beta<sub>SCZ</sub> &lt; 0 &amp; Beta<sub>LNL-ISO</sub> &lt; 0; SCZ[DISC]: Beta<sub>SCZ</sub> &gt; 0 &amp; Beta<sub>LNL-ISO</sub> &lt; 0 OR Beta<sub>SCZ</sub> &lt; 0 &amp; Beta<sub>LNL-ISO</sub> &gt; 0). In each of the final datasets, we removed correlated SNPs due to linkage disequilibrium (LD) using PLINK 1.9 clumping algorithm (<em>r</em><sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.1; window size = 500 kb). See Supplementary Methods <a href=""#MOESM1"" class=""usa-link"">4</a> for further details.</p>"
"<p id=""Par34"">We performed polygenic models based on PGC-SZ2<sup><a href=""#CR83"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR83"">83</a></sup> (PGS<sub>SCZ</sub>) and LNL-ISO<sup><a href=""#CR32"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR32"">32</a></sup> (PGS<sub>LNL-ISO</sub>) GWAS summary statistics as the discovery samples, and SCZ_CIBERSAM case-control sample as the target sample (<em>N</em>_SCZ = 1927; <em>N</em>_HC = 1561). Several <em>P</em> thresholds were used (<em>P</em> &lt; 5 × 10<sup>−8</sup>, 5 × 10<sup>−5</sup>, 1 × 10<sup>−3</sup>, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5 and 1). Genetic variants within the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) were removed. We calculated standardized PGS and evaluated significance by logistic regression, using case-control status as dependent variable and sex, age, and ten first multidimensional scaling (MDS) ancestry components as covariates. Explained variance attributable to PGS was calculated as the increase in Nagelkerke’s pseudo-<em>R</em><sup>2</sup> between a model with and without the PGS variable. In PGS predictions with PGC-SZ2, Nagelkerke’s pseudo-<em>R</em><sup>2</sup> were converted to liability scale following the procedure proposed by Lee et al.<sup><a href=""#CR85"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR85"">85</a></sup> assuming a prevalence of schizophrenia in the general population ~1%<sup><a href=""#CR86"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR86"">86</a></sup>. We applied a correction for multiple testing to all <em>p</em>-values. CI for the increase in <em>R</em><sup>2</sup> was estimated through bootstrap resampling (<em>N</em> = 5000 permutations), applying the Normal Interval method, after checking the normality of the bootstrap distribution. In order to compare PGS<sub>LNL-ISO</sub> predictions with LNL-ISO’s constituent phenotypes (loneliness UKBB, frequency of family and friend visits, number of people living in household, and ability to confide), PGS contributions of these phenotypes to schizophrenia risk were also evaluated in the same target sample.</p>"
"<p id=""Par35"">Using the described separated subsets of variants based on their effect in LNL-ISO, we also calculated PGS<sub>SCZ</sub>. LD-independent variants within SCZ[noLNL] (<em>N</em>_clumped SNPs = 169,574), SCZ[LNL] (<em>N</em>_clumped SNPs = 11,804), SCZ[CONC] (<em>N</em>_clumped SNPs = 6468) and SCZ[DISC] (<em>N</em>_clumped SNPs = 5,336) were used to calculate PGS on the SCZ_CIBERSAM case-control sample. We calculated standardized PGS and evaluated significance with logistic regression models as described above.</p>"
"<p id=""Par36"">In order to assess the effect of sex on these models, we compared the explained variance in the case-control status for predisposing variation to schizophrenia within SCZ[noLNL], SCZ[LNL], SCZ[CONC] and SCZ[DISC] in females and males. Then, after bootstrap resampling (5000 permutations) of 500 schizophrenia and 500 HC subjects in each sex separately (see Supplementary Methods <a href=""#MOESM1"" class=""usa-link"">3</a>), we statistically compared the differences between the distribution of liability <em>R</em><sup>2</sup> in males and females across each genomic partition with two-sided <em>t</em>-tests. Since no sex differences have been reported in schizophrenia overall prevalence<sup><a href=""#CR87"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR87"">87</a>,<a href=""#CR88"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR88"">88</a></sup> we considered a prevalence estimate of 1% for both sexes. We also conducted a sensitivity analysis using recent prevalence estimates in the Spanish population<sup><a href=""#CR89"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR89"">89</a></sup> (prevalence in males = 0.0079 and females = 0.0045), with comparable findings (Supplementary Fig. <a href=""#MOESM1"" class=""usa-link"">4</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""Par37"">In order to understand the direction of the effect of the PGS across the different partitions (higher or lower values in SCZ patients compared to healthy controls), PGS<sub>SCZ</sub> comparisons across ranked deciles were also performed. The target sample was first separated into ten deciles of increasing PGS. The P-threshold with the lowest p-value was selected for each partition. The phenotype values of each decile were compared to those of the reference decile (the median (5th decile) was used as a reference) one by one, with decile status as a predictor of target phenotype (5th decile was coded 0 and tested decile 1) in a logistic regression model. OR values for each comparison were estimated from regression coefficients of these decile-status predictors. Sex, age, and ten first MDS ancestry components were used as covariates.</p>"
"<p id=""Par38"">The term “prediction” is used in relation to polygenic score models to conform to standard terminology in the field. However, these models are not used with a predictive purpose.</p>"
"<p id=""Par39"">We calculated SNP-based heritability (<em>h</em><sup><em>2</em></sup><sub><em>SNP</em></sub>) estimates for resulting genome partitions from dissections of schizophrenia summary genetic data based on LNL-ISO as described before: (i) SCZ[noLNL], SCZ[CONC], and SCZ[DISC] annotations; and (ii) sub-annotations from the intersection between those annotations (SCZ[noLNL] and SCZ[CONC]) and gene expression data from ten whole tissues<sup><a href=""#CR64"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR64"">64</a></sup>, 13 brain-related tissues (Brain GTEx<sup><a href=""#CR51"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR51"">51</a></sup>), and 3 brain cell-type annotation files (neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes<sup><a href=""#CR51"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR51"">51</a>,<a href=""#CR90"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR90"">90</a></sup>). The intersection with SCZ[DISC] was not included due to the low <em>h</em><sup><em>2</em></sup><sub><em>SNP</em></sub> for this annotation. ldsc v1.0.1<sup><a href=""#CR51"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR51"">51</a></sup>, a command-line tool for estimating heritability, was used. We performed both heritability enrichment analyses across the described annotations (<em>-h2</em>) and one-sided t-tests to evaluate whether the cell-type enrichment in schizophrenia within a particular LNL-ISO annotation was higher than the same cell-type enrichment in schizophrenia outside the LNL-ISO annotation (<em>-h2-cts</em>) (see Supplementary Methods <a href=""#MOESM1"" class=""usa-link"">5</a>). Additional information on the whole procedure is described in Supplementary Methods <a href=""#MOESM1"" class=""usa-link"">5</a>.</p>"
"<p id=""Par40"">To examine the influence of LNL-ISO based annotations (SCZ[noLNL], SCZ[CONC], and SCZ[DISC]) on the correlation between schizophrenia and other related disorders or traits, we calculated partial correlations using GNOVA<sup><a href=""#CR42"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR42"">42</a></sup> (<a href=""https://github.com/xtonyjiang/GNOVA"" class=""usa-link usa-link--external"" data-ga-action=""click_feat_suppl"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://github.com/xtonyjiang/GNOVA</a>). First, we selected neuropsychiatric and related phenotypes reportedly showing significant correlations with schizophrenia and/or loneliness/social isolation phenotypes in previous studies (i.e., major depression (MDD), attention and deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), anxiety disorder (ANX), bipolar disorder (BIP), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), alcohol dependence disorder (ALC-DEP), cross-disorder phenotype (CROSS-DIS)—based on a meta-analysis across eight mental disorders with a total sample of 232,964 cases and 494,162 controls— neuroticism (NEUR), depressive symptoms (DS), subjective well-being (SWB), psychotic experiences in the general population (PSY-EXP), and educational attainment (EA)). We also included body-mass index (BMI) summary data since some researchers report that this phenotype may be influenced by LNL-ISO<sup><a href=""#CR32"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR32"">32</a></sup> (see Supplementary Methods <a href=""#MOESM1"" class=""usa-link"">6</a> for references). We used covariance estimates based on partial correlations restricted to SNP subsets within each annotation conducted with GNOVA<sup><a href=""#CR42"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR42"">42</a></sup>. Derived <em>p</em>-values were statistically corrected using a Benjamini–Hochberg False Discovery Rate (FDR) procedure (<em>p</em><sub><em>FDR</em></sub> &lt; 0.05). See Supplementary Methods <a href=""#MOESM1"" class=""usa-link"">6</a> for further details.</p>"
"<p id=""Par41"">We used Mendelian Randomization (MR) to investigate the direction of the causal relationships between social isolation (LNL-ISO) and its constituents (i.e., loneliness UKBB, frequency of family visits, number of people in household, and ability to confide) with schizophrenia liability using the latest GWAS data available in MRC-IEU API resource<sup><a href=""#CR91"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR91"">91</a>,<a href=""#CR92"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR92"">92</a></sup> (<a href=""https://gwas.mrcieu.ac.uk"" class=""usa-link usa-link--external"" data-ga-action=""click_feat_suppl"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://gwas.mrcieu.ac.uk</a>; <a href=""https://mrcieu.github.io/ieugwasr/"" class=""usa-link usa-link--external"" data-ga-action=""click_feat_suppl"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://mrcieu.github.io/ieugwasr/</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""Par42"">We selected genome-wide significant SNPs at <em>p</em> &lt; 5 × 10<sup>−8</sup> except in the case of a number of people in household due to an insufficient number of instrumental variables (IV) at this threshold. We used a <em>p</em> &lt; 5 × 10<sup>−6</sup> instead. We applied a default LD-Clumping <em>r</em><sup>2</sup> threshold of 0.001 and a window of 10,000 kb. Five MR methods (i) Inverse variance-weighted method (IVW)<sup><a href=""#CR44"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR44"">44</a></sup>, (ii) WM<sup><a href=""#CR45"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR45"">45</a></sup>, (iii) MR-Egger<sup><a href=""#CR46"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR46"">46</a></sup>, (iv) SM, and (v) WMo<sup><a href=""#CR47"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR47"">47</a></sup> were performed using the R package TwoSampleMR v.0.5.3<sup><a href=""#CR92"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR92"">92</a></sup> (<a href=""https://github.com/mrcieu/TwoSampleMR"" class=""usa-link usa-link--external"" data-ga-action=""click_feat_suppl"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://github.com/mrcieu/TwoSampleMR</a>).

"<p id=""Par1"">Social disconnection, including objective social isolation and subjective loneliness, is linked to substantial health risks. Yet, little is known about the predictors of social disconnection in individuals with mental illness. Here, we used machine learning to identify predictors of social isolation and loneliness in schizophrenia (<em>N</em> = 72), a psychiatric condition associated with social disconnection. For comparison, we also included two other groups: a psychiatric comparison sample of bipolar disorder (<em>N</em> = 48) and a community sample enriched for social isolation (<em>N</em> = 151). We fitted statistical models of social isolation and loneliness within and across groups. Each model included five candidate predictors: social avoidance motivation, depression, nonsocial cognition, social anhedonia, and social cognition. The results showed that social anhedonia explained unique variance in social isolation and loneliness in all samples, suggesting that it contributes to social isolation and loneliness broadly. However, nonsocial cognition explained unique variance in social isolation only within schizophrenia. Thus, social anhedonia could be a potential intervention target across populations, whereas nonsocial cognition may play a unique role in determining social disconnection in schizophrenia.</p>"
"<p><strong>Subject terms:</strong> Human behaviour, Psychology</p>"
"<p id=""Par2"">The health risks associated with social disconnection, which includes social isolation (i.e., the <em>objective</em> lack of social ties) and loneliness (i.e., the <em>subjective</em> feeling of having fewer social ties than desired), are substantial. Social isolation and loneliness are generally moderately associated; however, experiencing either can contribute to immune system dysregulation and an increased risk of early mortality<sup><a href=""#CR1"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR1"">1</a>,<a href=""#CR2"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR2"">2</a></sup>. While the exact prevalence rate of social disconnection in schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders is unclear, studies suggest that it could be as high as 80% —more than double that of the general population<sup><a href=""#CR3"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR3"">3</a></sup>. Knowledge of specific variables that relate to social isolation and loneliness is critical to mitigate their potential health consequences. Yet, little is known about the variables that are linked to social isolation and loneliness in mental illness and specifically schizophrenia.</p>"
"<p id=""Par3"">To identify variables that are related to social isolation and loneliness in schizophrenia, it is critical to consider relevant variables from studies in serious mental illness (SMI) and the general population. Among individuals with SMI, research suggests links exist between isolation and nonsocial cognition, social cognition, and social anhedonia (i.e., lack of motivation for social engagement)<sup><a href=""#CR4"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR4"">4</a>–<a href=""#CR6"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR6"">6</a></sup>. In the general population, studies show that nonsocial cognition, social cognition, social avoidance (i.e., motivation to avoid negative social situations), depression, as well as isolation, predict loneliness<sup><a href=""#CR7"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR7"">7</a>–<a href=""#CR9"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR9"">9</a></sup>. Although relationships between those predictors and social isolation or loneliness have not been thoroughly examined in schizophrenia, social anhedonia could have particular relevance. Large-scale data-driven analyses in schizophrenia demonstrate that anhedonia is a central variable connecting multiple domains of social functioning<sup><a href=""#CR10"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR10"">10</a>–<a href=""#CR12"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR12"">12</a></sup>; however, the extent to which it explains unique variance in specific components of social functioning, such as social isolation and loneliness, is unclear.</p>"
"<p id=""Par4"">In the current study, we used a novel recruitment strategy to help identify predictors of social isolation and loneliness across groups. We recruited a schizophrenia sample, a psychiatric comparison sample of bipolar disorder (BD), and a community sample (CS) enriched for social isolation. BD is an appropriate psychiatric comparison sample because, like schizophrenia, it is episodic and can have cycles of relapse and remission. In addition, those with BD typically are not as impaired on various clinical features, such as social cognition and social motivation, compared to people with schizophrenia<sup><a href=""#CR13"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR13"">13</a></sup>, but still show greater impairment than healthy controls<sup><a href=""#CR14"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR14"">14</a></sup>. Part of the CS was recruited using standard methods, but some community participants responded to online advertisements seeking individuals who self-identified as socially isolated. With this recruitment strategy, we obtained distributions of social isolation in the CS comparable to those in the schizophrenia and BD samples. Having similar distributions of social isolation enabled us to look at predictors in which the results were not confounded by group level differences in social isolation, which is common in studies of schizophrenia.</p>"
"<p id=""Par5"">The wide range of variables that could impact social isolation and loneliness presents a challenge for interpretable data analysis. It is critical to account for interrelationships among variables and overall model complexity. Regression-based machine learning models utilizing a Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) account for such potential interrelationships among variables. Thus, with LASSO regression, we can test all possible combinations of variables and determine which combination results in the best-fitting model while avoiding overfitting<sup><a href=""#CR15"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR15"">15</a></sup>. Importantly, LASSO regression allows us to parsimoniously examine main effects and group interactions within the same model<sup><a href=""#CR16"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR16"">16</a></sup>.</p>"
"<p id=""Par6"">Therefore, we used LASSO regression to examine the degree to which social cognition, nonsocial cognition, depression, social anhedonia, and social avoidance motivation were linked to social isolation and loneliness in schizophrenia, a psychiatric comparison sample (BD), and a CS enriched for social isolation. We evaluated the relationships among these variables that were present within samples and how the relationships differed between samples.</p>"
"<p id=""Par7"">This study included 72 outpatients with schizophrenia, 48 with BD, and 151 community members. Participants were part of a larger study focused on the psychological components of social disconnection (RO1 <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MH110470"" class=""usa-link"" data-ga-action=""click_feat_suppl"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">MH110470</a> to MFG<sup><a href=""#CR17"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR17"">17</a></sup>). We recruited clinical samples from outpatient clinics at the Veterans Affairs Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System (GLA), the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), and outpatient facilities in the Greater Los Angeles area. We used the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (SCID-5<sup><a href=""#CR18"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR18"">18</a></sup>) for diagnoses. We corroborated diagnoses using medical records when available. All participants with schizophrenia and BD were clinically stable, with no hospitalizations within three months and no changes in psychoactive medication within four weeks. Both clinical samples were receiving psychoactive medications at the time of assessment.</p>"
"<p id=""Par8"">To recruit community members high in social isolation, we posted ads asking: “Do you have few friends, little contact with family members, and typically do activities alone?” From these ads, we recruited 96 participants. We also ran online ads like those used in our previous studies in which healthy controls were unselected for level of social connection and tended to be socially connected<sup><a href=""#CR19"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR19"">19</a></sup>. In that ad, we did not mention social isolation. Fifty-five participants responded to those ads. Thus, the CS contained both isolated and non-isolated individuals and overall was enriched for isolation.</p>"
"<p id=""Par9"">All participants in the CS provided psychiatric history through the SCID-5 and select sections of the SCID for Personality Disorders (SCID-PD<sup><a href=""#CR20"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR20"">20</a></sup>), which assessed for avoidant, paranoid, schizoid, schizotypal, and borderline characteristics. Participants were excluded if they met the criteria for a lifetime history of a psychotic disorder or bipolar disorder; however, personality disorder diagnoses were not exclusionary. Study procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Boards of GLA and UCLA, and all participants provided written informed consent.</p>"
"<p id=""Par10"">Inclusion criteria for all samples were age 20–60 and understanding of English. Study candidates were excluded if they had (a) any clinically significant neurological disease, (b) a history of serious head injury (loss of consciousness &gt; 1 h), (c) taken sedatives or benzodiazepines within 12 h of testing, (d) evidence of IQ &lt; 70 or developmental disability based on the Wide-Range Achievement Test 3rd ed. reading subtest<sup><a href=""#CR21"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR21"">21</a></sup>, (e) substance use disorder at moderate level or greater in the past three months, or (f) current mood episode meeting criteria for depression, hypomania, or mania. Race data were collected by free response to provide description of the study sample.</p>"
"<p id=""Par11"">Clinical symptom ratings were collected for all participants via semi-structured interviews. We used the Expanded Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS<sup><a href=""#CR22"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR22"">22</a></sup>) to assess positive symptoms, the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D<sup><a href=""#CR23"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR23"">23</a></sup>) to assess depressive symptoms, the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS<sup><a href=""#CR24"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR24"">24</a></sup>) to assess symptoms of mania, and the Clinical Assessment Interview for Negative Symptoms (CAINS<sup><a href=""#CR25"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR25"">25</a></sup>) to assess negative symptoms. We used the HAM-D total score as the measure of depression in all analyses.</p>"
"<p id=""Par12"">To examine social isolation, we used a composite calculated from a previous paper by our group<sup><a href=""#CR17"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR17"">17</a></sup>. The composite is from three complementary scales: (1) Lubben Social Network Scale (12 item version<sup><a href=""#CR26"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR26"">26</a></sup>), (2) Social Disconnectedness Scale (last 4 items<sup><a href=""#CR27"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR27"">27</a></sup>), and (3) the Role Functioning Scale (social and family scores<sup><a href=""#CR28"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR28"">28</a></sup>). First, we standardized the three scales based on the values from a non-isolated community subgroup to anchor the scores to a typical healthy control sample. Second, we took the average of the standardized values to create the composite score. Third, we inversed scores so that larger values indicated greater social isolation. Further information on the calculation of the composite, including its reliability, is in ref. <sup><a href=""#CR17"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR17"">17</a></sup>.</p>"
"<p id=""Par13"">We measured loneliness using the UCLA Loneliness Scale (ULS Version 3<sup><a href=""#CR29"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR29"">29</a></sup>). The ULS is a 20-item self-report measure that assesses trait loneliness. Items are rated on a 1 to 4 scale, with higher scores indicating greater loneliness. We used a total score ranging from 20 to 80. The ULS had good internal consistency in all samples (ω = 0.90 in schizophrenia; ω = 0.86 in BD; ω = 0.92 in the CS).</p>"
"<p id=""Par14"">We used a composite of three measures of social cognition: mentalizing<sup><a href=""#CR30"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR30"">30</a></sup>, empathic accuracy<sup><a href=""#CR31"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR31"">31</a></sup>, and facial affect identification<sup><a href=""#CR32"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR32"">32</a></sup>. Mentalizing was assessed using the awareness of social inference test (TASIT) – Part 3. For this task, participants watched a series of videotaped vignettes that depict social interactions and answered four types of questions about the social interactions, including what a person: (a) believes or knows, (b) means, (c) intends, and (d) feels<sup><a href=""#CR30"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR30"">30</a></sup>. Sixteen vignettes are included, each with an untrue comment presented as either sarcasm or as a lie. A higher score indicates better mentalizing, with scores ranging from 0 to 64.</p>"
"<p id=""Par15"">To measure empathic accuracy, we used a task from our prior studies<sup><a href=""#CR31"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR31"">31</a></sup>. Participants watched clips showing a person (a “target”) while they discussed a positive or negative autobiographical event. Participants used response keys to continuously rate how positive or negative they thought the target was feeling. The dependent measure was the mean correlation across clips between the participant’s ratings of the targets’ emotions and the targets’ ratings of their own emotions. A higher correlation indicated greater empathic accuracy.</p>"
"<p id=""Par16"">We measured facial affect identification by having participants report the emotion in still photographs from a standardized stimulus set<sup><a href=""#CR32"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR32"">32</a></sup>. The test included photos of 8 different people displaying facial expressions of 6 emotions (afraid, angry, disgusted, happy, sad, and surprised) and a neutral expression. The dependent variable was percent accuracy, with higher scores indicating greater facial affect identification.</p>"
"<p id=""Par17"">To create a composite measure of social cognition, we used principal component analysis. First, we standardized the variables using <em>z</em>-score transformation across the three samples. We then conducted a parallel analysis to determine the optimal number of components based on the covariance matrix structure. The parallel analysis indicated that the social cognitive variables optimally explained the proportion of variance in one component (variance explained = 0.556). The component loadings were high: TASIT = 0.818; empathic accuracy = 0.737; facial affect identification = 0.676. Higher scores indicated greater social cognitive ability.</p>"
"<p id=""Par18"">Nonsocial cognition was assessed using the neurocognitive composite of the Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB<sup><a href=""#CR33"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR33"">33</a></sup>). It measures 6 domains of cognitive functioning, including speed of processing, sustained attention, working memory, verbal learning and memory, visual learning and memory, and reasoning and problem solving. The composite was standardized to a T score based on national norms and corrected for age and gender.</p>"
"<p id=""Par19"">We used a brief version of the Social Anhedonia Scale (SAS<sup><a href=""#CR34"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR34"">34</a></sup>) to measure social anhedonia. This version of the scale includes 24 true-false questions and was chosen based on a factor analysis that showed improved fit compared to the original scale<sup><a href=""#CR35"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR35"">35</a></sup>. The items measure trait social approach motivation. True responses are scored as 1, and false responses as 0. We used a total score ranging from 0 to 17, with higher scores indicating greater social anhedonia. Internal consistency of the SAS was acceptable in all samples (ω = 0.82 for schizophrenia; ω = 0.78 for BD; ω = 0.85 for the CS).</p>"
"<p id=""Par20"">We used the Sensitivity to Rejection Scale<sup><a href=""#CR36"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR36"">36</a></sup> to measure social avoidance motivation. This scale includes 24 items assessing 5 factors of trait social avoidance. Items are scored using a 9-point scale ranging from −4 to +4. We used a total score ranging from −96 to +96, with higher scores indicating greater social avoidance. The scale had acceptable internal consistency in all samples (ω = 0.76 for schizophrenia; ω = 0.83 for BD; ω = 0.81 for the CS)</p>"
"<p id=""Par21"">We performed all analyses using R (Version 4.2.0), with code available at OSF (<a href=""https://osf.io/76ryh/"" class=""usa-link usa-link--external"" data-ga-action=""click_feat_suppl"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://osf.io/76ryh/</a>). Regularized regression models using LASSO were our primary analyses. LASSO regression is a machine learning technique in which all possible combinations of numerous variables can be automatically estimated to obtain the overall best-fitting and parsimonious model. A key feature of LASSO regression is that the estimated best-fitting model does not retain independent variables that have limited value in relation to the dependent variable<sup><a href=""#CR15"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR15"">15</a>,<a href=""#CR16"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR16"">16</a></sup>. This approach can be particularly beneficial when multiple group interactions are included in the model. LASSO regression uses cross-validation to test the robustness of model results across subsets (i.e., “folds”) of participants to reduce model overfitting<sup><a href=""#CR15"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR15"">15</a>,<a href=""#CR16"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR16"">16</a></sup>.</p>"
"<p id=""Par22"">All variables were standardized. First, we conducted within-group LASSO regression models (schizophrenia, BD, CS). For these models, we linked social isolation to loneliness, social cognition, nonsocial cognition, depression, social anhedonia, and social avoidance motivation across samples. In separate models, we linked loneliness from social isolation, social cognition, nonsocial cognition, depression, social anhedonia, and social avoidance motivation.</p>"
"<p id=""Par23"">Next, we wanted to know how comparable the predictors were across samples. To check this, we examined main effects across groups and group-based interaction effects for all independent variables. The schizophrenia sample was used as the reference group because it was the main clinical group of focus. Hence, the interactions show whether the associations between the independent variables in BD and the CS and social isolation and loneliness differ relative to schizophrenia.</p>"
"<p id=""Par24"">For the purposes of this study, all LASSO regression models were estimated using 5-fold cross-validation, in which the data were split into five equal parts, with the model built on 80% of the data and tested on the remaining 20%. We chose 5-fold cross-validation to balance model accuracy and complexity, consistent with prior research in schizophrenia<sup><a href=""#CR37"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR37"">37</a></sup>. The procedure involves testing a sequence of values that control the degree of regularization applied to the model coefficients (i.e., lambda values), thus preventing overfitting by penalizing (i.e., “shrinking”) large coefficients. The algorithm tests a sequence of 100 lambda values during the cross-validation process. These values determine the level of regularization applied to the model coefficients, starting from a maximum where all coefficients are zero to a minimum close to zero, enhancing the model’s fit to the data. The optimal lambda minimizes cross-validation error, providing a robust model. We conducted these analyses using the <em>glmnet</em> package<sup><a href=""#CR38"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR38"">38</a></sup>.</p>"
"<p id=""Par25"">Table <a href=""#Tab1"" class=""usa-link"">1</a> contains descriptive statistics of sociodemographic and symptom data, and all variables used in the machine learning analyses.

"<p id=""Par27"">In BD (Panel b), the model of social isolation had an R<sup>2</sup> of 0.48 and the model of loneliness had an R<sup>2</sup> of 0.45. In contrast to schizophrenia, multiple variables explained unique variance in social isolation, including social anhedonia (<em>β</em> = 0.03, % of runs = 81.96), depression (<em>β</em> = 0.16, % of runs = 96.72), social avoidance (<em>β</em> = 0.16, % of runs = 95.08), and loneliness (<em>β</em> = 0.17, % of runs = 100). However, nonsocial cognition shrunk to 0. For loneliness, all variables except nonsocial cognition were non-zero predictors, including social anhedonia (<em>β</em> = 0.10, % of runs = 83.05), depression (<em>β</em> = 0.28, % of runs = 96.61), social avoidance (<em>β</em> = 0.19, % of runs = 86.44), social cognition (<em>β</em> = 0.08, % of runs = 67.80), and social isolation (<em>β</em> = 0.38, % of runs = 100).</p>"
"<p id=""Par28"">In the CS (Panel c), the model of social isolation had an R<sup>2</sup> of 0.40 and the model of loneliness had an R<sup>2</sup> of 0.57. Like the schizophrenia and BD models, social anhedonia explained unique variance in both social isolation (<em>β</em> = 0.21, % of runs = 98.38) and loneliness (<em>β</em> = 0.31, % of runs = 100). Loneliness also explained unique variance in social isolation (<em>β</em> = 0.28% of runs = 100). In addition to social anhedonia, social cognition (<em>β</em> = 0.06, % of runs = 62.71), social avoidance (<em>β</em> = 0.18, % of runs = 88.13), depression (<em>β</em> = 0.25, % of runs = 93.22), and social isolation (<em>β</em> = 0.33, % of runs = 98.30) explained unique variance in loneliness. Nonsocial cognition was shrunk to 0.</p>"
"<p id=""Par29"">Next, we conducted the across-group analyses. For social isolation (Table <a href=""#Tab2"" class=""usa-link"">2</a>), social anhedonia, loneliness, and nonsocial cognition showed non-zero main effects. There were non-zero interactions between social isolation and loneliness, such that the effect between these variables was stronger in BD and CS, relative to schizophrenia. There was also an interaction between social isolation and nonsocial cognition, such that the effect was weaker in BD relative to schizophrenia. For illustrative purposes, we present simple correlations corresponding to these interactions in bivariate scatterplots (Fig. <a href=""#Fig2"" class=""usa-link"">2</a>).

<p>Variables in bold were retained in the final model.</p>
"<p id=""Par31"">As the R<sup>2</sup> values for social isolation and loneliness in the schizophrenia sample were substantially lower than the values observed in BD and CS, we conducted follow-up LASSO regression analyses including additional variables which could be relevant for explaining social isolation and loneliness, particularly within schizophrenia. In these models, we included the original set of variables, as well as positive symptoms from the BPRS, negative symptoms from the CAINS (expressive and motivational subscales), mania symptom from the YMRS, and demographic variables (age and gender). Adding these variables in schizophrenia increased the R<sup>2</sup> of social isolation to 0.39. The R<sup>2</sup> for loneliness increased to 0.26. The most notable finding was the large influence of motivational negative symptoms, which explained the greatest proportion of variance in social isolation in all three samples. However, this finding was not surprising, as there is a high degree of conceptual and measurement overlap between the social isolation and motivational negative symptoms measures. The full model results for all three samples are in the <a href=""#MOESM1"" class=""usa-link"">Supplemental Material</a>.</p>"
"<p id=""Par32"">We used machine learning to identify predictors of isolation and loneliness in samples of schizophrenia, BD, and community members enriched for social isolation. Three main findings emerged. First, social anhedonia explained unique variance in social isolation and loneliness across all samples. Second, social isolation and loneliness were linked to each other in the BD and CS but not in schizophrenia. Third, nonsocial cognition explained unique variance in social isolation specifically in schizophrenia. Overall, these results offer possible targets for transdiagnostic and schizophrenia-specific interventions.</p>"
"<p id=""Par33"">These results highlight the central and transdiagnostic role of social anhedonia. Greater social anhedonia was linked to social isolation and loneliness within and across schizophrenia, BD, and a community sample enriched for social isolation. While social anhedonia is linked to poor social functioning in schizophrenia<sup><a href=""#CR10"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR10"">10</a>–<a href=""#CR12"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR12"">12</a>,<a href=""#CR39"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR39"">39</a>,<a href=""#CR40"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR40"">40</a></sup>, this is the first study to our knowledge to show that it explains unique variance in social isolation and loneliness beyond social cognition, nonsocial cognition, depression, and social avoidance motivation. Similar patterns emerged in BD and CS, suggesting that these relationships are not unique to schizophrenia but exist across diagnoses.</p>"
"<p id=""Par34"">Social isolation and loneliness were significantly more strongly associated in BD and CS than in schizophrenia. The relatively low association between the two variables in schizophrenia is closer to what is seen in unselected population samples, in which the associations are around 0.25<sup><a href=""#CR27"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR27"">27</a>,<a href=""#CR41"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR41"">41</a></sup>. Hence, the associations in BD and CS were unusually high. There are a few possible reasons for this. Emotional reactions to social isolation may be more salient and cognitively accessible in patients with BD and possibly CS. These groups may be more aware of prior experiences involving social isolation and associated emotional reactions (e.g., loneliness) than those with schizophrenia<sup><a href=""#CR13"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR13"">13</a>,<a href=""#CR42"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR42"">42</a></sup>. In BD specifically, social avoidance played a role in both isolation and loneliness, something not observed in the other samples. Social avoidance in BD may be a byproduct of high sensitivity to social rejection, which could contribute to greater social isolation and loneliness<sup><a href=""#CR42"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR42"">42</a></sup>.</p>"
"<p id=""Par35"">Nonsocial cognition explained unique variance in social isolation in the schizophrenia sample but not in BD or CS. Deficits in nonsocial cognition are core components of schizophrenia and typically precede the onset of psychosis by several years<sup><a href=""#CR43"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR43"">43</a></sup>—a feature that is not reliably found with BD<sup><a href=""#CR44"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR44"">44</a>,<a href=""#CR45"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR45"">45</a></sup>. Hence, it is not surprising that nonsocial cognition was linked to social isolation in schizophrenia, but its lack of association with loneliness was notable. One study has reported a link between nonsocial cognition and loneliness, but it did not account for the other variables modeled in the current study<sup><a href=""#CR46"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR46"">46</a></sup>. Several variables were associated with loneliness in schizophrenia, suggesting that nonsocial cognition does not add explanatory power once accounting for other relevant variables, as it does for isolation. Another notable finding was the presence of an interaction between loneliness and depression in the CS, relative to schizophrenia. This result suggests that loneliness could be more strongly connected to disruptions in mood in non-clinical samples than in schizophrenia, where other clinical and contextual factors may influence the association. Lastly, in the follow-up analyses, we found that motivational negative symptoms from the CAINS had the strongest link to social isolation in all three samples. This finding is not surprising and may even be expected given that a main component of the motivational negative symptoms subscale centers around the feelings and overt behavior regarding social contact. In other words, having low motivation for social contact is associated with a higher degree of social isolation.</p>"
"<p id=""Par36"">Our main findings offer suggestions for both transdiagnostic and illness-specific interventions. Social anhedonia is a clear target for potential interventions aimed at improving social isolation and loneliness. It was the only variable to predict both forms of social disconnection across samples, suggesting that interventions for social anhedonia might help reduce social isolation and loneliness regardless of diagnosis. One existing relevant intervention is combined motivational interviewing and cognitive-behavioral therapy. This approach has recently been shown to improve motivational negative symptoms in schizophrenia and may have additional clinical utility in decreasing social isolation and loneliness<sup><a href=""#CR47"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR47"">47</a></sup>. Further, schizophrenia may benefit from a combined treatment focused on social anhedonia and nonsocial cognition. Lastly, social avoidance may have specific utility as a treatment target for social isolation in bipolar disorder. Virtual reality-based interventions focused on reducing loneliness and social anxiety could be a promising future direction<sup><a href=""#CR48"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR48"">48</a></sup>.</p>"
"<p id=""Par37"">The study had several limitations. A major limitation is that the data were cross-sectional and thus prevented us from drawing any causal conclusions about the results. Hence, even though we were able to show that specific variables explain significant variability in social isolation and loneliness, it remains to be seen whether they are the antecedents or consequences of social disconnection. Moreover, although the comparability of social isolation across groups is a strength of the study, the CS is not representative of the community at large due to the selection method. Specifically, the CS was only enriched for social isolation and not loneliness, making the extent to which these results translate to samples with high levels of loneliness unclear. Another limitation is that the social anhedonia and social avoidance measures were based on self-report. Observational or performance-based measures, such as social effort-based decision-making tasks<sup><a href=""#CR49"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR49"">49</a></sup>, could provide more sensitive indicators. Relatedly, we used a composite measure of the three social cognitive tasks instead of examining their unique effects. We chose to use a composite instead of individual tasks because of our modest sample sizes, along with the fact that some of the tasks (e.g., facial affect identification) are not designed for high reliability at the individual trial level. We also did not assess other domains that could potentially impact social isolation and loneliness, such as attribution biases. Additionally, the BD sample size was relatively small. Although LASSO can help overcome limitations of unequal sample sizes among the groups through regularization and cross-validation, the usual limitations of small samples still apply (e.g., generalization and power). Lastly, we accounted for less variance in social isolation and loneliness in schizophrenia compared to the amount accounted for in BD and CS. Thus, there is a need for larger machine learning studies that can include other potentially relevant variables that may help explain social disconnection in schizophrenia. One promising future direction in this area is to use social network analysis, which could help identify specific aspects of social networks (e.g., network interconnectedness) that contribute to social isolation and loneliness<sup><a href=""#CR50"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""CR50"">50</a></sup>.</p>"
"<p id=""Par38"">Social isolation and loneliness are associated with substantial public health risks. The present study used machine learning to identify social anhedonia as a transdiagnostic variable that is linked to social isolation and loneliness in schizophrenia, BD, and a CS enriched for social isolation. Pending replication in larger studies, social anhedonia may prove to be a particularly important target for the development or adaptation of interventions to address isolation and loneliness across multiple psychiatric groups and the broader community.</p>"

"<p id=""p0005"">In March 2020, the coronavirus emerged as a global pandemic. To decrease infection and death rate, hygiene and social distancing safety precautions were implemented. Accumulating evidence suggests that many individuals throughout the world are adhering to these recommended precautions (<a href=""#bb0025"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""bb0025"">Fong et al., 2020</a>). There was initially fear that greater adherence would lead to worsening mental health due to greater social isolation, loneliness, and fear of contamination; however, findings have been mixed in studies examining the general population and those with pre-existing mental health diagnoses (<a href=""#bb0005"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""bb0005"">Dean et al., 2021</a>; <a href=""#bb0040"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""bb0040"">Pinkham et al., 2020</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""p0010"">Although the COVID-19 pandemic has been found to worsen symptoms in the general population and those with psychotic disorders (<a href=""#bb0030"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""bb0030"">Lee et al., 2021</a>; <a href=""#bb0050"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""bb0050"">Wynn et al., 2021</a>; <a href=""#bb0010"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""bb0010"">Esposito et al., 2021</a>), the extent to which individuals with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders have followed recommended safety practices and whether such adherence has been associated with worsening mental health is unclear.</p>"
"<p id=""p0015"">The current study evaluated COVID-19 health, hygiene, and social distancing precaution adherence in two samples: 1) outpatients with schizophrenia (SZ: <em>n</em> = 32) and community controls (CN: <em>n</em> = 31); 2) individuals at clinical high-risk for psychosis (CHR: <em>n</em> = 25) and CN (<em>n</em> = 30). It was hypothesized that compared to CN, SZ and CHR participants would report experiencing greater fear of contracting the coronavirus and greater impact of health/social distancing on pursuit of recreational, goal-directed, and social activities; however, CN and clinical groups were expected to report being similarly adherent to recommended precautions.</p>"
"<p id=""p0020"">Participation occurred between July 9, 2020 and October 5, 2020. At the time of study completion, the COVID-19 pandemic state of emergency was still in effect and precautions were widely in place. Participants were originally recruited for studies that occurred prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Original recruitment occurred at outpatient mental health clinics and online or printed advertisements. Diagnosis was established via the SCID-5 (<a href=""#bb0015"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""bb0015"">First, 2014</a>). Participants in the CHR group included young adults recruited from the Georgia Psychiatric Risk Evaluation Program (G-PREP), which receives referrals from local clinicians to perform diagnostic assessment and monitoring evaluations for youth displaying psychotic experiences. CHR participants were included if they met criteria for a prodromal syndrome on the Structured Interview for Prodromal Syndromes (<a href=""#bb0035"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""bb0035"">Miller et al., 1999</a>). Healthy control participants (CN) were recruited through printed and online advertisements to match the SZ and CHR groups. CN completed a diagnostic interview, including the SCID-5 (<a href=""#bb0015"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""bb0015"">First, 2014</a>) and SCID-5-PD (<a href=""#bb0020"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""bb0020"">First et al., 2016</a>) and did not meet criteria for any current psychiatric disorder or schizophrenia-spectrum personality disorder. CN also had no family history of psychosis and did not meet lifetime criteria for psychotic disorders. No participants met criteria for substance use disorders (other than tobacco) and all denied lifetime history of neurological disorders associated with cognitive impairment. Clinical and CN groups did not significantly differ in age, parental education, sex, or ethnicity; however, CHR and SZ had lower personal education than their CN groups (see <a href=""#bb0045"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""bb0045"">Strauss et al., 2021</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""p0025"">Participants completed questionnaires assessing adherence to COVID-19 health precautions and psychiatric symptom changes during the pandemic. The questionnaire included six binary questions regarding the presence of COVID-19 fear and risk factors for infection. The final questions were conducted using a Likert Scale to indicate level of adherence with safety measures and/or withdraw from pre-pandemic recreational, goal-oriented, and social activity. Negative symptoms were assessed via the Negative Symptom Inventory Self Report (NSI-SR), which also included before and during pandemic reporting timeframes. Other scales designed to assess the frequency and distress resulting from hallucinations, delusions, depression, anxiety, and sleep problems before and during the pandemic were also administered. Results regarding symptom change are reported in <a href=""#bb0045"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""bb0045"">Strauss et al. (2021)</a> and forthcoming manuscripts.</p>"
"<p id=""p0030"">Chi-square analyses indicated that groups did not differ in the proportion of participants who reported being diagnosed with or having symptoms consistent with COVID-19, living with an essential worker, or practicing hygiene and social distancing precautions. CHR reported that fear of contracting COVID-19 kept them from enjoying recreational activities/hobbies, pursuing goals, and socializing more than CN (see <a href=""#t0005"" class=""usa-link"">Table 1</a>
). Correlations were conducted between physical/social distancing items and symptom change scores (during pandemic−pre-pandemic) for positive symptoms, negative symptoms, and general symptoms (depression, anxiety, sleep). Correlations indicated that greater adherence to COVID safety precautions was associated with greater increases in asociality (<em>r</em> = 0.29, <em>p</em> &lt; 0.01), but not other symptoms, during the pandemic.</p>"
<p>Group differences in COVID health and social distancing safety precautions.</p>
"<p id=""p0035"">Findings suggest that those with SZ-spectrum diagnoses are likely to follow recommended health/safety precautions, which are decreasing the frequency of social contact by their nature, but not leading to symptom exacerbations otherwise. These findings add to the growing literature suggesting that COVID-19 health and social distancing safety precautions are themselves not associated with increased mental health problems during the pandemic, even though mental health may indeed be worsening in individuals with and without pre-existing psychiatric conditions.</p>"

"<p id=""P1"">Schizophrenia is a major mental disorder that affects approximately 1% of the population worldwide. Cognitive deficits are a key feature of the disorder and a primary cause of long-term disability. Over the past decades, significant literature has accumulated demonstrating impairments in early auditory perceptual processes in schizophrenia. In this review, we first describe early auditory dysfunction in schizophrenia from both a behavioral and neurophysiological perspective and examine their interrelationship with both higher order cognitive constructs and social cognitive processes. Then, we provide insights into underlying pathological processes, especially in relationship to glutamatergic and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) dysfunction models. Finally, we discuss the utility of early auditory measures as both treatment targets for precision intervention and as translational biomarkers for etiological investigation. Altogether, this review points out the crucial role of early auditory deficits in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, in addition to major implications for early intervention and auditory-targeted approaches.</p>"

Although the outcome of schizophrenia is not uniformly negative, only a minority of individuals with first episode psychosis return to work or report being in a relationship (<a href=""#R5"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R5"">Ajnakina et al., 2021</a>; <a href=""#R43"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R43"">Cowman et al., 2021</a>). Life expectancy is reduced by 10–20 years of age (<a href=""#R28"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R28"">Chesney et al., 2014</a>). The direct and indirect annual costs of schizophrenia are estimated in the billions of dollars (<a href=""#R27"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R27"">Charrier et al., 2013</a>; <a href=""#R31"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R31"">Cloutier et al., 2016</a>). Although the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia focus primarily on positive symptoms, such as hallucinations or delusions, outcome in schizophrenia is strongly dependent upon impairments in cognitive processes that as yet are incompletely understood (rev. in <a href=""#R95"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R95"">Green et al., 2019</a>; <a href=""#R136"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R136"">Javitt, 2022</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P3"">In the National Institute of Mental Health Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) processes, the Cognitive Systems domain is defined to include constructs relating to perception as well as higher order processes such as attention, memory, language, cognitive control and working memory.

Over the past decades, significant literature has accumulated demonstrating impairments in auditory perceptual processes in schizophrenia and their interrelationship with both higher order cognitive constructs and social processes (<a href=""#R134"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R134"">Javitt, 2009</a>; <a href=""#R138"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R138"">Javitt and Freedman, 2015</a>). Moreover, auditory perceptual processes are highly amenable to translational, cross-species investigation, and thus can be used to gain insights into underlying pathological processes, especially in relationship to glutamatergic and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) hypofunction models (<a href=""#R138"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R138"">Javitt and Freedman, 2015</a>; <a href=""#R144"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R144"">Javitt et al., 1996</a>; <a href=""#R155"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R155"">Kantrowitz et al., 2016</a>).</p>"

"<p id=""P6"">In the HCP-MMP1.0 atlas, AA regions are divided into parcels A4, A5, STSdp, STSda, STSvp, STSva, STGa, and TA2. AA, in turn, projects to distributed “higher-order” brain regions in the temporal, parietal and frontal cortices through parallel “what” and “where” pathways (<a href=""#R229"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R229"">Poeppel et al., 2012</a>). Projections to pars triangularis regions of the left and right inferior frontal gyri (IFG), corresponding to Broca’s area and Broca’s right homolog (BA45), respectively, may be of particular importance as these regions mediate auditory inputs into language (left) and prosodic (right) generation regions (<a href=""#R11"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R11"">Belyk and Brown, 2014</a>; <a href=""#R179"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R179"">Kujala and Leminen, 2017</a>)</p>"

Deficits in auditory processing in schizophrenia may be mapped against these underlying substrates.</p>"
"<p id=""P8"">As originally conceptualized by Kraepelin, deficits in cognitive function represent a core feature of schizophrenia and contribute significantly to impairments in functional outcome (<a href=""#R52"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R52"">Donde et al., 2019a</a>; <a href=""#R173"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R173"">Kraepelin, 1907</a>). Cognitive processes may be subdivided into two broad categories: those involved primarily with social interaction (“social cognition”) and those more broadly involved in higher order cognitive operations such as attention, working memory, reasoning and problem solving, or visual/verbal learning (“neurocognition”). Deficits in both social- and neurocognition have been extensively documented in schizophrenia (<a href=""#R94"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R94"">Green, 1996</a>; <a href=""#R96"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R96"">Green et al., 2000</a>; <a href=""#R136"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R136"">Javitt, 2022</a>) and are evaluated using well-established cognitive batteries, such as the MATRICS consensus cognitive battery (MCCB) (<a href=""#R166"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R166"">Kern et al., 2008</a>; <a href=""#R217"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R217"">Nuechterlein et al., 2008</a>). In contrast, sensory processes have been less studied and there are currently no standardized assessment batteries for use in clinical characterization. Nevertheless, there is increasing evidence to document both impairments in early auditory processing and contributions of auditory processing deficits to deficits in both social and neurocognition.</p>"
"<p id=""P9"">Study of the auditory function in schizophrenia is influenced heavily by the concept of the <em>auditory “echoic” memory system</em>, that was elaborated most completely by Cowan in the early 1980’s (<a href=""#R41"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R41"">Cowan, 1984</a>). An initial model of human cognitive organization viewed sensory regions as largely passive structures that conveyed sensory information to higher cognitive regions (<a href=""#R21"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R21"">Broadbent, 1958</a>). This was updated by <a href=""#R8"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R8"">Baddeley in the 1970’s</a>, who emphasized the existence of additional, “slave” systems, such as the phonological loop, that maintained sensory-specific short-term memories (<a href=""#R8"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R8"">Baddeley, 1970</a>). In the 1980–90s, Cowan and others identified a specific short-term memory system, termed the auditory sensory or “echoic” memory system, that stored relatively unprocessed sensory information for durations of <sup>~</sup>20–30 seconds outside the “attentional spotlight” (<a href=""#R42"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R42"">Cowan, 1993</a>; <a href=""#R134"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R134"">Javitt, 2009</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P10"">In retrospect, the first published test of echoic memory in schizophrenia was performed in the mid 1960’s even prior to description of the system. In their study, Billingberg &amp; Jonsson sought to investigate mechanisms underlying paranoia by presenting schizophrenia patients with friendly or neutral words recited with friendly, neutral or threatening intonation (the “Intonation test”) (<a href=""#R15"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R15"">Billingberg and Jonsson, 1965</a>). As a control, an additional auditory test was included in which participants had to identify a short “sound effect” (e.g., a train, a dentist drill).</p>"
"<p id=""P11"">As predicted, patients demonstrated paranoid misattribution (i.e., “neutral” and “friendly” stimuli considered as “threatening”) in comparison to controls. However, schizophrenia patients were also impaired in the “sound effect” auditory test, suggesting the possibility of a more basic underlying auditory deficit. Consequently, a second study was conducted with an even simpler sensory control task in which individuals were asked to match tones following brief delay. In this study, no misattribution of threat was observed. Nevertheless, patients were significantly impaired in the ability to match tones (<a href=""#R52"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R52"">Donde et al., 2019a</a>; <a href=""#R153"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R153"">Jonsson and Sjostedt, 1973</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P12"">The first focused tests of early auditory processing (EAP) were performed in the mid-1990’s, based on “echoic memory” concepts (<a href=""#R121"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R121"">Holcomb et al., 1995</a>; <a href=""#R262"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R262"">Strous et al., 1995</a>). These studies used a simple tone-matching test (TMT) in which two tones were presented with brief intervening delay (rev. in (<a href=""#R55"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R55"">Donde et al., 2017</a>; <a href=""#R146"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R146"">Javitt and Sweet, 2015</a>)). Subsequent studies demonstrated that the elevations in tone-matching thresholds reflected failures in encoding of the initial sensory information, while subsequent retention of information within the echoic memory trace was intact (<a href=""#R145"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R145"">Javitt et al., 1997</a>). Furthermore, schizophrenia participants were no more affected than controls by same (<a href=""#R232"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R232"">Rabinowicz et al., 2000</a>) or cross-modality (<a href=""#R145"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R145"">Javitt et al., 1997</a>) distractors, again emphasizing the “bottom-up” nature of the deficit and encouraging further investigation of the underlying processes. A recent meta-analysis of eighteen separate studies showed a statistically large deficit in schizophrenia (SMD=1.17, p&lt;0.001) (<a href=""#R55"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R55"">Donde et al., 2017</a>). Significant heterogeneity of the deficit was also observed (p=0.04) suggesting likely cohort effects (<a href=""#R55"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R55"">Donde et al., 2017</a>). In long-term follow-up studies, tone-matching scores have been found to be extremely stable over time, suggesting that they reflect a trait, rather than state, psychophysiological measure (<a href=""#R56"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R56"">Donde et al., 2019b</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P13"">In support of the heterogeneity finding, further statistical analysis of tone-matching data demonstrated a bimodal deficit pattern (<a href=""#R56"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R56"">Donde et al., 2019b</a>), which permitted groups to be separated into those with impaired (EAP−) vs. intact (EAP+) EAP function (<a href=""#F1"" class=""usa-link"">Fig. 1C</a>). EAP− individuals were more likely drawn from chronic inpatient or residential care facilities, whereas EAP+ individuals were more likely drawn from outpatient facilities and to be living independently (<a href=""#R56"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R56"">Donde et al., 2019b</a>; <a href=""#R186"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R186"">Lee et al., 2018b</a>; <a href=""#R232"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R232"">Rabinowicz et al., 2000</a>). EAP− and EAP+ individuals showed similar levels of positive and negative symptoms, although cognitive symptoms were significantly higher in EAP− vs. EAP+ individuals. EAP− vs. EAP+ individuals also had lower estimated premorbid IQ (96.2±11.5 vs. 106.3±8.5, d=.67) although both remained close to the population mean. EAP− individuals also achieved fewer grades of education (13.2±7.2 vs. 16.7±8.9) and were significantly less likely to have pursued education beyond high school (25.5% vs. 50.9%), even though parental socioeconomic status was similar to EAP+.</p>"
"<p id=""P14"">In neuropsychological testing using the MATRICS battery (<a href=""#R166"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R166"">Kern et al., 2008</a>; <a href=""#R217"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R217"">Nuechterlein et al., 2008</a>), EAP− individuals showed an additional deficit of <sup>~</sup>1 sd across measures, although with somewhat preserved function in visual learning and reasoning/problem solving. Mean antipsychotic dose was significantly higher for EAP− vs. EAP+ individuals (d=.35, &lt;.005) but did not co-vary with tone-matching test performance. Nevertheless, these results support EAP deficits as a potential marker of treatment-resistance, which may encourage early use of clozapine.</p>"
"<p id=""P15"">Deficits in tone matching performance correlate highly with measures of auditory social cognition including auditory emotion recognition (AER) and sarcasm (“attitudinal prosody”) detection, and with measures of auditory verbal learning across participants (<a href=""#R56"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R56"">Donde et al., 2019b</a>). In principal components analysis, tone matching, social cognition measures and MCCB domain scores separated along 2 axes which can be conceptualized as auditory vs. visual (PC1) and social vs. neurocognition (PC2) (<a href=""#F1"" class=""usa-link"">Fig. 1B</a>). TMT performance segregated most strongly with the auditory social cognition measures, but with limited distance to neurocognitive measures such as verbal learning, emphasizing the importance of EAP deficits to both social and neurocognitive dysfunction.</p>"
"<p id=""P16"">Although the majority of tone-matching studies have investigated pitch discrimination, similar deficits are observed for detection of intensity (<a href=""#R53"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R53"">Donde et al., 2020a</a>; <a href=""#R121"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R121"">Holcomb et al., 1995</a>; <a href=""#R153"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R153"">Jonsson and Sjostedt, 1973</a>), duration (<a href=""#R53"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R53"">Donde et al., 2020a</a>; <a href=""#R153"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R153"">Jonsson and Sjostedt, 1973</a>), or location (<a href=""#R201"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R201"">Matthews et al., 2013</a>; <a href=""#R219"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R219"">Olsson and Nielzen, 1999</a>; <a href=""#R227"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R227"">Perrin et al., 2010</a>; <a href=""#R228"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R228"">Perrin et al., 2018</a>). In one study that utilized the Montreal Battery for Assessment of Amusia (<a href=""#R160"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R160"">Kantrowitz et al., 2014b</a>), 45% of participants with schizophrenia were classified as “amusical” vs. 9% of healthy comparison individuals. Large-size statistical effects (d=1.3) were seen across “melody,” “rhythm” and “memory” domains, and remained significant even following statistical control for overall cognitive impairments. A recent study using the Test of Basic Auditory Abilities (TBAC) along with other pitch discrimination tasks found significant, moderate effect sizes (d=.51-.66) across intensity, frequency and duration (<a href=""#R174"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R174"">Kraus et al., 2019</a>), also supporting prior research.</p>"
"<p id=""P17"">Critical substrates for auditory echoic memory assessed by tone-matching paradigms are localized to the auditory cortex in the region of the STP in non-human primates (<a href=""#R35"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R35"">Colombo et al., 1990</a>; <a href=""#R131"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R131"">Iversen, 1973</a>), and are unaffected even by large structural lesions in the prefrontal areas (<a href=""#R131"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R131"">Iversen, 1973</a>; <a href=""#R294"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R294"">Zatorre and Samson, 1991</a>). In humans, detection of pitch change between individual tones (i.e., simple tone-matching) appears to be specifically associated to the A1 activity, as shown by elevated threshold in case reports of ischemia and edema involving the medial part of the HG and sparing the associative components of the auditory cortex (<a href=""#R102"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R102"">Habib et al., 1995</a>; <a href=""#R114"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R114"">Hattiangadi et al., 2005</a>). Congruent with this association, tone-matching abilities remained similar to controls in patients with temporal lobe excisions that encroached the STG while sparing the HG (<a href=""#R149"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R149"">Johnsrude et al., 2000</a>). Fine-grained analysis of loudness may also depend upon A1, although coarse discrimination is possible even following A1 lesion (<a href=""#R63"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R63"">Dykstra et al., 2012</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P18"">Furthermore, neuroimaging studies showed that the ability to detect pitch-change is related to isolated A1 activations (<a href=""#R100"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R100"">Griffiths, 2003</a>). In parallel, a slightly more complex component of active frequency analysis of non-verbal tones was identified: the detection of pitch change in pitch patterns such as melodies (i.e., identifying if 3 tones have “same” or “different” pitch and, if “different”, which one differed from the others) (<a href=""#R99"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R99"">Griffiths, 2001</a>, <a href=""#R100"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R100"">2003</a>). By contrast to simple tone-matching (i.e., identifying if 2 tones have “same” or “different” pitch), detection of change in pitch patterns is instead associated with AA regions, as shown by additional activations in associative areas located within the STG (<a href=""#R224"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R224"">Patterson, 1990</a>), STP (<a href=""#R101"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R101"">Griffiths et al., 1998</a>; <a href=""#R261"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R261"">Stewart et al., 2008</a>) or both (<a href=""#R285"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R285"">Warren and Griffiths, 2003</a>) when healthy participants are exposed to pitch change in a ≥ 3-tones melody.</p>"
"<p id=""P19"">In schizophrenia, tone-matching deficits have also been evaluated relative to resting-state functional connectivity between structures within the early auditory system, including MGN, EA and AA auditory regions. EAP− individuals showed significant functional connectivity impairments among these structures (<a href=""#F1"" class=""usa-link"">Fig. 1D</a>). When analyses were performed relative to pre-defined cortical parcels, between-group differences were prominent both between MGN and A1, and between MGN and parcels A4, A5 and STGa (<a href=""#F1"" class=""usa-link"">Fig. 1E</a>) that are known to be activated during auditory language tasks (<a href=""#R90"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R90"">Glasser et al., 2016</a>). Correlations with tone-matching impairments in patients intercorrelated most strongly with functional connectivity between MGN and STGa, an area that is also activated by tasks involving theory-of-mind (<a href=""#F1"" class=""usa-link"">Fig. 1F</a>). Overall, these findings support concepts that tone-matching deficits reflect dysfunction within primary auditory cortex and surrounding regions and encourage further targeted investigation of these regions.</p>"
"<p id=""P20"">EAP deficits similar to those observed in schizophrenia are also reported in developmental dyslexia and are related to the ability to manipulate speech sounds (“phonological processing”). Initial evidence of impaired phonological processing in schizophrenia came from studies of the ability of schizophrenia individuals to distinguish isolated phonemes, such as /da/ or /ba/, that differ only in pitch direction change at stimulus onset (<a href=""#R178"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R178"">Kugler and Caudrey, 1983</a>). Although the underlying tonal frequencies of individual phonemes may vary considerably both across speakers and across position of the phoneme in a word, there is normally a sharp categorical boundary between phonemes such that these within-phoneme variations are ignored. In schizophrenia, a shallower boundary is observed, consistent with a reduced precision in processing the underlying tonal frequencies (<a href=""#R29"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R29"">Cienfuegos et al., 1999</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P21"">Subsequent studies evaluated phonological processing using tasks such as the Comprehensive Test of Phonological Processing (CTOPP) (<a href=""#R283"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R283"">Wagner et al., 1999</a>), and showed significant impairment in the ability to manipulate phonemes as indexed by measures such as phonological awareness or memory (<a href=""#R234"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R234"">Revheim et al., 2006</a>; <a href=""#R235"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R235"">Revheim et al., 2014</a>). In these studies, deficits in phonological processing correlated significantly with deficits in more basic tone-matching ability and, in turn, predicted impairments in reading fluency and overall functional outcome. In addition, the correlations between phonological processing deficits and functional outcome remained significant even following covariation for other neurocognitive deficits (e.g., working memory). As with tone-matching, phonological processing impairments correlated with resting-state functional connectivity indices within the early auditory system (<a href=""#R56"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R56"">Donde et al., 2019b</a>). At present, as with tone-matching, phonological processing and reading fluency measures are not incorporated into standard batteries for the assessment of schizophrenia (e.g., MCCB), but might become valuable additions.</p>"
"<p id=""P22"">Neurophysiological mechanisms underlying EAP deficits can be efficiently investigated using EEG and event-related potential (ERP) measures, which may be used to trace the flow of information within the early auditory system with high temporal resolution, and fMRI, which may be used to localize ERP generator regions. One ERP measure that has proven particularly useful is mismatch negativity (MMN). MMN indexes processes relevant to the echoic memory system and can be used translationally across species and computationally to investigate underlying mechanisms. MMN has also proven useful in testing neurodevelopmental vs. neurodegenerative mechanisms and in identifying individuals for early intervention. Paradigms for assessment of auditory plasticity have been developed for the study of developmental dyslexia and have also proven sensitive to neurophysiological impairments in schizophrenia. Additional measures including the auditory 40 Hz steady-state response (ASSR) and P1/N1 potentials provide additional insights into mechanisms of early auditory dysfunction in schizophrenia.</p>"
"<p id=""P23"">MMN is elicited most commonly in the context of an auditory oddball paradigm in which a sequence of repetitive auditory stimuli is interrupted infrequently by a physically or conceptually different deviant (“oddball”) stimulus (<a href=""#F2"" class=""usa-link"">Fig. 2A</a>). In this paradigm, MMN is defined as the difference in response amplitude to deviant minus standard stimuli (<a href=""#F2"" class=""usa-link"">Fig. 2B</a>). Using fMRI, generators for MMN have been localized primarily to Heschl’s gyrus and surrounding regions of the STG and planum temporale (<a href=""#R209"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R209"">Molholm et al., 2006</a>; <a href=""#R221"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R221"">Opitz et al., 2002</a>; <a href=""#R247"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R247"">Schonwiesner et al., 2007</a>; <a href=""#R286"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R286"">Wible et al., 2001</a>).

"<p id=""P98"">Neurophysiological approaches to early auditory assessment. <strong>A.</strong> The typical oddball sequence (A, left) utilizes two stimuli that differ in stimulus quality.

"<p id=""P25"">MMN assessments have also been used to understand the nature of phonemic processing abnormalities in schizophrenia. As with other MMN types, MMN to alterations in the phonetic properties of phonemes have been repeatedly documented in patients, and shown to correlate with illness duration, likelihood to relapse and functional outcome (e.g. (<a href=""#R74"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R74"">Fisher et al., 2008</a>; <a href=""#R75"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R75"">Fisher et al., 2019</a>; <a href=""#R163"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R163"">Kawakubo et al., 2007</a>; <a href=""#R164"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R164"">Kawakubo et al., 2011</a>; <a href=""#R208"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R208"">Mi et al., 2021</a>)).</p>"
"<p id=""P26"">Neurodevelopmental studies in children indicate that tone-matching ability becomes adultlike in children aged 6 to 7 years, while the sensitivity to change in pitch-patterns (i.e. ≥ 3-tones melodies) significantly improves later, from 8 to 9 years of age, suggesting that EA inputs to the surrounding AA structures allowing pitch-pattern detection are crucial over the course of brain development (<a href=""#R36"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R36"">Cooper, 1994</a>; <a href=""#R68"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R68"">Fancourt, 2013</a>; <a href=""#R274"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R274"">Trehub et al., 1986</a>). Sequential acquisition of tone-matching and pitch-patterns discrimination ability throughout the neurodevelopmental course indicates that early alterations (<a href=""#R233"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R233"">Rapoport et al., 2012</a>) or neurodegenerative processes during later adolescence described in schizophrenia could account for present findings (<a href=""#R129"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R129"">Insel, 2010</a>). However, studies performed to date have not observed deficits in tone-matching ability in individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) for schizophrenia, suggesting that early auditory processes are relatively intact before the onset of the disorder, or that individuals with premorbid EAP deficits are not being captured by existing CHR criteria and current recruitment approaches (<a href=""#R38"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R38"">Corcoran et al., 2015</a>; <a href=""#R56"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R56"">Donde et al., 2019b</a>; <a href=""#R175"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R175"">Kraus et al., 2022</a>). In contrast to the behavioral measures, related neurophysiological indices, such as MMN continue to develop into adulthood (<a href=""#R16"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R16"">Bishop et al., 2011</a>), and thus may index continued neurodevelopment during ages associated with schizophrenia onset (<a href=""#R39"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R39"">Corcoran et al., 2018b</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P27"">Consistent with this development time course, MMN may be especially useful in predicting conversion and remission in CHR individuals. MMN deficits in individuals with prodromal symptoms of schizophrenia were first reported over 15 years ago (<a href=""#R17"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R17"">Bodatsch et al., 2011</a>; <a href=""#R22"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R22"">Brockhaus-Dumke et al., 2005</a>) and have been replicated extensively since with greatest predictive value provided by a combined pitch and duration (“double”) deviant (rev. in <a href=""#R108"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R108"">Hamilton et al., 2022</a>; <a href=""#R268"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R268"">Tada et al., 2019</a>). Significant deficits are seen between CHR individuals as a group with an effect size of <sup>~</sup>.4 sd depending upon stimulus type (<a href=""#F2"" class=""usa-link"">Fig. 2B</a>), and between CHR individuals that convert to schizophrenia vs. those who do not (<a href=""#R226"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R226"">Perez et al., 2014</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P28"">MMN may also assist in prediction of individuals who will remit from the CHR vs. those who remain symptomatic (<a href=""#R109"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R109"">Hamilton et al., 2021</a>). As in individuals with established schizophrenia, MMN also predicts functional disability in CHR individuals (<a href=""#R106"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R106"">Hamilton et al., 2018b</a>; <a href=""#R268"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R268"">Tada et al., 2019</a>). Nevertheless, results have been somewhat variable across studies and may be affected by factors such as medication status (<a href=""#R108"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R108"">Hamilton et al., 2022</a>). Large-scale studies are presently ongoing and may provide definitive evidence for utility of MMN within the clinical management of early-stage schizophrenia.</p>"
"<p id=""P29"">In contrast to the meta-analytic deficits reported in CHR, a recent meta-analysis of first-episode schizophrenia reported relatively intact activity at illness onset (<a href=""#R103"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R103"">Haigh et al., 2017a</a>), followed by degeneration over the initial course of the illness associated with volume reductions in auditory sensory cortex (<a href=""#R44"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R44"">Curtis et al., 2021</a>; <a href=""#R103"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R103"">Haigh et al., 2017a</a>; <a href=""#R104"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R104"">Haigh et al., 2017b</a>; <a href=""#R203"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R203"">McCarley et al., 2002</a>; <a href=""#R214"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R214"">Murphy et al., 2020</a>; <a href=""#R245"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R245"">Salisbury et al., 2020b</a>; <a href=""#R278"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R278"">Umbricht et al., 2006</a>). At present, the differential findings in CHR and first-episode schizophrenia are somewhat different to reconcile, but may suggest multiple trajectories to schizophrenia, including potentially an acute neurodegenerative pattern that is poorly represented within CHR programs. For instance, it is possible that the present CHR recruitment methods and criteria might not adequately account for individuals with premorbid EAP deficiencies and more severe cognitive deficits.</p>"
"<p id=""P30"">To the extent that auditory function does degenerate over early stages of the illness, it is possible that it could be rescued by appropriate behavioral, pharmacological or non-invasive-brain stimulation-based interventions. MMN has been extensively characterized in both non-human primate (<a href=""#R182"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R182"">Lakatos et al., 2020</a>) and rodent (<a href=""#R69"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R69"">Featherstone et al., 2018</a>) models, permitting its use both translationally and in early stage drug development (see <a href=""#S22"" class=""usa-link"">Section 4</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P31"">The MMN paradigm is predicated on the concept thatbrain responses to auditory stimuli differ when they are presented in isolation vs. when they are presented intermixed with more frequent intervening standards. Because MMN is expressed as the difference between responses to deviant and standard stimuli during repeated presentation, an early controversy regarding MMN generation focused on the degree to which it reflects a relative reduction in responses to standard stimuli during the course of stimulation – a process termed “stimulus specific adaptation” (SSA) vs. a short-term memory-based increase in response to the deviant stimulus (<a href=""#R216"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R216"">Naatanen et al., 1978</a>; <a href=""#R287"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R287"">Winkler and Czigler, 1998</a>) - a process that has increasingly come to be termed “prediction error” (PE) (<a href=""#R81"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R81"">Friston, 2005</a>; <a href=""#R116"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R116"">Heilbron and Chait, 2018</a>; <a href=""#R282"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R282"">Wacongne, 2016</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P32"">SSA concepts are based on the observation that auditory ERP to repetitive standard stimuli decrease with increasing stimulation rate, so that stimuli that are presented less often in the oddball sequence (deviants) will elicit larger responses than those presented more frequently (standards) based on refractoriness alone (<a href=""#R112"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R112"">Harpaz et al., 2021</a>; <a href=""#R202"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R202"">May, 2021</a>). Nevertheless, early studies argued against this explanation first, by demonstrating that the first stimulus in a sequence does not elicit MMN; second, by showing topography differences between MMN and N1 responses to standard stimuli; and finally, by using paradigmatic control conditions (e.g. multiple standards), which produce equivalent refractoriness but nevertheless prevent MMN generation (<a href=""#R116"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R116"">Heilbron and Chait, 2018</a>; <a href=""#R216"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R216"">Naatanen et al., 1978</a>; <a href=""#R287"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R287"">Winkler and Czigler, 1998</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P33"">Mnemonic template models of MMN are based on the concept that excitatory neurons in the brain are under some level of ongoing tonic inhibition and that repetitive standards create a disinhibitory mnemonic template in neurons sensitive to stimulus features dissimilar to those of the standard. When a stimulus differs from the preceding standards, it elicits greater activity than if the same stimulus had been presented in isolation. In this framework, prediction errors are generated within the same neurons that encode the bottom-up predictions (<a href=""#R144"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R144"">Javitt et al., 1996</a>; <a href=""#R182"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R182"">Lakatos et al., 2020</a>; <a href=""#R216"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R216"">Naatanen et al., 1978</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P34"">More recent predictive coding (PC) models have proposed instead that predictions are generated primarily top-down, although they converge with mnemonic template models in proposing that the prediction error (PE) signal is generated within lower-level cortical regions (<a href=""#R81"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R81"">Friston, 2005</a>). Although the assumption of separate prediction PE neurons, and of top-down generation of predictions remains controversial (<a href=""#R50"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R50"">Denham and Winkler, 2020</a>; <a href=""#R116"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R116"">Heilbron and Chait, 2018</a>), nevertheless it serves as a heuristic model for ongoing research.</p>"
"<p id=""P35"">PC-based models of MMN have been tested using dynamic causal modelling (DCM) to evaluate the relative contribution of feedforward and feedback connections in the auditory system. In DCM studies in normative individual, MMN was best modelled by assuming local interactions with A1, as well as reciprocal interactions between A1, STG and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) in the region of Broca’s right homolog (<a href=""#R86"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R86"">Garrido et al., 2008</a>; <a href=""#R87"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R87"">Garrido et al., 2009</a>) (<a href=""#F2"" class=""usa-link"">Fig. 2D</a>). Notably, however, the leading phase (e.g. 50–150 ms) of MMN in response to frequency deviants reflected primarily intrinsic alterations within auditory cortex, whereas extrinsic changes between cortical levels were manifest primarily at longer latencies (i.e. &gt;150 ms) (<a href=""#R87"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R87"">Garrido et al., 2009</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P36"">In schizophrenia, between-group deficits are prominent at the earliest phase of MMN generation and remain consistent over time (e.g. <a href=""#F2"" class=""usa-link"">Fig. 2B</a>), consistent with the concept that they reflect abnormalities primarily in intrinsic changes within auditory cortex (<a href=""#R87"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R87"">Garrido et al., 2009</a>). These findings are consistent as well with fMRI studies showing significant reductions in deviance-related activity not only in A1 (<a href=""#R85"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R85"">Gaebler et al., 2020</a>) but also within subcortical relay regions such as inferior colliculus and thalamic MGN (<a href=""#R85"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R85"">Gaebler et al., 2020</a>) that propagate in a feed-forward approach to produce impaired activations in schizophrenia.</p>"
"<p id=""P37"">Although the majority of MMN studies in schizophrenia use a simple oddball paradigm, some studies have used omission (“missing stimulus”) (<a href=""#R176"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R176"">Kreitschmann-Andermahr et al., 1999</a>; <a href=""#R241"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R241"">Rudolph et al., 2015</a>; <a href=""#R244"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R244"">Salisbury and McCathern, 2016</a>), gestalt (<a href=""#R32"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R32"">Coffman et al., 2017</a>; <a href=""#R104"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R104"">Haigh et al., 2017b</a>; <a href=""#R242"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R242"">Salisbury et al., 2020a</a>) or local-global (<a href=""#R169"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R169"">Kirihara et al., 2020</a>) paradigms that emphasize PE vs. SSA models. To the extent that these have been studied, effect sizes are similar to those in simpler paradigms (<a href=""#R7"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R7"">Avissar et al., 2018</a>), supporting the importance of mnemonic-based models for underlying basic auditory dysfunction in schizophrenia.</p>"
"<p id=""P38"">Further information regarding the nature of early auditory processing deficits can be obtained using time-frequency (TF) analyses of ERP data. In TF analyses, the electrophysiological activity is decomposed according to underlying frequency content. Canonical frequency ranges include delta (.5–4 Hz), theta (4–8 Hz), alpha (8–12 Hz), beta (12–24 Hz) and gamma (&gt;24 Hz). Critical measures derived from TF analyses include evoked power, which is derived from the average response, and both intertrial coherence (ITC) and total power, which are derived from processing of responses to individual stimuli. TF analyses permit greater insights into the local circuit and cellular processes that give rise to the time-domain ERP waveform findings (<a href=""#R143"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R143"">Javitt et al., 2020</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P39"">In TF analyses, MMN maps primarily to the theta frequency range (<a href=""#R83"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R83"">Fuentemilla et al., 2008</a>; <a href=""#R142"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R142"">Javitt et al., 2000b</a>; <a href=""#R148"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R148"">Jin et al., 2014</a>), as do MMN deficits in schizophrenia (<a href=""#R119"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R119"">Hochberger et al., 2018</a>; <a href=""#R133"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R133"">Javitt, 2000</a>; <a href=""#R140"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R140"">Javitt et al., 2018</a>; <a href=""#R162"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R162"">Kaser et al., 2013</a>; <a href=""#R187"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R187"">Lee et al., 2017</a>; <a href=""#R290"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R290"">Xiong et al., 2019</a>) (<a href=""#F2"" class=""usa-link"">Fig. 2E</a>), which strongly implicates the function of circuits involving somatostatin-type interneurons (<a href=""#R110"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R110"">Hamm and Yuste, 2016</a>; <a href=""#R143"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R143"">Javitt et al., 2020</a>; <a href=""#R288"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R288"">Womelsdorf et al., 2014</a>). In contrast, responses to rapidly presented standard stimuli map primarily to the alpha frequency range. Similarly, an early alpha response can also be resolved prior to MMN in the difference waveforms (<a href=""#F2"" class=""usa-link"">Fig. 2E</a>). As with the subsequent theta-frequency responses, alpha frequency responses are reduced to both standard and deviant stimuli in schizophrenia (<a href=""#R186"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R186"">Lee et al., 2018b</a>; <a href=""#R251"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R251"">Sehatpour et al., 2020</a>), suggesting that inputs into auditory cortex may be impaired as well as local cortical processing. TF analyses are relatively preserved across species, and thus enable parallel preclinical studies to evaluate the cellular and molecular level changes that may underlie auditory processing impairments in schizophrenia (see <a href=""#S22"" class=""usa-link"">Section 4</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P40"">The auditory cortex was traditionally thought to be functionally and structurally “fixed” after critical periods early in life (<a href=""#R117"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R117"">Hensch, 2005</a>). However, along with other cortical regions, the auditory cortex remains highly plastic into adulthood, leading to the ability to refine discrimination ability with repeated exposure (rev. in <a href=""#R82"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R82"">Froemke et al., 2013</a>; <a href=""#R130"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R130"">Irvine, 2018</a>). Auditory plasticity is commonly assessed using an auditory remediation (AudRem) paradigm originally developed for dyslexia (<a href=""#R4"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R4"">Ahissar et al., 2006</a>). In the AudRem approach, participants are presented with paired tones [e.g., S1 (“reference”) and S2 (“test”) separated by 1800 ms and indicate which tone is higher in pitch. In the first pair the ratio between tones (<strong>Δf</strong>) is 50% (e.g., 1000 vs. 500 Hz). Feedback is then given after each trial, and %Δf values are modulated using a staircase procedure to maintain a constant level of accuracy. Two conditions are used. In the random condition (<a href=""#F3"" class=""usa-link"">Fig. 3A</a>), the pitch of the S1 varies randomly across trials, preventing learning of specific pitch differences. Conversely, in the fixed condition, the pitch of the S1 tone remains constant, leading to improved performance (i.e., auditory learning) over repeated trials (<a href=""#F3"" class=""usa-link"">Fig. 3B</a>).</p>"

"<p id=""P41"">In dyslexia, individuals show intact performance in the random condition, but impaired performance in the fixed condition, which has been associated with a faster decay rate of the implicit memory trace in primary and secondary auditory regions (<a href=""#R4"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R4"">Ahissar et al., 2006</a>; <a href=""#R132"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R132"">Jaffe-Dax et al., 2018</a>). In contrast, schizophrenia is associated with impaired performance in both the random condition, reflecting ongoing EAP disturbance, and the fixed condition, representing additional deficits in auditory plasticity (<a href=""#F3"" class=""usa-link"">Fig. 3A</a>–<a href=""#F3"" class=""usa-link"">D</a>). Deficits, as in dyslexia, correlate with impairments in working memory, auditory emotion recognition and reading ability (<a href=""#F3"" class=""usa-link"">Fig. 3E</a>–<a href=""#F3"" class=""usa-link"">G</a>) (<a href=""#R155"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R155"">Kantrowitz et al., 2016</a>). In concurrent ERP recordings, presentation of both the S1 and S2 potentials were associated with sensory responses that mapped primarily into the theta-frequency range and were significantly reduced in schizophrenia. In single-trial analyses, the impairments were associated with reductions in ITC and single-trial power across both alpha and theta frequency ranges, supporting the concept that the behavioral deficits in schizophrenia are associated with impaired processing of the sensory stimuli (<a href=""#R155"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R155"">Kantrowitz et al., 2016</a>). The ERP version of this paradigm thus provides additional neurophysiological targets for treatment development.</p>"
"<p id=""P42"">Additional auditory neurophysiological paradigms in schizophrenia include the auditory P300, P1/N1 and ASSR responses, which provide complementary information with regard to task-dependent versus passive auditory processing.</p>"
"<p id=""P43"">The auditory P300 (P3) potential is elicited in an “active” oddball paradigm, in which participants are asked to attend and respond (e.g., by button press) to the deviant stimulus. The P3 response is conventionally divided into a P3a component that has primarily a frontal distribution and relates primarily to novelty processing, and a P3b component that shows a distributed frontal, temporal and parietal distribution and may reflect “context updating” following correct detection of the deviant stimulus (<a href=""#R230"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R230"">Polich, 2007</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P44"">Auditory P3 deficits in schizophrenia were first demonstrated the early 1970’s (<a href=""#R240"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R240"">Roth and Cannon, 1972</a>) and have been replicated repeatedly since (e.g. (<a href=""#R147"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R147"">Jeon and Polich, 2003</a>; <a href=""#R284"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R284"">Wang et al., 2022</a>)). Unlike MMN, however, P3 reductions may not be associated with functional disability (<a href=""#R106"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R106"">Hamilton et al., 2018b</a>). In CHR individuals, P3, like MMN, may reflect resilience as reflected in greater likelihood to remit and reduced likelihood to convert (<a href=""#R107"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R107"">Hamilton et al., 2019</a>; <a href=""#R109"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R109"">Hamilton et al., 2021</a>; <a href=""#R193"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R193"">Lepock et al., 2018</a>). In biotyping studies, reduced P3 amplitude is a hallmark of biotype I psychosis, which overwhelmingly includes individuals with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder (<a href=""#R30"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R30"">Clementz et al., 2022</a>). Reduced P3 is observed as well in unaffected relatives of people with schizophrenia, suggesting that it may serve as a useful endophenotype (<a href=""#R64"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R64"">Earls et al., 2016</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P45"">More recently, P3 deficits in schizophrenia have been shown to correlate with impaired delta frequency entrainment to the stimulus sequence, suggesting potential low-level mechanisms underlying the widespread cortical activation impairment (<a href=""#R183"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R183"">Lakatos et al., 2013</a>). As compared to MMN, which is sensitive primarily to effects of NMDAR antagonists (<a href=""#R115"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R115"">Heekeren et al., 2008</a>; <a href=""#R276"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R276"">Umbricht et al., 2000</a>; <a href=""#R277"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R277"">Umbricht et al., 2003</a>).

"<p id=""P46"">Both the P1 and N1 (N100) potentials index obligatory brain responses to isolated auditory stimuli. Auditory P1 (also termed P50) shows refractoriness intervals of <sup>~</sup>1 sec, and thus is frequently studied using sensory gating approaches in which pairs of tones are presented following brief intervening delay. P50 gating is best defined as the amplitude of the response to the first stimulus (S1) covaried for the response to the second stimulus (S2). Deficits in P50 gating are well established in schizophrenia and have been studied most extensively in relationship to nicotinic cholinergic-mediated inhibitory dysfunction (<a href=""#R198"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R198"">Martin and Freedman, 2007</a>) and hippocampal theories (<a href=""#R79"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R79"">Freedman et al., 2020</a>; <a href=""#R138"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R138"">Javitt and Freedman, 2015</a>) of schizophrenia, but may be sensitive as well to NMDAR antagonists (<a href=""#R48"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R48"">de la Salle et al., 2022</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P47"">Auditory N1 shows a characteristic refractoriness function such that N1 is reduced exponentially at interstimulus interval (ISIs) of &lt;6 sec.

In healthy volunteers, N1 amplitude is reduced during vocalization or self-triggered tone delivery.

As opposed to generators for MMN, primary generators for the auditory N1 are located primarily within infragranular layers, supporting the concept that differential neuronal populations underlie auditory N1 refractoriness and MMN generation (<a href=""#R135"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R135"">Javitt, 2015</a>; <a href=""#R144"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R144"">Javitt et al., 1996</a>; <a href=""#R182"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R182"">Lakatos et al., 2020</a>).</p>"

Layer III PCs in primary auditory cortex (A1) send local intralaminar projections to other layer III PCs in this region and longer-range feedforward projections to PCs in layer III of auditory association cortex (A2). Layer V PCs in A2 in turn send excitatory feedback projections to neurons in layer I in A1. Structural alterations are indicated. {Adapted from \Parker, 2017 #123}. <strong>B.</strong> A schematic illustration of a proposed model of mismatch negativity (MMN) process related to N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) function. Surface-recorded MMN activity reflects current flow through open, unblocked NMDA receptors on pyramidal neurons in the auditory cortex. In panel 1, NMDAR are normally blocked by Mg<sup>2+</sup> at resting membrane potential. In panel 2, when a deviant stimulus is presented without prior standard stimuli, even though the channels open, the blockade prevents current flow. Brain responses therefore occur only through non-NMDAR glutamate receptors. In panel 3, when repetitive standard stimuli are presented, they lead to subthreshold membrane depolarization by inhibition of inhibition , leading to unblocking of the channel. In panel 4, once channels are unblocked, presentation of the deviant stimulus leads to NMDAR-mediated current flow (adapted from <a href=""#R146"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R146"">Javitt and Sweet, 2015</a>). <strong>B.</strong> A schematic illustration of the MMN process in the NMDA receptor.

"<p id=""P50"">Human thalamic MGN is divided into a matrix subregion that projects widely across auditory and motor regions and targets supragranular layers of auditory cortex and a core subregion that projects more specifically to the granular layers of auditory cortex. A1 afferents deriving from the MGN matrix are more sensitive to rhythm and intensity (<a href=""#R150"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R150"">Jones, 1998</a>, <a href=""#R151"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R151"">2002</a>, <a href=""#R152"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R152"">2009</a>), while inputs deriving from the MGN core have a stronger tonotopic organization (<a href=""#R100"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R100"">Griffiths, 2003</a>; <a href=""#R280"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R280"">Viaene et al., 2011</a>). The EA cortex has a tonotopic organization, in which neurophysiological responses to simple auditory stimuli are elicited in a lateral to medial gradient with increasing frequency (<a href=""#R65"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R65"">Ehret and Romand, 1997</a>; <a href=""#R229"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R229"">Poeppel et al., 2012</a>). Thalamic inputs into auditory cortex derive from both the core (lemniscal) and matrix (non-lemniscal) pathways. In schizophrenia, spine density is reduced in thalamocortical recipient layers of auditory cortex (<a href=""#R264"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R264"">Sweet et al., 2009</a>). The distribution of synaptic sizes, moreover, suggests that reductions may be due to long-term depression processes rather than pruning (<a href=""#R205"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R205"">McKinney et al., 2019</a>), and thus could potentially be rescued during early phases of the illness by appropriate behavioral or pharmacological intervention.</p>"
"<p id=""P51"">The pattern of neurophysiological dysfunction observed in schizophrenia may provide additional information regarding potential contributions of thalamo-cortical dysfunction. For example, a recent meta-analysis of MMN studies in schizophrenia observed that all simple deviant tones (frequency, duration, intensity) demonstrate deficit with moderate to large effect sizes ranking in the following order: duration, pitch, intensity (<a href=""#R7"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R7"">Avissar et al., 2018</a>), suggesting differential neural encoding deficits across features in echoic memory. A potential mechanism underlying this pattern in human is that “non-lemniscal” auditory inputs to the auditory cortex deriving from the thalamic matrix may be preferentially involved in MMN duration deficits, while “lemniscal” inputs deriving from the thalamic core may be additionally involved in MMN pitch impairments (<a href=""#R186"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R186"">Lee et al., 2018b</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P52"">This can potentially be explained by the stronger sensitivity to rhythm shown by non-lemniscal-, in comparison to lemniscal-, inputs (<a href=""#R150"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R150"">Jones, 1998</a>, <a href=""#R151"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R151"">2002</a>, <a href=""#R152"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R152"">2009</a>), and the stronger tonotopic organization of the lemniscal vs. non-lemniscal pathway (<a href=""#R123"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R123"">Hu, 2003</a>; <a href=""#R280"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R280"">Viaene et al., 2011</a>). Therefore, in schizophrenia, it is possible that the frequency impairment relates to more advanced stages of thalamic alteration. Accordingly, this impairment may add to the duration deficit in only a subset of individuals, thereby explaining lower pitch vs. duration mean deficits (<a href=""#R186"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R186"">Lee et al., 2018b</a>). Alternatively, it has been suggested that duration MMN is more affected by illness duration than frequency MMN, so that differential impairments may be most evidence in more chronic individuals (<a href=""#R275"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R275"">Umbricht and Krljes, 2005</a>). Regarding intensity, it has been shown that a clear reduction in the event-related potential MMN to intensity deviants is observed early in the illness but not in later stages of evolution (<a href=""#R272"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R272"">Todd et al., 2008</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P53"">Reduced MGN volume has been reported in schizophrenia, especially in individuals with persistent auditory hallucinations (<a href=""#R225"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R225"">Perez-Rando et al., 2022</a>), but no information is available regarding differential MGN projection systems. Intact thalamocortical boutons are observed in post-mortem auditory cortex in schizophrenia. Neveretheless, a consistent reduction in dendritic spine density is observed in lower layer 3, which mediates feedforward processing (<a href=""#R205"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R205"">McKinney et al., 2019</a>) (<a href=""#F4"" class=""usa-link"">Fig. 4A</a>). In addition, reduced mitochondrial levels are observed, suggestive of reduced pre-synaptic activity (<a href=""#R196"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R196"">MacDonald et al., 2020</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P54"">These findings are consistent with several studies involving different clinical pictures across the psychotic continuum that show global grey matter loss and abnormal functional connectivity encompassing all areas of the auditory cortices in at-risk individuals (<a href=""#R12"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R12"">Bhojraj et al., 2011</a>; <a href=""#R204"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R204"">McKechanie et al., 2016</a>), first-episode (<a href=""#R177"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R177"">Kubicki et al., 2002</a>; <a href=""#R203"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R203"">McCarley et al., 2002</a>) and established schizophrenia participants (<a href=""#R84"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R84"">Fusar-Poli et al., 2011</a>). In addition, these findings are thus consistent with impaired inputs into auditory cortex in schizophrenia.</p>"
"<p id=""P55"">One of the best-replicated features of MMN is its dependence on NMDAR-mediated processes. The ability of NMDAR antagonists to inhibit MMN generation was first demonstrated in monkeys in 1996 (<a href=""#R144"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R144"">Javitt et al., 1996</a>) and subsequently confirmed in humans (<a href=""#R105"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R105"">Hamilton et al., 2018a</a>; <a href=""#R237"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R237"">Rosburg and Kreitschmann-Andermahr, 2016</a>; <a href=""#R276"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R276"">Umbricht et al., 2000</a>), additional monkey (<a href=""#R89"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R89"">Gil-da-Costa et al., 2013</a>; <a href=""#R182"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R182"">Lakatos et al., 2020</a>) and rodents studies (<a href=""#R66"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R66"">Ehrlichman et al., 2008</a>; <a href=""#R69"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R69"">Featherstone et al., 2018</a>; <a href=""#R70"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R70"">Featherstone et al., 2014</a>; <a href=""#R111"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R111"">Harms, 2016</a>; <a href=""#R185"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R185"">Lee et al., 2018a</a>; <a href=""#R239"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R239"">Ross and Hamm, 2020</a>; <a href=""#R248"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R248"">Schuelert et al., 2018</a>). NMDAR dysfunction has also been shown to be consistent with changes observed in predictive coding models of MMN dysfunction (<a href=""#R246"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R246"">Schmidt et al., 2013</a>; <a href=""#R282"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R282"">Wacongne, 2016</a>). Conversely, MMN deficits in schizophrenia and animal models may be ameliorated by NMDAR-targeted treatments including glycine (<a href=""#R97"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R97"">Greenwood et al., 2018</a>; <a href=""#R185"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R185"">Lee et al., 2018a</a>) , D-serine (<a href=""#R155"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R155"">Kantrowitz et al., 2016</a>; <a href=""#R156"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R156"">Kantrowitz et al., 2018</a>), Luvadaxistat (<a href=""#R218"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R218"">O'Donnell et al., 2021</a>), and N-acetylcysteine (<a href=""#R184"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R184"">Lavoie et al., 2008</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P56"">The involvement of NMDAR in MMN generation converges with conceptualizations of MMN as a “Hebbian” process, in which information must be integrated from two distinct information streams: one that integrates the recent auditory history and general state variables, and one that represents the most recent auditory stimulus (<a href=""#R133"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R133"">Javitt, 2000</a>; <a href=""#R146"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R146"">Javitt and Sweet, 2015</a>). NMDAR are well suited to perform Hebbian integration due to their dual voltage- and ligand-dependence, such that current flow through NMDAR occurs only if local subthreshold depolarization coincides with presynaptic glutamate release (<a href=""#R40"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R40"">Cotman and Monaghan, 1988</a>; <a href=""#R200"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R200"">Matsuzaki et al., 2004</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P57"">In the case of MMN, a parsimonious model is that the recent auditory history is maintained as a pattern of distributed subthreshold neuronal depolarizations, and that MMN is then triggered when input to the neuron coincides with the ongoing depolarization (<a href=""#F4"" class=""usa-link"">Fig. 4B</a>). In addition, current flow through open, unblocked NMDAR triggers plasticity processes that may either decrease (long-term depression) and increase (long-term potentiation) of local synaptic strength (<a href=""#R223"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R223"">Park et al., 2022</a>). Thus, NMDAR activation may underlie both the MMN generation (<a href=""#R138"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R138"">Javitt and Freedman, 2015</a>; <a href=""#R144"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R144"">Javitt et al., 1996</a>; <a href=""#R146"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R146"">Javitt and Sweet, 2015</a>) and the plasticity events (<a href=""#R246"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R246"">Schmidt et al., 2013</a>; <a href=""#R282"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R282"">Wacongne, 2016</a>) that are thought to contribute to MMN dysfunction in schizophrenia.</p>"
"<p id=""P58"">In monkeys, MMN has been localized to supragranular layers of auditory cortex (<a href=""#R141"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R141"">Javitt et al., 1992</a>; <a href=""#R144"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R144"">Javitt et al., 1996</a>; <a href=""#R182"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R182"">Lakatos et al., 2020</a>), which are known to be under tonic inhibitory control by several classes of spontaneously active inhibitory interneurons. Moreover, monkey MMN may be inhibited by ketamine administration, providing a pattern of deficit similar to that observed in schizophrenia (<a href=""#F4"" class=""usa-link"">Fig. 4C</a>). Moreover, in both monkeys and rodents, MMN is associated with increased theta frequency activity to deviant vs. standard stimuli that is inhibited by NMDAR antagonist administration (<a href=""#F4"" class=""usa-link"">Fig. 4D</a>). This inhibition is prevented by simultaneous administration of the NMDAR modulator glycine (<a href=""#R185"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R185"">Lee et al., 2018a</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P59"">NMDAR dysfunction may also contribute to disturbances in auditory N1, ASSR and P3 deficits in schizophrenia (<a href=""#R10"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R10"">Balla et al., 2020</a>; <a href=""#R49"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R49"">de la Salle et al., 2021</a>; <a href=""#R249"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R249"">Schwertner et al., 2018</a>). As with MMN, auditory N1 can be modelled in rodents (<a href=""#R185"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R185"">Lee et al., 2018a</a>; <a href=""#R248"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R248"">Schuelert et al., 2018</a>) and primates (<a href=""#R122"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R122"">Holliday et al., 2018</a>; <a href=""#R146"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R146"">Javitt and Sweet, 2015</a>; <a href=""#R269"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R269"">Teichert, 2017</a>) and is sensitive to the effects of both NMDAR antagonists such as ketamine, PCP or MK-801(<a href=""#R185"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R185"">Lee et al., 2018a</a>; <a href=""#R248"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R248"">Schuelert et al., 2018</a>; <a href=""#R269"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R269"">Teichert, 2017</a>) and agonists such as glycine (<a href=""#R185"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R185"">Lee et al., 2018a</a>) or iclepertin (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/BI425809"" class=""usa-link"" data-ga-action=""click_feat_suppl"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">BI425809</a>) (<a href=""#R238"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R238"">Rosenbrock et al., 2022</a>). Administration of ketamine to healthy volunteers also reproduces the pattern of corollary discharge deficits observed on N1 generation in schizophrenia (<a href=""#R170"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R170"">Kort et al., 2017</a>), further supporting the relevance of NMDAR to predictive coding deficits in schizophrenia.</p>"
"<p id=""P60"">Scalp-recorded ERP such as MMN or N1 reflect current flow primarily within the dendritic trees of cortical pyramidal neurons. Nevertheless, activity is regulated by multiple populations of inhibitory interneurons that exert both local inhibition and local disinhibition.</p>"
"<p id=""P61"">The best studied interneuron types are differentiated based on expression of parvalbumin (PV) or somatostatin (SOM, SST). These neurons show differential circuit motifs, such that PV interneurons are preferentially involved in generation of high-frequency (beta/gamma) activity, whereas SOM interneurons are preferentially involved in imposing lower-frequency firing patterns on local pyramidal neurons (<a href=""#R143"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R143"">Javitt et al., 2020</a>; <a href=""#R288"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R288"">Womelsdorf et al., 2014</a>). Thus, PV interneurons may be differentially important in mediating ASSR deficits in schizophrenia (e.g. <a href=""#R93"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R93"">Gonzalez-Burgos et al., 2010</a>; <a href=""#R113"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R113"">Hashimoto et al., 2003</a>; <a href=""#R207"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R207"">Metzner et al., 2019</a>), whereas SOM interneurons may contribute preferentially to deficits in the generation of lower-frequency components such as MMN (<a href=""#R140"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R140"">Javitt et al., 2018</a>; <a href=""#R279"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R279"">Van Derveer et al., 2021</a>). In schizophrenia, reductions in expression of glutamate decarboxylase (GAD67) levels within PV interneurons are observed throughout cortex (<a href=""#R93"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R93"">Gonzalez-Burgos et al., 2010</a>; <a href=""#R113"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R113"">Hashimoto et al., 2003</a>), as are reductions in SOM interneurons and SOM mRNA expression (rev.in <a href=""#R295"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R295"">Zhang et al., 2021</a>). Reductions in PV interneurons are observed as well as in subcortical regions such as inferior colliculus (<a href=""#R167"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R167"">Kilonzo et al., 2020</a>). Consistent with this, reductions in auditory cortex GABA levels have been reported based upon MR spectroscopy (<a href=""#R6"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R6"">Atagun et al., 2017</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P62"">Both PV and SOM interneurons may be divided into functional distinct subcategories. PV interneurons may be divided into basket cells, which target the cell body and dendrites of excitatory interneurons, and chandelier cells, which target the axon initial segment (<a href=""#R263"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R263"">Studer and Barkat, 2021</a>). Both populations have been implicated in cortical dysfunction in schizophrenia, along with surrounding perineuronal nets (<a href=""#R91"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R91"">Glausier and Lewis, 2018</a>; <a href=""#R207"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R207"">Metzner et al., 2019</a>). SOM interneurons may be divided into non-Martinotti and Martinotti subtypes. Non-Martinotti cells are localized primarily with granular and low supragranular cortical layers and mediate inhibition primarily within a cortical column (<a href=""#R236"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R236"">Riedemann, 2019</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P63"">Conversely, Martinotti cells send ascending axons that ramify in layer 1 and project widely across cortical columns, and may additionally express neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) (<a href=""#R236"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R236"">Riedemann, 2019</a>; <a href=""#R257"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R257"">Smiley et al., 2000</a>). Both PV and SOM interneurons target primarily cortical pyramidal neurons. Layer 1 of auditory cortex is also a zone of convergence for many projection systems and interneuron types that may be of relevance to MMN. These include long-range GABAergic projects from Martinotti cells that uniquely cross isofrequency bands in auditory cortex and thus permit synthesis of cross-frequency information, and multiple local interneuron types (rev. in <a href=""#R136"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R136"">Javitt, 2022</a>; <a href=""#R263"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R263"">Studer and Barkat, 2021</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P64"">A third class of interneurons is characterized by expression of 5-HT3 receptors (5-HT3R), and includes subtypes that can be characterized by expression of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) or Neuron-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (NDNF) (<a href=""#R263"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R263"">Studer and Barkat, 2021</a>). VIP interneurons primarily receive input from distant brain regions, project widely across cortical layers and preferentially disinhibits local inhibitory neurons. These neurons may thus play a critical role in top-down regulation of auditory cortex (<a href=""#R180"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R180"">Kullander and Topolnik, 2021</a>) and thus may participate in microcircuits related to auditory impairments in schizophrenia (<a href=""#R239"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R239"">Ross and Hamm, 2020</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P65"">NDNF interneurons are highly localized within layer 1 and mediate prolonged inhibition of cortical pyramidal interneurons. NDNF interneurons in auditory cortex receive primary input from auditory, somatosensory and surrounding temporal lobe regions, and are inhibited by local Martinotti cells, providing a potential local disinhibitory mechanism within supragranular auditory cortex (<a href=""#R1"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R1"">Abs et al., 2018</a>) The potential relevance of 5-HT3R-expressing interneurons is supported by the recent demonstration that the 5-HT3R antagonist CVN058 significant enhances MMN generation in schizophrenia (<a href=""#R254"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R254"">Sehatpour et al., 2022</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P66"">Nevertheless, characterization of E/I processes in schizophrenia remains challenging because of the significant heterogeneity of function even within the broader cell-type divisions (<a href=""#R72"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R72"">Field et al., 2021</a>), and the potential differential properties of GABA interneurons in humans vs. rodents (<a href=""#R120"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R120"">Hodge et al., 2019</a>). The role of NMDAR in modulation of different GABA interneuron types is also incompletely understood. Nevertheless, large NMDAR-mediated responses have been documented in multiple interneuron classes including VIP- and neurogliaform cells as well as the more widely studied PV and SOM interactions (<a href=""#R18"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R18"">Booker and Wyllie, 2021</a>), suggesting that NMDAR dysfunction may lead to complex changes in E/I balance.</p>"
"<p id=""P67"">Acetylcholine (ACh) has been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia based on both genetics and the high-rate of smoking observed in schizophrenia (rev. in <a href=""#R54"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R54"">Donde et al., 2020b</a>; <a href=""#R71"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R71"">Featherstone and Siegel, 2015</a>; <a href=""#R78"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R78"">Freedman, 2014</a>; <a href=""#R273"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R273"">Tregellas and Wylie, 2019</a>). Furthermore, nicotine has been shown to enhance MMN in healthy individuals (e.g. <a href=""#R9"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R9"">Baldeweg et al., 2006</a>; <a href=""#R197"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R197"">Martin et al., 2009</a>), although results have been conflicting across studies (e.g. <a href=""#R54"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R54"">Donde et al., 2020b</a>; <a href=""#R128"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R128"">Inami et al., 2007</a>; <a href=""#R199"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R199"">Mathalon et al., 2014</a>; <a href=""#R258"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R258"">Smith et al., 2015</a>). In one study that evaluated the interactive effects of ketamine and nicotine in healthy volunteers, ketamine reduced and nicotine enhanced MMN when given separately, but nicotine did not reverse the effects of ketamine, arguing against a potential therapeutic effect in schizophrenia (<a href=""#R105"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R105"">Hamilton et al., 2018a</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P68"">In schizophrenia, the effects of nicotine have also been mixed (rev. in <a href=""#R54"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R54"">Donde et al., 2020b</a>). In one study, no significant effects of nicotine were observed on MMN latency in a group of 10 non-smoking individuals with schizophrenia (<a href=""#R128"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R128"">Inami et al., 2007</a>), although a subsequent study showed nicotine-induced enhancement of duration but not frequency MMN in a group of 12 smokers with schizophrenia (<a href=""#R61"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R61"">Dulude et al., 2010</a>). In a study of 12 schizophrenia outpatients with persistent auditory hallucinations, nicotine did not significantly affect MMN amplitude to frequency, duration or intensity deviants, although nicotine-related changes in MMN correlated with nicotine-induced changes in hallucination severity (<a href=""#R73"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R73"">Fisher et al., 2012</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P69"">Mixed results have also been reported with high-affinity α7 nicotinic ligands. Several studies have reported improvement in P50 gating with nicotinic compounds. In addition one study found a significant dose-dependent improvement in MMN and other auditory ERP measures following 21-day treatment with the EVP-6124 (Encenicline),an α7 positive allosteric modulator (<a href=""#R231"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R231"">Preskorn et al., 2014</a>), A phase II study with the compound showed significant beneficial effects against persistent cognitive and negative symptoms in schizophrenia (<a href=""#R165"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R165"">Keefe et al., 2015</a>), although subsequent phase III studies showed no significant benefits (<a href=""#R19"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R19"">Brannan, 2019</a>). Most recently, no significant change in MMN, symptoms or cognition was observed in a study of AVL-3288, an α7 nicotinic positive allosteric modulator, in 24 non-smoking schizophrenia individuals (<a href=""#R159"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R159"">Kantrowitz et al., 2020</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P70"">In general, studies with nicotine in both schizophrenia and control individuals have been small, limiting statistical power. Furthermore, desensitization effects may limit efficacy of nicotinic compounds during chronic administration (rev. in <a href=""#R54"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R54"">Donde et al., 2020b</a>). Although the present literature does not support the use of α7 agonists in schizophrenia overall, it remains an open question as to whether individuals with EAP deficits (e.g. impaired MMN) may show selective benefit.</p>"
"<p id=""P71"">In addition to serving as translational biomarkers, measures of EAP dysfunction may also help refine overall theories of cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia and may serve as both stratification biomarkers to assist in defining etiologically distinct subpopulations, and as target-engagement measures to assist in identification of potential plasticity-enhancing agents in schizophrenia.</p>"
"<p id=""P72"">Although the overall architecture of cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia is still under investigation, the field is increasingly moving from regional to distributed models of dysfunction. In the distributed hierarchical concept, the basic molecular and cellular substrates of cognitive dysfunction such as NMDAR dysfunction are considered to be distributed throughout cortex, leading to disturbances in specific types of processing (e.g., long-term potentiation, non-linear gain) that are regionally diffuse but process-specific (<a href=""#F5"" class=""usa-link"">Fig 5A</a>). Such models are supported both by genetic studies, in which risk genes for schizophrenia (e.g., GluN2a, setd1a) are widely distributed across cortical and subcortical regions, and postmortem studies showing similar histological abnormalities in sensory and cognitive brain regions. In distributed hierarchical models, disturbances in higher order processing are considered to reflect both impaired local dysfunction within specific higher order brain regions and impaired bottom-up input to those regions.</p>"

"<p id=""P73"">Studies of auditory function strongly support such models both within auditory regions and across cortical areas. For instance, within the auditory system pitch discrimination impairments as indexed by TMT were found to significantly predict impairment on a more complex serial pitch-pattern detection task, which, in turn, predicted impaired AER, with increasing effect size across processes. Moreover, the effects of tone matching on AER were fully mediated by the pitch pattern discrimination task (<a href=""#R60"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R60"">Donde et al., 2019f</a>). Similarly, deficits in simple tone matching may contribute to incorrect sourcing of perceptual material or source-monitoring, which in turn may contribute to the pathogenesis of auditory hallucinations (<a href=""#R59"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R59"">Donde et al., 2019e</a>). MMN impairments are reported as well in children with specific language impairment (<a href=""#R179"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R179"">Kujala and Leminen, 2017</a>), suggesting that impairments in these circuits may contribute as well to NMDAR-related language disturbances in schizophrenia (<a href=""#R3"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R3"">Adler et al., 1999</a>; <a href=""#R37"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R37"">Corcoran et al., 2018a</a>) as well.</p>"
"<p id=""P74"">Specific processes that may mediate the interrelationships between impairments in early auditory processing and functional outcome include detection of either emotional (<a href=""#R56"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R56"">Donde et al., 2019b</a>; <a href=""#R60"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R60"">Donde et al., 2019f</a>; <a href=""#R92"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R92"">Gold et al., 2012</a>; <a href=""#R157"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R157"">Kantrowitz et al., 2015</a>; <a href=""#R158"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R158"">Kantrowitz et al., 2014a</a>; <a href=""#R188"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R188"">Leitman et al., 2005</a>; <a href=""#R189"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R189"">Leitman et al., 2010a</a>; <a href=""#R191"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R191"">Leitman et al., 2011</a>; <a href=""#R192"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R192"">Leitman et al., 2006</a>) or attitudinal (<a href=""#R158"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R158"">Kantrowitz et al., 2014a</a>; <a href=""#R192"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R192"">Leitman et al., 2006</a>) prosody (“tone of voice”), which will affect social cognition; or impairment in phonological language processing, which affects educational and occupational function (<a href=""#R26"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R26"">Carrion et al., 2015</a>; <a href=""#R56"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R56"">Donde et al., 2019b</a>; <a href=""#R80"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R80"">Friedman et al., 2012</a>; <a href=""#R234"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R234"">Revheim et al., 2006</a>; <a href=""#R235"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R235"">Revheim et al., 2014</a>) (<a href=""#F5"" class=""usa-link"">Fig. 5A</a>,<a href=""#F5"" class=""usa-link"">B</a>). In tonal languages, such as Mandarin, deficits in tonal processing may lead to impaired word identification, which, in turn, undermines occupational outcome in patients (<a href=""#R291"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R291"">Yang et al., 2012</a>). At the neurophysiological level, deficits in MMN generation account for <sup>~</sup>50% of the variance in generation of the attention-dependent auditory P300 potential (<a href=""#R190"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R190"">Leitman et al., 2010b</a>), with the remaining variance potentially mediated by impairments in other components of auditory processing such as active auditory entrainment (<a href=""#R190"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R190"">Leitman et al., 2010b</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P75"">Similar hierarchical disturbances are also observed in larger scale studies that incorporate a larger range of measures. For example, in one study involving 1415 individuals with schizophrenia, deficits in EAP, as reflected primarily by impaired MMN generation, had a direct effect on overall cognition, which in turn contributed significantly to negative symptoms. Both cognition and experiential negative symptoms, in turn, predicted functional outcome, as reflected in social and occupational function (<a href=""#R270"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R270"">Thomas et al., 2017</a>). These findings were replicated in a more recent study of 695 schizophrenia individuals and 503 healthy comparators in which sensory discrimination, as operationalized by MMN and P3a, and gamma-band dysfunction, as operationalized using ASSR, contributed in parallel to cognition, which along with sensory discrimination, contributed significantly to negative symptoms. In this latter study, no direct link between cognition and functional outcome was observed (<a href=""#R172"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R172"">Koshiyama et al., 2021b</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P76"">Finally, although the large majority of auditory studies in schizophrenia focus only on the cortical level, those studies that incorporate indices of subcortical function find similar hierarchical relationships. For example, in invasive electrophysiological (<a href=""#R182"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R182"">Lakatos et al., 2020</a>) and fMRI studies of MMN, deviance-related activity is observed in subcortical structures including inferior colliculus and thalamic MGN (<a href=""#R25"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R25"">Cacciaglia et al., 2015</a>) and is impaired in schizophrenia (<a href=""#R85"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R85"">Gaebler et al., 2020</a>). To the extent that location deficits are larger for inter-aural time delay vs. inter-aural intensity cues (<a href=""#R201"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R201"">Matthews et al., 2013</a>), brainstem processes related to delay detection may also be impaired.</p>"
"<p id=""P77"">Given the relationship between EAP deficits and functional outcome, there has been increasing interest in EAP-targeted interventions (e.g. <a href=""#R13"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R13"">Biagianti et al., 2020</a>; <a href=""#R206"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R206"">Medalia et al., 2019</a>; <a href=""#R281"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R281"">Vinogradov et al., 2012</a>). For example, based upon hierarchical models, it has been estimated that a 1 sd improvement in EAP measures (<sup>~</sup> 1 μV) would produce an improvement of .78 sd for cognition and .28 sd for psychosocial function. At present, the main approaches for intervention include cognitive remediation either alone or combined with pharmacological manipulation. For example, a recent meta-analysis of EAP-targeted remediation studies performed either with the Posit Science Brain Fitness Program or the Phoenix Software Audiolog system calculated mean effect sizes in the range of .5-.9 sd for improvement of auditory function, as well as significant improvements in higher-order cognitive function, although concerns were raised about the durability of the findings (<a href=""#R58"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R58"">Donde et al., 2019d</a>) (<a href=""#F5"" class=""usa-link"">Fig. 5D</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P78"">Studies since then (e.g. (<a href=""#R13"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R13"">Biagianti et al., 2020</a>; <a href=""#R46"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R46"">Dale et al., 2020</a>; <a href=""#R250"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R250"">Scoriels et al., 2020</a>) further support these conclusions (see also <a href=""#R154"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R154"">Kantrowitz, 2019</a>; <a href=""#R211"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R211"">Mondino et al., 2021</a>). In one informative study, participants were first separated into EAP- and EAP+ groups based on tone-matching ability, and then assigned to cognitive remediation that either did (Brain Basics) or did not (Brain Training) include an auditory component. Only individuals with baseline auditory deficits benefited from auditory-training (<a href=""#F5"" class=""usa-link"">Fig. 5C</a>), reinforcing the need to personalize remediation for specific individuals (<a href=""#R206"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R206"">Medalia et al., 2019</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P79"">Given the limited plasticity of auditory cortical function in schizophrenia (<a href=""#F3"" class=""usa-link"">Fig. 3</a>), several studies are also underway to evaluate the ability of combined treatments to facilitate EAP-targeted interventions. Current studies are being conducted with the tool compounds D-serine and memantine. In addition, non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) approaches such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) may increase plasticity and improve benefit.</p>"
"<p id=""P80"">D-serine is an allosteric modulator of NMDAR that acts through the glycine/D-serine recognition site. In an initial study, sequential administration of acute D-serine led to significant reduction in tone-discrimination thresholds to near-control levels for the trained tones. The improvement was associated as well with an increase in theta-band response (theta-ITC) to the S2 stimulus in the tone pair that correlated with clinical improvement. A significant increase was also observed in MMN response to the trained, but not untrained, tone frequency that also correlated with the behavioral improvement (<a href=""#R155"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R155"">Kantrowitz et al., 2016</a>). A more recent study also observed significant dose-dependent D-serine effects on both tone-matching and MMN following acute administration (<a href=""#R47"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R47"">de la Garrigue et al., 2020</a>; Sehatpour et al.). Studies assessing the effects of repeated D-serine administration combined with auditory remediation are presently underway (<a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05046353"" class=""usa-link"" data-ga-action=""click_feat_suppl"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">NCT05046353</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P81"">Memantine is an NMDAR antagonist that acts preferentially at extrasynaptic NMDAR, which in general work in opposition to intrasynaptic receptors (<a href=""#R136"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R136"">Javitt, 2022</a>). Thus, as opposed to other NMDAR antagonists (e.g. ketamine), memantine is neither psychotomimetic nor anti-depressant and functions to improve, rather than reduce, plasticity (rev. in <a href=""#R136"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R136"">Javitt, 2022</a>). Although memantine is used most commonly in Alzheimer disease, it is also reported to have pro-cognitive effects in schizophrenia and to improve MMN generation (<a href=""#R265"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R265"">Swerdlow et al., 2016</a>), oscillatory dynamics (<a href=""#R195"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R195"">Light et al., 2017</a>) and E/I balance (<a href=""#R210"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R210"">Molina et al., 2020</a>). Most recently, memantine has been reported to enhance effects of auditory training (<a href=""#R266"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R266"">Swerdlow et al., 2020</a>). As with D-serine, effects of memantine as an adjunct to repeated auditory training remain ongoing (<a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04857983"" class=""usa-link"" data-ga-action=""click_feat_suppl"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">NCT04857983</a>)</p>"
"<p id=""P82"">Augmentation using transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) or other non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS)-based approaches may also be possible (e.g. (<a href=""#R62"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R62"">Dunn et al., 2017</a>)). For example, cathodal tDCS applied to auditory cortex has been observed to reduce auditory hallucinations (<a href=""#R23"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R23"">Brunelin et al., 2012</a>; <a href=""#R161"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R161"">Kantrowitz et al., 2019</a>; <a href=""#R168"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R168"">Kim et al., 2019</a>; <a href=""#R211"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R211"">Mondino et al., 2021</a>) and improve insight (<a href=""#R2"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R2"">Adam et al., 2022</a>), supporting concepts that auditory cortical function may be amenable to intervention using locally targeted approaches.</p>"
"<p id=""P83"">Nevertheless, to date the effects of tDCS on EAP has been investigated to a limited degree. In an initial study of 12 individuals, increases in MMN were observed following anodal stimulation in individuals with reduced pre-stimulation MMN amplitudes (<a href=""#R127"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R127"">Impey and Knott, 2015</a>). Subsequent studies showed differential effects of anodal and cathodal stimulation (<a href=""#R126"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R126"">Impey et al., 2016</a>) and interaction with NMDAR antagonists (<a href=""#R125"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R125"">Impey et al., 2017b</a>), auditory verbal hallucinations and working memory (<a href=""#R124"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R124"">Impey et al., 2017a</a>). Recent MR-guided high-definition tDCS approaches have proven superior to more traditional low-density stimulation (<a href=""#R14"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R14"">Bikson et al., 2018</a>; <a href=""#R24"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R24"">Brunoni et al., 2014</a>; <a href=""#R231"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R231"">Preskorn et al., 2014</a>; <a href=""#R252"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R252"">Sehatpour et al., 2021</a>). Future studies using more personalized and focal approaches might therefore demonstrate even further benefit.</p>"
"<p id=""P84"">EAP deficits are a core feature of schizophrenia and have been shown to contribute to deficits in both social- and neuro-cognition (<a href=""#F5"" class=""usa-link"">Fig. 5D</a>). Nevertheless, assessment of these processes has not yet been incorporated into available neuropsychological batteries such as the MCCB. The strong correlation between EAP deficits and outcome argues for the need of a MATRICS-like process to develop a validated, normed EAP assessment battery that could be used along batteries such as the MCCB to evaluate EAP processing, as supported by recent studies using tone matching to personalize cognitive remediation in both clinical and research settings (<a href=""#R206"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R206"">Medalia et al., 2019</a>; <a href=""#R259"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R259"">Smith et al., 2021</a>). The degree to which EAP deficits are confined to schizophrenia also requires further investigation.</p>"
"<p id=""P85"">At the neurophysiological level, recent findings of impairments in the initial , alpha-frequency response to auditory stimulation in cortex converge with recent findings of reduced dendritic size within post-mortem tissue in schizophrenia. It has further been argued that the pattern of dendritic change is more consistent with LTD-like processes than pruning. To the extent that this is correct, both behavioral and pharmacological approaches to enhance LTP over LTD may provide improved therapeutic outcomes.</p>"
"<p id=""P86"">The ontogeny of EAP deficits in schizophrenia also remains controversial. For example, although one set of studies has documented MMN deficits even prior to illness onset, another set documents normal MMN amplitudes in first-episode patients, with decline over the initial years of illness. These findings raise the possibility that there may be several paths to development of schizophrenia that are captured by MMN and potentially other EAP measures. Nevertheless, further research is needed to reconcile the two sets of findings. To the extent that EAP deficits emerge in the years prior to illness onset in a specific subgroup, early screening, intervention and sensory training remediation strategies are warranted.</p>"
"<p id=""P87"">At the local circuit level, a strength of auditory ERP measures is their translational utility across rodents, monkeys, and humans, which is aided through the use of TF analysis approaches. Neurophysiological deficits in schizophrenia, in general, are considered to arise from E/I imbalance, but the degree to which this involves dysfunction of excitatory vs. inhibitory mechanisms in any individual remains unknown. The clinical interest in auditory ERP measures converges, at present, with advanced conceptualizations of how different GABA-interneuron subtypes contribute to neuro-oscillatory function.</p>"
"<p id=""P88"">Nevertheless, as recently reviewed (<a href=""#R18"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R18"">Booker and Wyllie, 2021</a>; <a href=""#R263"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R263"">Studer and Barkat, 2021</a>), there remain multiple unanswered questions regarding how GABA interneurons in auditory cortex are best categorized, how they interact to permit complex stimulus processing, and how they are modulated by different glutamatergic processes. For example, recent findings with the 5-HT3R antagonist CVN-058(<a href=""#R254"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R254"">Sehatpour et al., 2022</a>) argue for greater research into the role of 5-HT3R expressing interneurons as a therapeutic target. At present, there are few therapeutic strategies in schizophrenia targeting specific interneuron populations. An open question is whether EAP measures can be used to guide future research.</p>"
"<p id=""P89"">Finally, there is a desperate need for biomarkers in psychiatry that can be used to support new treatment development. The ability of NMDAR antagonists and agonists to bidirectionality modulate MMN argues for its use as a pharmacodynamic/target engagement in translational drug development programs.

<p>Schizophrenia is a chronic and complex mental disorder resulting from interactions between cumulative and synergistic genetic and environmental factors. Viral infection during the prenatal stage constitutes one of the most relevant risk factors for the development of schizophrenia later in adulthood.</p>
"<p>A narrative review was conducted to explore the link between viral infections and schizophrenia, as well as the neuropsychiatric effects of antiviral drugs, particularly in the context of this specific mental condition. Literature searches were performed using the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases.</p>"
"<p>Several viral infections, such as herpesviruses, influenza virus, Borna disease virus, and coronaviruses, can directly or indirectly disrupt normal fetal brain development by modifying gene expression in the maternal immune system, thereby contributing to the pathophysiological symptoms of schizophrenia. In addition, neuropsychiatric effects caused by antiviral drugs are frequent and represent significant adverse outcomes for viral treatment.</p>"
"<p>Epidemiological evidence suggests a potential relationship between viruses and schizophrenia. Increases in inflammatory cytokine levels and changes in the expression of key genes observed in several viral infections may constitute potential links between these viral infections and schizophrenia. Furthermore, antivirals may affect the central nervous system, although for most drugs, their mechanisms of action are still unclear, and a strong relationship between antivirals and schizophrenia has not yet been established.</p>"

"<p>The suggestion that microorganisms might provoke psychotic disorders in humans was established a long time ago. In the late nineteenth century, the Germ Theory of Disease was postulated, establishing that bacteria could be the etiologic agents related to several psychiatric disorders, including <em>dementia praecox.</em> At the time, the impossibility of a direct bacterial infection of the brain was verified, but it could occur indirectly through the secretion of microbial toxins in a process known as autointoxication (Yolken &amp; Torrey, <a href=""#r388"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r388"">2008</a>). However, the Theory of Autointoxication fell into disrepute after several researchers attempted to surgically remove the infection sites in various organs, often with tragic results (Noll, <a href=""#r256"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r256"">2006</a>). After the influenza pandemic in 1918–1919, it was found that viral infection caused psychosis in many affected individuals (Menninger, <a href=""#r221"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r221"">1994</a>; Kępińska et al., <a href=""#r179"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r179"">2020</a>). In the 1980s, this virus hypothesis gained renewed attention due to the occurrence of herpesvirus infections in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of schizophrenic subjects (Morozov, <a href=""#r237"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r237"">1983</a>).</p>"
"<p>Despite controversial findings, an extensive corpus of evidence links microbial infections to neuropsychiatric disorders, with host genes influencing microbial virulence and pathogens affecting host genes, including those related to schizophrenia (Krause et al., <a href=""#r189"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r189"">2010</a>; Pouget et al., <a href=""#r273"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r273"">2019</a>; Yolken, <a href=""#r386"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r386"">2023</a>). Furthermore, research on the gut-brain axis shows that bacteria can influence brain function and behavior without directly replicating in the central nervous system (CNS) (Borrego-Ruiz &amp; Borrego, <a href=""#r30"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r30"">2024a</a>; Hashimoto, <a href=""#r144"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r144"">2023</a>). In this regard, the gut microbiome and schizophrenia exhibit a bidirectional relationship, as translocated gut microbial metabolites can negatively impact brain connectivity, inducing neuroinflammation, a critical factor in schizophrenia (Kannan et al., <a href=""#r171"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r171"">2017</a>). In fact, this mental condition can alter the function of endothelial cells and disrupt the permeability of the blood–brain barrier (BBB), causing inflammation and the translocation of inflammatory cells into the brain (Khandaker &amp; Dantzer, <a href=""#r180"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r180"">2016</a>; Severance &amp; Yolken, <a href=""#r310"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r310"">2020</a>).</p>"
"<p>Diverse pathogenic microorganisms have been associated with psychotic symptoms, including those characteristic of schizophrenia. These pathogens encompass (i) bacteria, such as <em>Treponema pallidum, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia trachomatis</em>, and <em>Borrelia burgdorferi</em>; (ii) viruses, such as herpesviruses, orthomyxoviruses, rubiviruses, paramyxoviruses, picornaviruses, poxviruses, enteroviruses, arboviruses, retroviruses, and Borna disease virus; and (iii) protozoa, such as <em>Toxoplasma gondii</em> (Caroff, Mann, Gliatto, Sullivan, &amp; Campbell, <a href=""#r46"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r46"">2001</a>; Yolken &amp; Torrey, <a href=""#r388"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r388"">2008</a>). Although various of these pathogenic microorganisms have been extensively studied, interest has converged on a few viruses (Prasad, Watson, Dickerson, Yolken, &amp; Nimgaonkar, <a href=""#r276"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r276"">2012</a>; Watson et al., <a href=""#r369"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r369"">2013</a>). In addition, a better understanding of neurodevelopment and neuroinflammation has provided insights into how viruses, either alone or in combination with other microorganisms or host variables, may impact the etiopathogenesis of schizophrenia (Meyer, <a href=""#r224"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r224"">2013</a>; Tran, Lee, &amp; Cho, <a href=""#r341"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r341"">2022</a>).</p>"
"<p>Congenital infections are a major cause of childhood neurodevelopmental disabilities, contributing to structural brain abnormalities that can lead to severe impairments such as cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and neurosensory deficits (Fortin &amp; Mulkey, <a href=""#r111"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r111"">2023</a>). Meyer, Yee, &amp; Feldon (<a href=""#r227"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r227"">2007</a>) previously suggested that infection-associated immune events during early fetal life may have a greater neurodevelopmental impact than infections occurring later in pregnancy. This is because infections in early gestation can disrupt key neurodevelopmental processes, such as cell proliferation and differentiation, and may predispose the developing nervous system to subsequent disruptions in cell migration, target selection, and synapse maturation, ultimately leading to a range of brain and behavioral abnormalities in adult offspring. In this regard, evidence suggests that exposure to infectious agents, autoimmune diseases, and other stressors during fetal and postnatal life may contribute to the development of schizophrenia and other non-affective psychoses (Benros, Nielsen, Nordentoft, Eaton, Dalton, &amp; Mortensen, <a href=""#r21"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r21"">2011</a>; Brown &amp; Patterson, <a href=""#r41"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r41"">2011</a>; Dickerson, Severance, &amp; Yolken, <a href=""#r80"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r80"">2017</a>; Eaton et al., <a href=""#r89"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r89"">2006</a>; Megli &amp; Coyne, <a href=""#r220"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r220"">2022</a>; Severance &amp; Yolken, <a href=""#r310"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r310"">2020</a>; Yolken &amp; Torrey, <a href=""#r388"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r388"">2008</a>). Proposed mechanisms include (i) excessive inflammatory cytokine production, contributing to immune dysregulation (Di Nicola et al., <a href=""#r85"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r85"">2013</a>); (ii) early-life disruptions in brain development (Ahmed, Ramadan, Elbeh, &amp; Haridy, <a href=""#r4"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r4"">2024</a>); and (iii) neurotransmitter dysfunction, including glutamate, epinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), driven by cytokine imbalance (Murray et al., <a href=""#r244"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r244"">2004</a>; Potvin et al., <a href=""#r271"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r271"">2008</a>). Within this context, epidemiological studies on maternal infections during pregnancy have provided contradictory results regarding microbial exposure, but have reported consistent associations with <em>T. gondii</em> maternal transmission (Blomström, Gardner, Dalman, Yolken, &amp; Karslsson, <a href=""#r26"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r26"">2015</a>; Cheslack-Postava &amp; Brown, <a href=""#r55"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r55"">2022</a>). Interestingly, other studies indicate that the association between early-life infection and later schizophrenia development is not completely explained by shared familial factors or by genetic liability (Karlsson &amp; Dalman, <a href=""#r173"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r173"">2020</a>; Wahbeh &amp; Avramopoulos, <a href=""#r362"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r362"">2021</a>).</p>"
"<p>Taking into consideration the growing evidence linking viral infections to neuropsychiatric disorders, and recognizing that both viral infections and their treatments may influence brain function, this narrative review synthesizes the current understanding of how viral infections may contribute to the development of schizophrenia, addressing the underlying mechanisms. Additionally, it explores the potential therapeutic impact of antiviral drugs in neuropsychiatric conditions, emphasizing schizophrenia as the primary focus of the review.</p>"
"<p>The present work consists of a narrative review aimed at gathering and analyzing existing literature to offer a comprehensive and thorough overview of the central topic under investigation (Agarwal, Charlesworth, &amp; Elrakhawy, <a href=""#r2"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r2"">2023</a>), which contemplates the link between viral infections and schizophrenia, and also the neuropsychiatric effects of the antiviral drugs, especially on schizophrenia. The authors individually conducted an exhaustive literature search within the field pertinent to the subject of study. With this aim, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched between February and March 2024, using various combinations of keywords related to the research topic, such as “viral infection,” “viruses,” “schizophrenia,” “antivirals,” or “psychiatric disorders.” The search strategy involved an iterative process and also included an examination of the reference list of previous reviews and research papers. Both authors screened all eligible records separately, and each article found was individually assessed for relevance by first screening the title and abstract. Duplicates were removed, as well as articles excluded due to their subject being out of scope for this review. The full texts of the remaining articles were carefully retrieved, and relevant data were extracted for further analysis.</p>"
"<p>Schizophrenia is defined as a severe mental disorder that impacts more than 21 million individuals globally, which is related to chronic disability and to impaired cognitive, emotional, and social abilities (WHO, <a href=""#r372"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r372"">2018</a>). Symptoms of schizophrenia typically appear during adolescence or early adulthood (Orsolini, Pompili, &amp; Volpe, <a href=""#r259"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r259"">2022</a>; Riedmüller &amp; Müller, <a href=""#r290"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r290"">2017</a>) and include positive symptoms (delusional beliefs, hallucinations, and formal thought disorder), negative symptoms (alogia, anhedonia, avolition, and social isolation), and cognitive impairments, including deficits in areas such as attention, working memory, information processing rate, verbal and visuospatial acquisition, analytical reasoning, and cognitive adaptability (Marder &amp; Cannon, <a href=""#r213"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r213"">2019</a>; McCutcheon, Reis Marques, &amp; Howes, <a href=""#r218"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r218"">2020</a>; Moritz, Silverstein, Dietrichkeit, &amp; Gallinat, <a href=""#r235"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r235"">2020</a>; Moura et al., <a href=""#r238"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r238"">2022</a>). In addition, dysfunctions in social cognition (comprising social reasoning, emotional intelligence, emotion detection from facial cues, and general emotion assessment) can markedly hinder the functional recovery of individuals with schizophrenia, due to the adverse effects on interpersonal interactions, community integration, and vocational performance (Green, Lee, &amp; Wynn, <a href=""#r130"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r130"">2020</a>; McCutcheon et al., <a href=""#r218"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r218"">2020</a>). Concomitant occurrence with other mental disorders contributes to elevated incidence of symptom relapse, medical confinement, propensity for suicide, and family and social problems, as well as to a higher risk of negative short-term outcomes, including higher mortality rates (Correll et al., <a href=""#r60"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r60"">2022</a>; Drake, Xie, &amp; McHugo, <a href=""#r86"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r86"">2020</a>; Plana-Ripoll et al., <a href=""#r270"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r270"">2020</a>).</p>"
"<p>Schizophrenia constitutes a syndrome that encompasses a compilation of clinical features stemming from diverse etiologies, etiopathogenesis, and psychopathological processes that may be involved (Barch, Karcher, &amp; Moran, <a href=""#r17"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r17"">2022</a>; Insel, <a href=""#r158"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r158"">2010</a>; van Os, Linscott, Myin-Germeys, Delespaul, &amp; Krabbendam, <a href=""#r357"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r357"">2009</a>). Nevertheless, numerous emerging neurobiological approaches have been recently proposed regarding the pathogenesis of schizophrenia (Chekroud et al., <a href=""#r51"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r51"">2021</a>; DeLisi, <a href=""#r70"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r70"">2022</a>; Nasrallah, <a href=""#r249"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r249"">2022</a>), such as the following: (i) genetic factors implicated in developmental disturbances at different periods of the fetal phase that influence brain programming, leading to the manifestation of prepsychotic features during prepubertal or pubertal stages (Ahmed et al., <a href=""#r4"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r4"">2024</a>; Boog, <a href=""#r29"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r29"">2004</a>); (ii) the neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia, which integrates various non-genetic determinants, including perinatal challenges, immigration status, and traumatic experiences of maltreatment and neglect during the childhood stage, potentially mediating epigenetic modifications and determining structural and functional neurodevelopmental deviations (Powell, <a href=""#r272"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r272"">2010</a>); (iii) pathological changes in several brain areas, encompassing the frontal, parietal, temporal, and cingulate regions, as well as glial components, alongside heightened synaptic pruning and/or perturbed neuroplasticity capability (Chung &amp; Cannon, <a href=""#r56"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r56"">2015</a>); (iv) immune dysfunction and neuroinflammation (Di Nicola et al., <a href=""#r85"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r85"">2013</a>; Kannan et al., <a href=""#r171"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r171"">2017</a>); and (v) various abnormalities in neurotransmitter pathways (Murray et al., <a href=""#r244"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r244"">2004</a>; Nyffeler, Meyer, Yee, Feldon, &amp; Knuesel, <a href=""#r258"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r258"">2006</a>).</p>"
"<p>Recent findings corroborate the notion that schizophrenia is a multifactorial disorder resulting from inextricable interactions between cumulative and synergistic genetic and environmental factors (van Os, Kenis, &amp; Rutten, <a href=""#r358"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r358"">2010</a>), with a highly variable and heterogeneous clinical presentation (Gur, <a href=""#r135"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r135"">2022</a>). Hence, owing to the absence of distinct demarcations and the large amount of involved etiological determinants, pathophysiological processes, and conjectures (Cannon, <a href=""#r44"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r44"">2022</a>; Taghia et al., <a href=""#r332"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r332"">2018</a>; Tandon et al., <a href=""#r336"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r336"">2013</a>), the perspective on schizophrenia has currently been expanded to a spectrum concept in the DSM-5-TR (APA, <a href=""#r9"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r9"">2022</a>), or as a principal psychotic disorder in the ICD-11 (Gaebel &amp; Salveridou-Hof, <a href=""#r113"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r113"">2022</a>; WHO, <a href=""#r373"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r373"">2019</a>).</p>"
"<p>Schizophrenia affects temporal brain regions, such as the hippocampus, which undergo development during prenatal periods and over an extended time frame before the initiation of psychosis (Zaidel, Esiri, &amp; Harrison, <a href=""#r389"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r389"">1997</a>), impeding the multiplication of neurons and the establishment of axial linkages, and thereby resulting in limited CNS development (Kotsiri et al., <a href=""#r190"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r190"">2023</a>; Sanfilipo et al., <a href=""#r300"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r300"">2000</a>). The brain of schizophrenic subjects has shown expansions in the lateral ventricles and a diminished dimension in the frontal and the temporal lobes of the cortex, along with reduced hippocampal size (Sanfilipo et al., <a href=""#r300"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r300"">2000</a>; Thaker &amp; Carpenter, <a href=""#r338"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r338"">2001</a>).</p>"
"<p>Schizophrenia is not considered a neuroinflammatory disease because there is no proof of astrogliosis and microglial activation (De Picker et al., <a href=""#r72"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r72"">2021</a>; Najjar, Pearlman, Alper, Najjar, &amp; Devinsky, <a href=""#r247"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r247"">2013</a>; van Kesteren et al., <a href=""#r356"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r356"">2017</a>), or of lymphocytic infiltration (Bogerts et al., <a href=""#r27"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r27"">2017</a>; Schlaaff et al., <a href=""#r305"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r305"">2020</a>). However, several astrocytic and microglial indicators exhibit dysregulation in schizophrenia (Najjar &amp; Pearlman, <a href=""#r246"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r246"">2015</a>; Najjar et al., <a href=""#r247"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r247"">2013</a>; Ramaker et al., <a href=""#r283"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r283"">2017</a>; Toker, Mancarci, Tripathy, &amp; Pavlidis, <a href=""#r339"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r339"">2018</a>; Trépanier, Hopperton, Mizrahi, Mechawar, &amp; Bazinet, <a href=""#r342"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r342"">2016</a>; van Kesteren et al., <a href=""#r356"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r356"">2017</a>). Microarray and RNA sequencing studies of the different brain regions have consistently shown upregulated or dysregulated expression of genes in pathways related to immune response and to inflammation within schizophrenia (Bergon et al., <a href=""#r22"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r22"">2015</a>; Chang et al., <a href=""#r50"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r50"">2017</a>; Fillman et al., <a href=""#r104"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r104"">2013</a>; Gamazon, Zwinderman, Cox, Denys, &amp; Derks, <a href=""#r115"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r115"">2019</a>; Gandal, Zhang, et al., <a href=""#r117"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r117"">2018</a>; Hess et al., <a href=""#r147"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r147"">2016</a>; Hwang et al., <a href=""#r157"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r157"">2013</a>; Kim, Hwang, Lee, &amp; Webster, <a href=""#r184"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r184"">2016</a>; Lanz et al., <a href=""#r197"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r197"">2019</a>; Lindholm Carlström et al., <a href=""#r201"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r201"">2021</a>; Mistry, Gillis, &amp; Pavlidis, <a href=""#r233"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r233"">2013</a>). Neuropathologic studies have shown a downregulation of microglia-related transcripts in schizophrenia, which coincides with the upregulation of sequences associated with inflammation (Gandal, Haney et al., <a href=""#r116"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r116"">2018</a>; Snijders et al., <a href=""#r321"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r321"">2021</a>). It appears that in patients with schizophrenia, microglia could remain in a dormant state, inactive with respect to preserving cerebral homeostasis (Murphy &amp; Weickert, <a href=""#r243"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r243"">2021</a>).</p>"
"<p>The consistent upregulation of immune indicators observed in schizophrenia suggests a potential involvement of viral infection and the BBB in both the etiology and neuropathology of this disorder (Webster, <a href=""#r370"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r370"">2023</a>). These dysregulated immune-related markers varied from study to study, although the following subset of genes is frequently upregulated. SERPINA3, a serpin peptidase inhibitor, is triggered by cytokines and possesses anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties (Sánchez-Navarro, González-Soria, Caldiño-Bohn, &amp; Bobadilla, <a href=""#r299"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r299"">2021</a>). Its upregulation in astrocytes at the BBB suggests that the astrocytes may be mounted against the infectious agent as a counteracting defensive mechanism, leading to an increase in interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) proteins within the endothelial cells (Murphy et al., <a href=""#r242"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r242"">2020</a>). IFITM proteins are recognized for their role in defending various viruses, inhibiting viral cytosolic access, and thereby impeding an initial stage of viral replication (Ren et al., <a href=""#r287"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r287"">2020</a>). GBP2 protects against viral infection in the innate immune system (Braun et al., <a href=""#r34"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r34"">2019</a>). CD163, a cysteine-rich scavenger receptor of macrophages, has multiple functions as an innate immune sensor and as an inducer of local inflammation (Etzerodt &amp; Moestrup, <a href=""#r94"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r94"">2013</a>). Interestingly, after intracerebral hemorrhage, CD163 mediates the internalization into macrophages of haptoglobin-hemoglobin complexes, which is essential for the clearance of hemoglobin from erythrocytes lysis (Garton, Keep, Hua, &amp; Xi, <a href=""#r120"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r120"">2017</a>). <a href=""#tab1"" class=""usa-link"">Table 1</a> shows the major immune-related dysregulated markers in schizophrenia.</p>"

In schizophrenia, changes in peripheral cytokine may affect the brain through multiple mechanisms (Khandaker &amp; Dantzer, <a href=""#r180"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r180"">2016</a>). Certain cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-1β, IL-8, IL-18, and TNF-α, are humoral host defense factors produced in response to infection or to tissue injury and stimulate the acute phase response, hematopoiesis, and immune processes (e.g., inflammation and interferon-γ production) (Bernhard et al., <a href=""#r23"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r23"">2021</a>; Ren &amp; Torres, <a href=""#r286"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r286"">2009</a>; Tanaka, Narazaki, &amp; Kishimoto, <a href=""#r335"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r335"">2014</a>; Zhang &amp; An, <a href=""#r393"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r393"">2007</a>). The genes responsible for these factors manifest expression in astrocytes, perivascular macrophages, and vascular endothelial cells, suggesting BBB involvement and a possible aberrant interplay with the peripheral immune system in schizophrenia (Cai et al., <a href=""#r43"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r43"">2020</a>; Hwang et al., <a href=""#r157"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r157"">2013</a>; Kim, Hwang, Lee, et al., <a href=""#r184"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r184"">2016</a>; Murphy et al., <a href=""#r242"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r242"">2020</a>; Purves-Tyson et al., <a href=""#r281"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r281"">2021</a>; Siegel, Sengupta, Edelson, Lewis, &amp; Volk, <a href=""#r319"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r319"">2014</a>; Volk et al., <a href=""#r361"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r361"">2015</a>). Murphy &amp; Weickert (<a href=""#r243"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r243"">2021</a>) postulated that the microglia do not mount a typical inflammatory response, suggesting that the immune response may be persistent and even due to previous exposure so that microglia would be depleted. <a href=""#tab2"" class=""usa-link"">Table 2</a> shows cytokine alterations observed in schizophrenia.</p>"

"<p>Without any doubt, one of the most revealing neuropathologic findings within the pathophysiology of schizophrenia is the deficit of GABAergic interneurons (Dienel &amp; Lewis, <a href=""#r84"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r84"">2019</a>). Inverse correlations between elevated cytokine levels and higher IFITM mRNA levels, as well as GABAergic neuron markers in the frontal cortex, have been reported by several authors (Fillman et al., <a href=""#r104"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r104"">2013</a>; Siegel et al., <a href=""#r319"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r319"">2014</a>). Moreover, in the hippocampal region, the gene expression modules associated with immunity and inflammation also exhibit an inverse correlation with GABAergic indicators (Hwang et al., <a href=""#r157"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r157"">2013</a>; Kim, Hwang, Webster, &amp; Lee, <a href=""#r185"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r185"">2016</a>). Several upregulated genes are linked to the response to viral infection, which suggests that the immune response induced by these pathogenic microorganisms is not exclusively related to schizophrenia, but also to a decrease in GABAergic interneurons (Kim, Hwang, Webster, et al., <a href=""#r185"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r185"">2016</a>). In animal models, the maternal immune activation in utero by poly(I:C) or LPS inoculation results in increased cytokine concentrations inside the fetal cerebrum (Meyer et al., <a href=""#r225"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r225"">2006</a>), which could persist postnatally (Garay, Hsiao, Patterson, &amp; McAllister, <a href=""#r118"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r118"">2013</a>; Purves-Tyson et al., <a href=""#r281"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r281"">2021</a>), affecting the neural circuit development process (Meyer, Nyffeler, Yee, Knuesel, &amp; Feldon, <a href=""#r226"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r226"">2008</a>; Richetto, Calabrese, Riva, &amp; Meyer, <a href=""#r289"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r289"">2014</a>; Warm, Schroer, &amp; Sinning, <a href=""#r368"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r368"">2022</a>). Other upregulated genes in schizophrenia include midbrain immune-related transcripts that may contribute to the dopaminergic abnormalities observed in the disease (Purves-Tyson et al., <a href=""#r281"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r281"">2021</a>). The top genome-wide association studies implicating gene complement components, such as C4, C3, and C1qA, are also frequently identified as being upregulated in the brains of individuals with schizophrenia (Gamazon et al., <a href=""#r115"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r115"">2019</a>; Gandal, Zhang, et al., <a href=""#r117"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r117"">2018</a>; Lindholm Carlström et al., <a href=""#r201"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r201"">2021</a>; Wang, Liu, et al., <a href=""#r365"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r365"">2018</a>). The correlation between the HLA area and schizophrenia is reinforced by the complement component C4 gene, which actively participates in synaptic trimming throughout postnatal growth (Sekar et al., <a href=""#r308"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r308"">2016</a>).</p>"
"<p>In summary, according to Webster (<a href=""#r370"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r370"">2023</a>), the pleiotropic effects of dysregulated immune molecules, which also contribute to various crucial processes such as cerebral development, neural plasticity, and homeostasis, may play an important role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia compared to immune activation by microbial infection. Nevertheless, infection occurring during vulnerable periods of development in genetically predisposed subjects could indefinitely disrupt the typical expression of these pleiotropic immune molecules, thus increasing susceptibility to successive stress on brain development and function (Borrego-Ruiz &amp; Borrego, <a href=""#r31"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r31"">2024b</a>).</p>"
"<p>Schizophrenia and other psychiatric conditions may eventually be activated by different viral infections, but the precise mechanisms are yet unknown. Maternal viral infections occurring in the first stages of gestation may potentially contribute to the onset of psychiatric conditions in the progeny during later developmental stages (Kotsiri et al., <a href=""#r190"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r190"">2023</a>). We comprehensively review the literature addressing the role of several neurotropic viruses, such as herpesviruses, influenza virus, Borna disease virus, and coronaviruses, on the onset of schizophrenia.</p>"
"<p>Herpesviruses consist of double-stranded DNA viruses (family <em>Herpesviridae</em>) that cause persistent latent infections, which can periodically reactivate and lead to disease in susceptible populations (Croen, <a href=""#r62"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r62"">1991</a>). The herpesviruses that are able to infect humans are divided into three groups on the basis of their genetic and antigenic characteristics: the alpha group includes herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1, or human herpesvirus 1, HHV-1), herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2, or HHV-2), and varicella-zoster virus (VZV, or HHV-3); the beta group comprises cytomegalovirus (CMV or HHV-5), human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6), and human herpesvirus 7 (HHV-7); and the gamma group consists of Epstein–Barr virus (EBV or HHV-4), and Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (HHV-8) (Gatherer et al., <a href=""#r122"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r122"">2021</a>). Among them, HSV-1, CMV, and EBV have been recognized for inducing moderate symptoms in adults, but for provoking more severe disease manifestations in neonates or immunosuppressed subjects. In such vulnerable people, immune deficiency leads to a loss of viral replication regulation, resulting in tissue harm and, in more extreme instances, terminal organ pathology and mortality (Griffiths &amp; Reeves, <a href=""#r131"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r131"">2021</a>; Griffiths, Baraniak, &amp; Reeves, <a href=""#r132"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r132"">2015</a>).</p>"
"<p>Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a common infection that is spread primarily through skin-to-skin contact and can cause painful blisters or ulcers (Kriebs, <a href=""#r191"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r191"">2008</a>). Its prevalence remains within populations, escalating with age, reaching 90% or higher in certain geographic areas (Prasad et al., <a href=""#r276"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r276"">2012</a>). There are two types of HSV: HSV-1 spreads primarily through oral contact and causes infections inside or around the mouth (oral herpes), but it can also cause genital herpes. Type 2 (HSV-2) is spread through sexual contact and provokes genital herpes.</p>"
"<p>HSV-1 often induces primary infections in human mucosal epithelial cells (Ryder, Jin, McNulty, Grulich, &amp; Donovan, <a href=""#r294"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r294"">2009</a>), while severe corneal keratitis and encephalitis are less common (Harkness, Kader, &amp; DeLuca, <a href=""#r142"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r142"">2014</a>; James &amp; Kimberlin, <a href=""#r163"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r163"">2015</a>; Marcocci et al., <a href=""#r212"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r212"">2020</a>; Steiner, Kennedy, &amp; Pachner, <a href=""#r325"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r325"">2007</a>). After initial mucosal infections, which may be asymptomatic, viral particles enter sensory neurons through nerve terminals and travel retrogradely along axons, establishing a latent state in neuronal cell bodies that can persist for the entire lifetime of the host (Harkness et al., <a href=""#r142"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r142"">2014</a>; Nicoll, Proença, &amp; Efstathiou, <a href=""#r253"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r253"">2012</a>; Steiner et al., <a href=""#r325"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r325"">2007</a>). The viral DNA may endure within the neuronal cell body in an episomal state, indicating its independence from integration into the host cell chromosome, instead remaining suspended within the cytoplasm (St Leger, Koelle, Kinchington, &amp; Verjans, <a href=""#r326"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r326"">2021</a>). The state of latency is maintained through a complex interplay of host and viral factors, with the virus potentially reactivating later in life via sensory nerves, returning to its initial entry site (Shimomura &amp; Higaki, <a href=""#r315"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r315"">2011</a>). Triggers recognized to initiate reactivation comprise aging, stress, immunosuppression, and co-infection with other viruses (Yan et al., <a href=""#r382"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r382"">2020</a>). HSV-1 reactivation rarely causes encephalitis, but mutations in toll-like receptors and neuronal immunity increase the risk (Lafaille et al., <a href=""#r195"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r195"">2019</a>). Newborns of mothers with HSV-1 genital infections may develop encephalitis or multi-organ infections (James &amp; Kimberlin, <a href=""#r163"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r163"">2015</a>). In the cerebrum, however, HSV-1 typically results in a persistent infection regulated by the CNS immune system (Marcocci et al., <a href=""#r212"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r212"">2020</a>).</p>"
"<p>Initial analyses indicated an increased prevalence of seropositivity for antibodies directed against HSV-2, cytomegalovirus, and <em>T. gondii</em> in subjects with diagnosed cognitive decline (Nimgaonkar et al., <a href=""#r254"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r254"">2016</a>). There is a long history of research linking HSV-1 to mental disorders (Dickerson et al., <a href=""#r76"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r76"">2003</a>; Kotsiri et al., <a href=""#r190"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r190"">2023</a>; Prasad et al., <a href=""#r276"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r276"">2012</a>; Yolken, <a href=""#r385"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r385"">2004</a>), but several studies have not found heightened HSV-1 serum antibodies from subjects with schizophrenia (Aiello et al., <a href=""#r5"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r5"">2006</a>; Katan et al., <a href=""#r174"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r174"">2013</a>), and a current meta-analysis suggested a divergence between cases and controls, showing a small to medium effect size (Dickerson, Schroeder, Nimgaonkar, Gold, &amp; Yolken, <a href=""#r82"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r82"">2020</a>). Additional supportive evidence includes brain imaging studies showing diminished gray matter volume in HSV-1 seropositive subjects (Prasad et al., <a href=""#r275"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r275"">2011</a>; Schretlen et al., <a href=""#r307"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r307"">2010</a>), and enhancement in the cognitive function of HSV-1 seropositive individuals with schizophrenia who underwent extended courses of high-dose antiviral treatment (Bhatia et al., <a href=""#r24"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r24"">2018</a>; Prasad et al., <a href=""#r277"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r277"">2013</a>).

"<p>While the evidence for HSV-1 infection in schizophrenia versus control populations is inconclusive (de Witte et al., <a href=""#r75"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r75"">2015</a>), there is compelling data suggesting that HSV-1 infection may play a role in cognitive decline in the context of schizophrenia. Two recent systematic reviews and a meta-analysis have indicated that HSV-1 negatively impacts the neurocognitive function of schizophrenic subjects, with small to moderate effect sizes (Tucker &amp; Bertke, <a href=""#r347"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r347"">2019</a>; Dickerson et al., <a href=""#r82"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r82"">2020</a>).</p>"
"<p>Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) belongs to the family <em>Orthoherpesviridae</em> (<em>Betaherpesvirinae</em> subfamily). Failure to achieve complete viral clearance after primary infection results in long-lasting infection marked by intervals of latency and reactivation in approximately 80% of the general population worldwide, with significant differences by age, sex, and geographic area (Goodrum, <a href=""#r126"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r126"">2016</a>; Zuhair et al., <a href=""#r398"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r398"">2019</a>). Primary infection with CMV frequently takes place during childhood via exposure to oral or genital secretions (Petersen, Patel, Abraham, Quinn, &amp; Tobian, <a href=""#r268"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r268"">2021</a>).</p>"
"<p>Primary infections in immunocompetent subjects may be subclinic or generate nonspecific symptoms like a slight fever or a mononucleosis syndrome, because CMV harbors a large number of genes that encode for evasion of the host’s innate and adaptive immune mechanisms, such as attenuation of type I interferon (IFN-I) production, downregulation of the activity of natural killer cell, inhibition of MHC class I and II antigen presentation, and interference with the proliferation of T cells (Griffiths &amp; Reeves, <a href=""#r131"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r131"">2021</a>; Mishra, Kumar, Ingle, &amp; Kumar, <a href=""#r231"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r231"">2020</a>; Patro, <a href=""#r263"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r263"">2019</a>; Ye et al., <a href=""#r384"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r384"">2020</a>). This virus-host interaction can modify host immunity gradually, as a significant proportion of the immune system is directed against CMV antigens (Picarda &amp; Benedict, <a href=""#r269"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r269"">2018</a>), and frequent viral reactivation may detrimentally affect the immunity of the host to infections by other microorganisms (Furman et al., <a href=""#r112"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r112"">2015</a>; Martinez et al., <a href=""#r215"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r215"">2021</a>; Nicoli et al., <a href=""#r252"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r252"">2022</a>; Wall et al., <a href=""#r364"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r364"">2021</a>). Additional evidence suggests that CMV may protect against heterologous infections and enhance vaccine efficacy through sustained immune activation, with minimal impact in healthy populations (Furman et al., <a href=""#r112"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r112"">2015</a>; Forte, Zhang, Thorp, &amp; Hummel, <a href=""#r110"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r110"">2020</a>). However, repeated episodes of CMV reactivation can result in a decrease in T cells and an increase in CMV-specific T cells, especially effector memory cells (Ford et al., <a href=""#r109"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r109"">2020</a>), leading to disease or tissue damage in immunocompromised populations, and potentially in patients with psychiatric disorders (Griffiths &amp; Reeves, <a href=""#r131"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r131"">2021</a>; Savitz &amp; Yolken, <a href=""#r303"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r303"">2023</a>).</p>"
"<p>The conceptualization that CMV might be implicated in the development of schizophrenia began to develop in the 1970s, with the first investigations based on serological studies (Yolken &amp; Torrey, <a href=""#r387"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r387"">1995</a>). Later, other serological studies included socioeconomic and geographical variables, and also individuals experiencing the initial onset or the first episode of schizophrenia (Torrey et al., <a href=""#r340"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r340"">2006</a>). Furthermore, a cohort study revealed that symptomatic CMV infection of the CNS in early life conferred a higher risk of developing schizophrenia (Dalman et al., <a href=""#r65"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r65"">2008</a>). Besides, in patients with schizophrenia, higher CMV IgG titers correlated with reduced right hippocampal volume and diminished episodic verbal memory (Houenou et al., <a href=""#r155"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r155"">2014</a>). In contrast, several studies have reported lower cognitive function in CMV-seropositive schizophrenia patients (Dickerson et al., <a href=""#r79"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r79"">2014</a>; Shirts et al., <a href=""#r316"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r316"">2008</a>). More recently, Moya Lacasa et al. (<a href=""#r239"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r239"">2021</a>) did not find a significant difference in the prevalence of CMV seropositivity and scores in schizophrenia and other nonaffective psychotic disorders compared to healthy controls. Clinical heterogeneity and several confounding factors, including age, medication, as well as socioeconomic and habitat status, may potentially contribute to the conflicting results between studies (Bolu et al., <a href=""#r28"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r28"">2016</a>; Zheng &amp; Savitz, <a href=""#r395"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r395"">2023</a>). The detection of CMV nucleic acid in patients with schizophrenia using hybridization or polymerase chain reaction techniques has improved the sensitivity of viral detection in postmortem brain studies and strengthened the association between viral infection and schizophrenia (Cassedy, Parle-McDermott, &amp; O’Kennedy, <a href=""#r47"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r47"">2021</a>). Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that the likelihood of detecting CMV transcripts a priori is constrained due to the typically low levels of RNA/DNA associated with latent CMV infection (Shnayder et al., <a href=""#r317"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r317"">2018</a>), particularly considering that postmortem investigations frequently utilize aged and fixed brain tissue. Furthermore, the nondetection of genetic material of the virus in postmortem samples does not conclusively dismiss the potential for CMV to contribute to the pathology only in the initial phases of psychiatric disorders, or for CMV to exert pathological effects through immune activation without direct cerebral infection.</p>"
"<p>Brain-derived cells, such as BBB endothelial cells, vascular pericytes, myeloid lineage cells, astrocytes, glia, and neurons, have been shown to be completely permissive to CMV infection and replication (Alcendor, Charest, Zhu, Vigil, &amp; Knobel, <a href=""#r6"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r6"">2012</a>; Luo, Schwartz, &amp; Fortunato, <a href=""#r205"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r205"">2008</a>; Tsutsui, Kosugi, &amp; Kawasaki, <a href=""#r346"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r346"">2005</a>). Hence, it is plausible that CMV itself or the inflammation linked to repeated CMV reactivation can result in irregularities within cerebral morphology and function. A primary question is whether CMV can infect brain cells <em>in vivo</em> and induce the symptoms of psychosis, including schizophrenia. The BBB constitutes a protective barrier that plays a pivotal role in restricting the unconstrained movement of large molecules, like viral particles, from the blood stream into the CSF and the cells of the CNS. In this regard, several pathophysiological mechanisms may be involved. First, CMV particles in the circulation attain and infect brain microvascular endothelial cells, thereby gaining access to the CNS. In addition, CMV could potentially weaken the tight junctions of the BBB, predisposing the parenchyma to a pathogenesis driven by the immune system. Primary and latent CMV infections induce a systemic inflammatory response and the expression of chemokines and cytokines (e.g., MCP-1, and IFN-γ) (Hamilton, Scott, Naing, &amp; Rawlinson, <a href=""#r137"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r137"">2013</a>; Lurain et al., <a href=""#r206"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r206"">2013</a>; van de Berg et al., <a href=""#r353"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r353"">2010</a>), which can decrease the expression of tight junction protein and increase BBB permeability (Chai, She, Huang, &amp; Fu, <a href=""#r48"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r48"">2015</a>). Upon the entry of peripheral cytokines into the brain, the function of glial cells may be impaired, resulting in axonal demyelination and neural degeneration (Hammond, Marsh, &amp; Stevens, <a href=""#r140"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r140"">2019</a>; Mechawar &amp; Savitz, <a href=""#r219"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r219"">2016</a>; Wohleb, Franklin, Iwata, &amp; Duman, <a href=""#r376"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r376"">2016</a>). Furthermore, CMV could potentially compromise the host immune response and trigger host immunosuppression, thereby potentially facilitating the cellular senescence and the neuropathological changes that resemble the aging process (Naniche &amp; Oldstone, <a href=""#r248"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r248"">2000</a>; Salminen, <a href=""#r298"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r298"">2021</a>). Additionally, CMV can induce autoimmunity, and thus neuroinflammation, mediated by the autoimmune process (Halenius &amp; Hengel, <a href=""#r138"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r138"">2014</a>; Vanheusden et al., <a href=""#r354"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r354"">2017</a>).</p>"
"<p>Although a significant and strong relationship between CMV and schizophrenia may not be fully established, CMV infection may implicate a greater risk of negatively impacting cognitive function in the context of schizophrenia.</p>"
"<p>The gamma herpesvirus EBV is usually transmitted orally during childhood or adolescence, and the primary infection occurs in epithelial cells and is followed by infection of B lymphocytes (Vetsika &amp; Callan, <a href=""#r360"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r360"">2004</a>). Primary infection in infants and children is associated with nonspecific respiratory symptoms, whereas infection in adolescents and young adults manifests the symptoms of infectious mononucleosis, such as fever, adenopathy, and pharyngitis (Leung, Lam, &amp; Barankin, <a href=""#r198"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r198"">2024</a>). It seems that different age-dependent symptomatology may be related to hormonal changes that occur during puberty (Rostgaard et al., <a href=""#r292"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r292"">2019</a>). After the resolution of the acute infection, the virus can establish lifelong latency in B lymphocytes and epithelial cells, with subsequent reactivation episodes during life (Kempkes &amp; Robertson, <a href=""#r176"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r176"">2015</a>). Long-term EBV infection has been associated with neoplastic diseases, including B-cell lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and gastric cancer (Dugan, Coleman, &amp; Haverkos, <a href=""#r87"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r87"">2019</a>). In addition, this infection leads to alterations in the host immune system and is also related to several autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and systemic sclerosis (Bjornevik et al., <a href=""#r25"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r25"">2022</a>; Houen &amp; Trier, <a href=""#r154"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r154"">2021</a>). Acute infection is characterized by the production of early antigen (EA), antibodies (IgM and IgG) to viral capsid antigen (VCA), antibodies to EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA), and heterophilic antibodies (De Paschale &amp; Clerici, <a href=""#r71"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r71"">2012</a>).</p>"
"<p>An increased incidence of psychotic experiences in adolescents who were infected with EBV during childhood supports the potential relationship between EBV infection and schizophrenia (Khandaker, Stochl, Zammit, Lewis, &amp; Jones, <a href=""#r182"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r182"">2014b</a>). Individuals with schizophrenia had an aberrant response to EBV infection, characterized by increased levels of reactivity to EBV-VCA, but not to EBNA and total viral antigens. When combined with genetic risks for schizophrenia, individuals with the aberrant response to EBV were more likely to be diagnosed with schizophrenia than individuals without these risk factors (Dickerson et al., <a href=""#r81"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r81"">2019</a>). Moreover, schizophrenic patients with elevated levels of EBV antibodies presented lower levels of social cognition (Dickerson et al., <a href=""#r83"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r83"">2021</a>).</p>"
"<p>In essence, EBV has been linked to schizophrenia on the basis of psychotic experiences in adolescence among individuals with a history of EBV infection in childhood, as well as the higher likelihood of schizophrenia diagnosis in those with an aberrant response to EBV.</p>"
"<p>The influenza virus, belonging to the family <em>Orthomyxoviridae</em>, represents an enveloped virus with segmented negative-sense single-stranded RNA segments and includes three genera: influenza A, B, and C (Payne, <a href=""#r265"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r265"">2023</a>), of which influenza A is responsible for pandemics (Kępińska et al., <a href=""#r179"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r179"">2020</a>) and has been historically associated with schizophrenia and psychotic symptoms. Influenza A viruses are categorized into subtypes on the basis of the antigenic properties of hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). Specifically, the avian-derived strains and H5N1 virus are neurotropic, whereas H1N1 is non-neurotropic (Jang et al., <a href=""#r164"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r164"">2009</a>; Sadasivan, Zanin, O’Brien, Schultz-Cherry, &amp; Smeyne, <a href=""#r295"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r295"">2015</a>). While maternal infection with microorganisms has been reported as a risk for schizophrenia (Brown &amp; Patterson, <a href=""#r41"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r41"">2011</a>), there is no clear evidence for transplacental transmission of influenza virus into the offspring brain (Egorova, Egorov, &amp; Zabrodskaya, <a href=""#r90"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r90"">2024</a>; Lieberman, Bagdasarian, Thomas, &amp; Van De Ven, <a href=""#r199"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r199"">2011</a>; Shi, Tu, &amp; Patterson, <a href=""#r314"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r314"">2005</a>), so more relevant are the effects of infection-induced maternal immune activation on the developing brain (Egorova et al., <a href=""#r90"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r90"">2024</a>; Brown &amp; Meyer, <a href=""#r40"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r40"">2018</a>).</p>"
"<p>In animal models, maternal H1N1 infection provokes abnormalities in offspring at several levels: (i) gene expression; (ii) protein expression; (iii) brain structure; (iv) behavior; (v) neurotransmitter levels; and (vi) placental development. In humans, there is evidence that early maternal immune activation during pregnancy affects neonatal brain development and behavior (Lieberman et al., <a href=""#r199"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r199"">2011</a>). High maternal IL-6 and cortisol levels predicted larger neonatal amygdala volume and connectivity, as well as higher internalizing behavior, which in turn predicted poorer impulse control in the early years of life (Graham et al., <a href=""#r127"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r127"">2018</a>; <a href=""#r128"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r128"">2019</a>).</p>"
"<p>Fatemi et al. (<a href=""#r100"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r100"">2012</a>) reported that brain gene expression was altered in offspring infected at multiple embryonic times. In the first week, prenatal infection-induced gene expression changes associated with hypoxia, inflammation, and schizophrenia in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of exposed offspring. At 16 days, prenatal H1N1 infection was associated with gene changes related to myelination in the cerebellum and hippocampus, such as <em>mag, plp1, mal, mbp, mobp, mog, ncam1</em>, and <em>rgs4.</em> Several of these genes are known to be involved in schizophrenia (Fatemi et al., <a href=""#r99"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r99"">2009</a>; Van Campen et al., <a href=""#r352"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r352"">2020</a>). At 3 weeks, microarray data showed a high number of dysregulated genes in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum of virus-exposed offspring, such as <em>Sema3a</em>, <em>Trfr2</em>, and <em>Vldlr</em>, which have also been implicated in schizophrenia (Fatemi et al., <a href=""#r98"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r98"">2008</a>). Further studies have shown that mice infected with influenza virus during pregnancy have lower hemagglutination inhibition and neutralizing antibody titers, because of a downregulation of B cell metabolism and post-translational modification systems (Swieboda et al., <a href=""#r329"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r329"">2020</a>).</p>"
"<p>Neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) produces nitric oxide (NO), a harmful molecule involved in fetal brain injury under hypoxia-ischemia conditions (Kneeland &amp; Fatemi, <a href=""#r188"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r188"">2013</a>). In the offspring of mice infected with H1N1 on day 9, nNOS was shown to increase by 147% on postnatal day 35, with a final decrease of 29% on postnatal day 56 in rostral brain areas. In addition, nNOS levels in the midbrain zones decreased by 27% at postnatal day 56 (Fatemi, Cuadra, El-Fakahany, Sidwell, &amp; Thuras, <a href=""#r96"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r96"">2000</a>). Upregulation of NO production has been suggested as a trigger for several human neurological disorders, including Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and schizophrenia (Iova et al., <a href=""#r159"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r159"">2023</a>). The suggested mechanisms for its neurotoxicity are mainly centered on the increased amounts of NO produced in the brain, which may lead to decoding of neuronal dysfunction associated with neuronal death. Moreover, the extracellular secretory glycoprotein reelin plays an important role during development and also in adulthood, such as maintaining synaptic function. Several neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, share a common feature of abnormal reelin expression in the brain (Kneeland &amp; Fatemi, <a href=""#r188"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r188"">2013</a>). In the brains of neonatal offspring of virus-exposed mice, reelin synthesis is reduced, reflecting abnormal neuronal migration and reduced synaptic plasticity. The mechanisms for abnormal reelin expression are currently unknown, although several mechanisms have been proposed, including mutations, hypermethylation of the gene promoter, miRNA silencing, FMRP underexpression, and abnormal processing (Folsom &amp; Fatemi, <a href=""#r106"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r106"">2013</a>).</p>"
"<p>Several brain abnormalities in mice have been associated with influenza virus infection, including increases in fractional anisotropy within the right middle cerebellar peduncle, pyramidal cell density, and brain volume, as well as decreases in area measurements within the cerebral cortex, unilateral brain hemispheres, and hippocampal region (Fatemi et al., <a href=""#r97"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r97"">2002</a>; Kneeland &amp; Fatemi, <a href=""#r188"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r188"">2013</a>). In rhesus monkeys, maternal inflammatory responses to influenza infection reduced gray matter throughout most of the cortex, and decreased white matter in the parietal cortex of the fetal brain (Short et al., <a href=""#r318"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r318"">2010</a>).</p>"
"<p>Behavioral abnormalities, such as the acoustic startle response and head twitch response, have also been observed in the offspring of virus-exposed mice (Moreno et al., <a href=""#r236"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r236"">2011</a>; Shi et al., <a href=""#r313"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r313"">2003</a>), signs typically induced by 5-HT2A agonists. In fact, the animals had increased 5-HT2A receptor expression in the frontal cortex and reduced levels of serotonin in the cerebellum (Moreno et al., <a href=""#r236"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r236"">2011</a>). In addition, several authors have reported neurotransmitter abnormalities in the offspring of virus-exposed mice, such as altered levels of taurine, serotonin, and GABA in the cerebellar region, but not in dopamine (Fatemi et al., <a href=""#r98"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r98"">2008</a>; <a href=""#r101"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r101"">2017</a>; Winter et al., <a href=""#r374"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r374"">2008</a>). Recently, Perez-Palomar, Erdozain, Erkizia-Santamaría, Ortega, &amp; Meana (<a href=""#r267"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r267"">2023</a>) reported that prenatal viral infection in mice was mimicked by poly(I:C) administration, which resulted in decreased extracellular dopamine concentrations compared to controls, concluding that the poly(I:C)-based model reproduces catecholamine phenotypes reported in schizophrenia.</p>"
"<p>Placental giant trophoblast cells are producers of hormones and cytokines that can influence maternal physiology in response to the fetal allograft (Elgueta, Murgas, Riquelme, Yang, &amp; Cancino, <a href=""#r91"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r91"">2022</a>). Infected placental tissue showed cytoarchitectural disorganization (Antonson et al., <a href=""#r8"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r8"">2021</a>; Van Campen et al., <a href=""#r352"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r352"">2020</a>) and an increased presence of immune cells (Fatemi et al., <a href=""#r100"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r100"">2012</a>). High levels of gene dysregulation have also been observed in the placenta of pregnant mice with influenza virus infection (Fatemi et al., <a href=""#r100"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r100"">2012</a>; Van Campen et al., <a href=""#r352"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r352"">2020</a>); these dysregulated placental genes significantly influence apoptosis, hypoxia, inflammation, immune response, and psychiatric disorders.</p>"
"<p>Both neurotropic and non-neurotropic strains of the influenza virus can induce microglial activation and contribute to inflammation (Sadasivan, Zanin, O’Brien, Schultz-Cherry, &amp; Smeyne, <a href=""#r295"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r295"">2015</a>; Wang et al., <a href=""#r366"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r366"">2008</a>). The innate immune response to influenza infection is mediated by antiviral IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) (Schoggins, <a href=""#r306"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r306"">2019</a>), including MXA (prevents virus nuclear import), IFITM3 (blocks host-virus cell membrane fusion), and viperin (blocks influenza virus release) (Iwasaki &amp; Pillai, <a href=""#r161"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r161"">2014</a>). In addition, innate immune mechanisms also promote disease resistance of host tissues, and prepare the microglia to respond appropriately to a novel stimulus (Kępińska et al., <a href=""#r179"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r179"">2020</a>). Furthermore, influenza virus infection may prime microglia for increased activation, potentially increasing the risk of developing psychotic symptoms (Salam, Borsini, &amp; Zunszain, <a href=""#r297"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r297"">2018</a>). Moreover, Littauer et al. (<a href=""#r202"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r202"">2017</a>) found that influenza virus infection resulted in dysregulation of inflammatory responses and the immune responses significantly correlated with changes in hormone synthesis and regulation. Dysregulation of progesterone, COX-2, PGE2, and PGF2α expression was accompanied by remodeling of placental architecture and upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase-9, an indicator of placental spongiotrophoblast degradation, early after infection.</p>"
"<p>Thus, converging evidence suggests that influenza virus infection possesses a variety of effects on prenatal and postnatal processes that could lead to an increased risk of developing schizophrenia or acute psychosis in adulthood.</p>"
"<p>Borna disease virus (BoDV) is a negative-sense, single-stranded RNA virus of the <em>Bornaviridae</em> family whose specific hosts are horses, sheep, poultry, and cattle (Rubbenstroth et al., <a href=""#r293"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r293"">2021</a>). Several properties of BoDV make it a potential agent of human psychiatric disorders, such as: (i) it infects neurons; (ii) it has a broad host range; (iii) it presents a high tropism for the limbic circuit, which regulates behavior, memory, and emotion, and appears to play a key role in the etiopathology of several human psychiatric disorders; and (iv) experimental BoDV infection in animals can result in various symptoms related to aggression, hyperactivity, apathy, or motor symptoms that resemble core features of human psychiatric disorders, such as depression or schizophrenia (Briese, Hornig, &amp; Lipkin, <a href=""#r36"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r36"">1999</a>). In addition, a neuronal route of BoDV transmission has been demonstrated in animals, involving the olfactory nerve in the nasal mucosa (Kupke et al., <a href=""#r194"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r194"">2019</a>).</p>"
"<p>As a neurotropic virus, BoDV infects the CNS of animals, causing neuronal degeneration and neurological disorders such as encephalitis, meningitis, various neurodevelopmental movement disorders, and behavioral disorders with schizophrenia-like manifestations (Taieb, Baleyte, Mazet, &amp; Fillet, <a href=""#r333"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r333"">2001</a>). For example, Ovanesov et al. (<a href=""#r260"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r260"">2008</a>) reported that neonatal BoDV infection of the rat brain was associated with microglial activation and neuronal damage. Stimulated microglia expressed MHC I, MHC II, and IL-6, showing increased secretion of TNF-α and of IL-1, which have been suggested as potential molecular biomarkers for the development of schizophrenia.</p>"
"<p>Several works have studied whether BoDV disease can directly cause schizophrenic disorders in humans (Arias et al., <a href=""#r11"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r11"">2012</a>; Azami, Jalilian, Khorshidi, Mohammadi, &amp; Tardeh, <a href=""#r15"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r15"">2018</a>; Chen et al., <a href=""#r52"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r52"">1999</a>; Mazaheri-Tehrani et al., <a href=""#r216"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r216"">2014</a>; Sansom, <a href=""#r301"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r301"">2000</a>), or other mental conditions, such as mood-related disorders and depression (Hornig et al., <a href=""#r153"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r153"">2012</a>; Kim et al., <a href=""#r186"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r186"">2003</a>; Selten et al., <a href=""#r309"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r309"">2000</a>). In contrast, Iwata et al. (<a href=""#r162"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r162"">1998</a>) measured BoDV p24 RNA in peripheral blood monocytes from psychiatric patients, and they did not find a relationship between virus infection and mood or schizophrenia. Similar results were reported in several countries, where BoDV infection and pathogenesis of schizophrenia were not found (Hornig et al., <a href=""#r153"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r153"">2012</a>; Miranda et al., <a href=""#r230"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r230"">2006</a>; Selten et al., <a href=""#r309"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r309"">2000</a>; Soltani, Mohammadzadeh, Makvandi, Pakseresht, &amp; Samarbaf-Zadeh, <a href=""#r322"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r322"">2016</a>).</p>"
"<p>In summary, the inconsistency in the results may be due to different geographic and genetic factors such as HLA, which was included in different studies (Na, Tae, Song, &amp; Kim, <a href=""#r245"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r245"">2009</a>), as well as to the different techniques used for virus detection (Wolff, Heins, Pauli, Burger, &amp; Kurth, <a href=""#r377"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r377"">2006</a>).</p>"

<em>Coronaviridae</em> is a family of enveloped, positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses described in the decade of the 1960s (Mahase, <a href=""#r209"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r209"">2020</a>). Human coronavirus (HCoVs) 229E, OC43, HKU1, and NL63 cause upper respiratory tract infections or the “common cold” in a typical winter season (Cui, Li, &amp; Shi, <a href=""#r64"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r64"">2019</a>; Su et al., <a href=""#r328"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r328"">2016</a>; Woo et al., <a href=""#r378"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r378"">2023</a>). Since the turn of the 21st century, three highly virulent coronavirus strains have emerged. SARS-CoV, in 2002–2003, was identified in Guangdong (China), and subsequently spread to 17 countries, causing over 8000 cases (de Wit, van Doremalen, Falzarano, &amp; Munster, <a href=""#r74"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r74"">2016</a>; Zhong et al., <a href=""#r396"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r396"">2003</a>). Later, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), caused by MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV), was reported between 2012 and 2017, primarily in Middle Eastern countries (Zaki, van Boheemen, Bestebroer, Osterhaus, &amp; Fouchier, <a href=""#r391"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r391"">2012</a>) and later in the Republic of Korea (de Wit et al., <a href=""#r74"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r74"">2016</a>); both MERS outbreaks caused a total of approximately 2500 cases. Bats and camels were suggested to be reservoirs for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively. The newest member of the HCoVs, known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic that affected more than 130 million people worldwide. While the zoonotic aspects of SARS-CoV-2 are still under investigation, bats also appear to be its animal reservoir (Ahmad et al., <a href=""#r3"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r3"">2020</a>; Cui et al., <a href=""#r64"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r64"">2019</a>).</p>"
"<p>A key feature of these virulent HCoVs is their ability to replicate in epithelial cells and pneumocytes in the human lower respiratory tract, causing pneumonia (Cui et al., <a href=""#r64"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r64"">2019</a>; de Wit et al., <a href=""#r74"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r74"">2016</a>) and, in severe cases, acute respiratory distress syndrome. However, SARS and MERS can infect the nervous system (Netland, Meyerholz, Moore, Cassell, &amp; Perlman, <a href=""#r251"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r251"">2008</a>), causing peripheral neuropathies, encephalopathies, motor deficits, paralysis, and coma (Arabi et al., <a href=""#r10"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r10"">2015</a>; Wu et al., <a href=""#r380"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r380"">2020</a>), as well as psychiatric manifestations such as depression, anxiety, mood alterations, mania, and psychosis (Rogers et al., <a href=""#r291"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r291"">2020</a>; Severance et al., <a href=""#r311"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r311"">2011</a>). Because the unique link between HCoVs infection and psychosis is inflammation, it is logical to think that COVID-19 infection, which induces a massive inflammatory response (Steardo, Steardo, Zorec, &amp; Verkhratsky, <a href=""#r324"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r324"">2020</a>), could produce more psychotic symptoms (Graham et al., <a href=""#r129"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r129"">2021</a>; Mazza et al., <a href=""#r217"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r217"">2021</a>; Taquet, Geddes, Husain, Luciano, &amp; Harrison, <a href=""#r337"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r337"">2021</a>).</p>"
"<p>SARS-CoV-2 has a similar neurotropism to SARS-CoV and enters into the CNS through the circulatory route (Baig, <a href=""#r16"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r16"">2020</a>) and via peripheral neurons, to reach the brain (Wu et al., <a href=""#r380"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r380"">2020</a>). Another pathway, the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone near the olfactory bulb, has also been suggested (Pourfridoni &amp; Askarpour, <a href=""#r274"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r274"">2022</a>). In addition, the isolation of SARS-CoV-2 from CSF may suggest a direct infection of the neurological system causing nerve damage (Rentero et al., <a href=""#r288"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r288"">2020</a>). The two SARS-CoV viruses share the same adsorption host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), extensively expressed in neurons and glial cells (Steardo et al., <a href=""#r324"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r324"">2020</a>), although the binding affinity for SARS-CoV-2 is 10 to 20 times higher than that of SARS-CoV (Hoffmann et al., <a href=""#r151"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r151"">2020</a>; Wrapp et al., <a href=""#r379"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r379"">2020</a>). Binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 and subsequent viral endocytosis dysregulate the angiotensin system, leading to the loss of ACE2-mediated health protection and adverse systemic effects by releasing TNF-α, IL-6, and other cytokine mediators, which lead to the cytokine storm in COVID-19 (Davies, Adlimoghaddam, &amp; Albensi, <a href=""#r66"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r66"">2021</a>; Gheblawi et al., <a href=""#r123"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r123"">2020</a>).</p>"
"<p>A number of pathways associated with COVID-19 overlap with those that may be involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, including cellular response to dopamine, IL-1 signaling, T helper cell differentiation, and immunological synapse formation (Moni, Lin, Quinn, &amp; Eapen, <a href=""#r234"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r234"">2021</a>). In both schizophrenia and COVID-19, as a consequence of the inflammatory process, there is an increase in levels of kynurenic acid, which acts as an anti-excitotoxic factor (Collier, Zhang, Scrutton, &amp; Giorgini, <a href=""#r59"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r59"">2021</a>). In addition, COVID-19 may induce psychosis through the development of the anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor encephalitis, according to the theory of molecular mimicry of the SARS-CoV-2 (Payus et al., <a href=""#r266"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r266"">2022</a>; Vasilevska et al., <a href=""#r359"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r359"">2021</a>), and increase the activity of the midbrain dopamine neurons (Erhardt, Schwieler, Nilsson, Linderholm, &amp; Engberg, <a href=""#r93"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r93"">2007</a>). Interestingly, activation of monocytes by toll-like receptor 3 (TLR-3) and depletion of natural killer cells associated with an early antiviral response has been shown to occur in both schizophrenia and anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis (Karpiński, Samochowiec, Frydecka, Sąsiadek, &amp; Misiak, <a href=""#r172"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r172"">2018</a>; Müller &amp; Schwarz, <a href=""#r240"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r240"">2010</a>; Müller et al., <a href=""#r241"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r241"">2012</a>). In COVID-19, the TLR-3 pathway is linked to a tissue-destructive senescence-associated secretory phenotype that is related to short- and long-term complications (Tripathi et al., <a href=""#r343"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r343"">2021</a>).</p>"
"<p>C-reactive protein (CRP) has been studied as a potential peripheral measure of immunologic activation that may have a causal or precipitating function in schizophreniform psychosis (Fond, Lançon, Auquier, &amp; Boyer, <a href=""#r107"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r107"">2018</a>). HCoVs possess neuroinvasive properties as a result of either autoimmune responses or viral replication, leading to the hypothesis that they cause neuroinflammation and CNS penetration in psychotic disorders (Ferrando et al., <a href=""#r103"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r103"">2020</a>). In fact, COVID-19 is involved in several inflammatory changes, including disruption of the Th1/Th2 and IL-2 balances, and alteration of Tregs (Aleebrahim-Dehkordi et al., <a href=""#r7"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r7"">2022</a>).</p>"
"<p>Although it has been suggested that an increased risk of schizophrenia in the offspring is associated with maternal infection in earlier trimesters (Brown et al., <a href=""#r42"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r42"">2000</a>), data on maternal and neonatal outcomes of COVID-19 infection are limited (Ashraf et al., <a href=""#r13"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r13"">2020</a>; Islam et al., <a href=""#r160"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r160"">2020</a>; Kulaga &amp; Miller, <a href=""#r192"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r192"">2021</a>). Because so little time has elapsed since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is too early to link cases of schizophrenia to SARS-CoV-2. This possibility is more likely for people who were exposed to this virus during the prenatal and perinatal periods, a similar dynamic that occurred in such a way after influenza epidemics when individuals developed schizophrenia due to exposure to the viral infection.</p>"
"<p>SARS and MERS lead to severe respiratory illnesses, and several studies have investigated the acute and post-illness neuropsychiatric outcomes of these diseases (Rogers et al., <a href=""#r291"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r291"">2020</a>). The mental health impact of the SARS outbreaks in 2002–2003 caused significant psychological distress and morbidities among patients, healthcare workers, and the general public in affected regions (Chau et al., <a href=""#r49"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r49"">2021</a>). The chronic psychiatric issues observed in SARS survivors underscore the potential long-term mental health complications that COVID-19 patients may face. Thus, in addition to the biological effects of COVID-19 that may increase the risk of schizophrenia, the COVID-19 pandemic may contribute to an increase in reactive psychotic disorders due to its stressful nature (Kulaga &amp; Miller, <a href=""#r192"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r192"">2021</a>; Valdés-Florido et al., <a href=""#r350"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r350"">2020</a>). This may be explained by the diathesis-stress hypothesis. In this theory, stressful experiences have always been considered one of the most important factors in the development and exacerbation of mental disorders, independently of the effects of nervous system infections. One of the longest-standing pathoetiological hypotheses for schizophrenia is the interaction between external stimuli and internal vulnerability (Pruessner, Cullen, Aas, &amp; Walker, <a href=""#r279"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r279"">2017</a>). According to this theory, psychosocial stress can cause the microglia to become pathologically activated, leading to excessive synaptic pruning and the loss of cortical gray matter. Therefore, damage to the stress-sensitive area may lead to immediate negative cognitive symptoms. Additionally, a loss of cortical control may prevent subcortical dopamine from acting, resulting in the positive symptoms of psychosis (Ma et al., <a href=""#r207"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r207"">2021</a>).</p>"
"<p>Within the context, neuropsychiatric adverse effects refer to brain-related symptoms developed during the treatment of pre-existing neurologic or psychiatric disorders, which range from mild symptoms, such as irritability and insomnia, to severe complications, including depression, psychosis, and painful peripheral neuropathy (Zareifopoulos, Lagadinou, Karela, Kyriakopoulou, &amp; Velissaris, <a href=""#r392"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r392"">2020</a>). However, it is very complex to distinguish whether these symptoms are due to the viral infection, to the immune response, or to the antiviral treatment.</p>"
"<p>In the case of the influenza virus, the most commonly used antivirals are neuraminidase inhibitors (such as oseltamivir or zanamivir), which prevent the viral spread and infection in the respiratory tract. However, a causal relationship between oseltamivir treatment and abnormal behavior has not yet been established, although the risk of abnormal behavior may be due to the viral infection, not to the antiviral drug (Ueda et al., <a href=""#r348"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r348"">2015</a>). Zanamivir treatment does not appear to cause neurological effects in humans. <a href=""#tab3"" class=""usa-link"">Table 3</a> shows the neuropsychiatric side effects and mechanisms of neurotoxicity of the major antiviral drugs.</p>"

"<p>Acyclovir and valacyclovir are the most commonly used antivirals for herpes infections. Their neuropsychiatric adverse effects include agitation, altered state of consciousness, confusion, dysarthria, and hallucinations (Brandariz-Nuñez, Correas-Sanahuja, Maya-Gallego, &amp; Martín Herranz, <a href=""#r33"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r33"">2021</a>). In the case of famciclovir, potential neurogenic adverse effects include ataxia, dementia, dysarthria, encephalopathy, and tremor (Fang, Zhou, Han, Chen, Guan, &amp; Li, <a href=""#r95"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r95"">2024</a>). The prevalence of nephrotoxic side effects ranged from 13% to 21%, while the prevalence of neurotoxicity was not clearly defined (Aboelezz &amp; Mahmoud, <a href=""#r1"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r1"">2024</a>). However, Brandariz-Nuñez et al. (<a href=""#r33"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r33"">2021</a>) reported that neurotoxicity associated with acyclovir and valaciclovir was 73.9% and 29.4%, respectively. Adverse effects related to famciclovir were more common in women (59.72%) than in men (34.49%) (Fang et al., <a href=""#r95"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r95"">2024</a>).</p>"
"<p>Acute psychosis was reported in individuals with AIDS and older adults with poor renal function treated with gancyclovir (Zareifopoulos et al., <a href=""#r392"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r392"">2020</a>). Several authors have reported that valacyclovir significantly improved verbal memory, working memory, and visual object learning, as well as schizophrenia symptoms (Bhatia et al., <a href=""#r24"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r24"">2018</a>; Deshpande &amp; Nimgaonkar, <a href=""#r73"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r73"">2018</a>; Prasad et al., <a href=""#r277"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r277"">2013</a>; Tsai et al., <a href=""#r344"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r344"">2020</a>). However, other authors did not find significant improvement with this antiviral on the psychotic symptoms and cognitive function measures (Breier et al., <a href=""#r35"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r35"">2019</a>; Jonker et al., <a href=""#r167"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r167"">2023</a>).</p>"
"<p>Antiviral drugs most used for the treatment of hepatitis B are nucleoside and nucleotide analogs (Kayaaslan &amp; Guner, <a href=""#r175"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r175"">2017</a>). Several of these drugs produce mitochondrial DNA depletion and have been associated with myopathy and peripheral neuropathy (Kamara et al., <a href=""#r169"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r169"">2016</a>). The combination of pegylated IFN and ribavirin was the treatment of choice for hepatitis C infection until the approval of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) that presented improved patient tolerability and lower side effects (Gutiérrez-Rojas et al., <a href=""#r136"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r136"">2023</a>; Sakamaki et al., <a href=""#r296"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r296"">2019</a>). Psychiatric disorders were a common adverse outcome during the treatment with the former drugs (Davoodi et al., <a href=""#r67"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r67"">2018</a>; Sakamaki et al., <a href=""#r296"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r296"">2019</a>). However, Cheng et al. (<a href=""#r54"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r54"">2021</a>) demonstrated that the hepatitis C-associated risk of schizophrenia could be reversed by interferon-based antiviral therapy.</p>"
"<p>Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) are nucleoside analogs lacking a 3-OH group, which are processed by the retroviral enzymes as unaltered nucleotides. The NRTIs incorporation into the newly synthesized viral DNA strand induces early termination of transcription, thereby inhibiting retroviral replication (Hirnschall, Harries, Easterbrook, Doherty, &amp; Ball, <a href=""#r148"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r148"">2013</a>). Efavirenz is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) also used to treat HIV infection, usually in combination with NRTIs, with its clinical use discussed due to multiple psychiatric side effects (Clifford et al., <a href=""#r58"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r58"">2005</a>; Kenedi &amp; Goforth, <a href=""#r178"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r178"">2011</a>). Several studies establish that efavirenz is a potent psychotropic drug with a higher affinity for GABA-A, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT2C receptors, while it also acts as a monoamine oxidase inhibitor and as a dual serotonin/dopamine reuptake inhibitor (Gatch et al., <a href=""#r121"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r121"">2013</a>). Nevirapine is another NNRTI that has rarely been associated with neuropsychiatric adverse effects (Wise, Mistry, &amp; Reid, <a href=""#r375"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r375"">2002</a>), although van Griensven et al. (<a href=""#r355"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r355"">2010</a>) reported its association with hepatotoxicity and peripheral neuropathy.</p>"
"<p>Protease inhibitors can also be used as part of active antiretroviral therapy. One of these, ritonavir, is an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and is synergistic with drugs that rely on CYP3A4 metabolism for inactivation. However, its use has been associated with a lipodystrophy syndrome characterized by insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, central obesity, and an increased risk of cerebrovascular disease (Duval et al., <a href=""#r88"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r88"">2004</a>; Gupta et al., <a href=""#r134"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r134"">2012</a>). Other HIV antivirals, such as raltegravir, elvitegravir, and dolutegravir, inhibit retroviral integrase, the enzyme that allows the integration of the viral DNA transcript into the host cell genome (Hoffmann &amp; Llibre, <a href=""#r149"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r149"">2019</a>). Side effects similar to those of efavirenz have been reported mainly for dolutegravir, but no evidence has been reported that provides insight into the mechanisms of integrase inhibitor-induced neuropsychiatric effects (Zareifopoulos et al., <a href=""#r392"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r392"">2020</a>). The most recently approved antiretrovirals are maraviroc and enfuvirtide, two agents included in the class of entry and fusion inhibitors, which are not considered first-line agents and are therefore used in combination with other antivirals. Clinical data indicate that maraviroc induces an increase in the CD4<sup>+</sup> count of patients (Llibre et al., <a href=""#r203"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r203"">2015</a>), but the side effects of these substances have not yet been established.</p>"
"<p>Schizophrenia appears to be the result of the influence of hereditary and environmental factors. Some environmental contributors include birth complications, maternal nutritional deficiencies, medication use, stress during pregnancy, and viral infections. Prenatal exposure to stressors, especially early in pregnancy, is critical for fetal hippocampal development, which influences an individual’s likelihood of developing a psychotic disorder (Brown &amp; Derkits, <a href=""#r39"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r39"">2010</a>) and schizophrenia (Brown, <a href=""#r37"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r37"">2011</a>; <a href=""#r38"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r38"">2012</a>). Epidemiological research has identified viral infection as one of the environmental risk factors for schizophrenia (Khandaker, Zimbron, Lewis, &amp; Jones, <a href=""#r181"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r181"">2013</a>). Some viral infections can disrupt normal fetal CNS development by activating the maternal immune system. Therefore, changes in the expression of key genes and increased levels of inflammatory cytokines are thought to be the connecting link between viral infection and schizophrenia (Huang, Zhang, &amp; Zhou, <a href=""#r156"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r156"">2022</a>). <a href=""#fig1"" class=""usa-link"">Figure 1</a> shows hypothetical interactions between viral infection and the development of schizophrenia (according to the Inflammatory Model and to Kępińska et al., <a href=""#r179"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r179"">2020</a>).</p>"

"<p>Inflammation seems to be associated with several processes, such as microbial infections, obesity, tobacco smoking, and autoimmune diseases. Macrophages play a pivotal role as the major cellular component of the adipose tissue regulating chronic inflammation and modulating the secretion and differentiation of various pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines (Savulescu-Fiedler et al., <a href=""#r304"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r304"">2024</a>). Elisia et al. (<a href=""#r92"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r92"">2020</a>) evaluated the effects of smoking on inflammatory markers, and they found that plasma samples from heavy smokers had significantly higher CRP, fibrinogen, IL-6, and carcinoembryonic antigen levels than non-smoking controls. A possible mechanism involving many pro-inflammatory cytokines has been proposed to explain the causal relationship between the virus and schizophrenia (<a href=""#fig1"" class=""usa-link"">Figure 1</a>). These modulators may act either directly on neurons or indirectly via neurotransmission, for example, through TNF-α (Xiu et al., <a href=""#r381"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r381"">2018</a>). Moreover, the TNF-α gene is located at a locus previously associated with genetic susceptibility to schizophrenia. Additionally, increased complement protein activity, particularly C1q, C3, and C4, was found to contribute to the accelerated synapse pruning (Presumey, Bialas, &amp; Carroll, <a href=""#r278"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r278"">2017</a>). These authors reported that the complement system stimulates synapse loss in the early stages of neurodegenerative diseases. Similar pathways can also be activated in response to inflammation, such as in West Nile virus infection, where peripheral inflammation can promote microglia-mediated synapse loss (Stonedahl, Clarke, &amp; Tyler, <a href=""#r327"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r327"">2020</a>).</p>"
"<p>In the present review, we have examined the influence of viral infections on schizophrenia, establishing that some of these are neurotropic and have the potential to provoke neurological disorders (Bauer et al., <a href=""#r18"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r18"">2022</a>; Capendale, Wolthers, &amp; Pajkrt, <a href=""#r45"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r45"">2023</a>; Ludlow et al., <a href=""#r204"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r204"">2016</a>; Marcocci et al., <a href=""#r212"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r212"">2020</a>; Meyding-Lamadé, Craemer, &amp; Schnitzler, <a href=""#r223"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r223"">2019</a>). In addition, some of these viruses induce latent infections in the host that can be reactivated by psychological stress (Cliffe et al., <a href=""#r57"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r57"">2015</a>; Griffiths &amp; Reeves, <a href=""#r131"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r131"">2021</a>; Klopack, <a href=""#r187"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r187"">2023</a>) or by an inflammatory response to the viral infection (Cuddy et al., <a href=""#r63"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r63"">2020</a>; Savitz &amp; Harrison, <a href=""#r302"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r302"">2018</a>), factors closely linked to the onset of several psychiatric disorders (Goldsmith &amp; Rapaport, <a href=""#r124"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r124"">2020</a>; Kendler &amp; Gardner, <a href=""#r177"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r177"">2016</a>; Pape, Tamouza, Leboyer, &amp; Zipp, <a href=""#r264"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r264"">2019</a>; Savitz &amp; Yolken, <a href=""#r303"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r303"">2023</a>). Furthermore, in this review, we have also explored the neuropsychiatric impact of antiviral drugs. Although several studies have established that antiviral therapy reduces the risk of schizophrenia (Breier et al., <a href=""#r35"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r35"">2019</a>; Jonker et al., <a href=""#r167"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r167"">2023</a>; Tsai et al., <a href=""#r344"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r344"">2020</a>), the negative effects of these antivirals have been poorly studied. On the basis of shared consequences of antivirals and schizophrenia, we can hypothesize that some antivirals provoke side effects compatible with schizophrenia symptoms, such as hallucinations, delusional beliefs, cognitive impairments, and psychosis, to name a few. Nevertheless, the studies reviewed present several significant limitations that must be considered when interpreting their findings. Many studies were observational or cross-sectional, which limits the capacity to establish causal relationships between viral infections, antiviral treatments, and neuropsychiatric outcomes, particularly in the context of schizophrenia. Small sample sizes were a common issue, undermining the statistical power of the studies and potentially leading to type II errors. Inconsistent reporting of variables, including variations in diagnostic criteria, medication types, and outcome measurement tools, introduced significant heterogeneity that reduced the robustness of the conclusions. Additionally, many studies did not adequately account for confounding factors such as genetic predispositions, comorbidities, or lifestyle factors like smoking, which could have influenced the results. Retrospective designs, reliance on clinical diagnoses rather than structured interviews, and incomplete or missing data (e.g., viral load, liver function tests, or genetic markers) further compromised the validity of the findings. Some studies also faced difficulties in standardizing methodologies, including the arbitrary selection of CRP cut-off values, the use of dichotomized data, and inconsistent cytokine panels. This lack of standardization, combined with publication and selection biases, limits the potential to generalize the results. Furthermore, the absence of long-term follow-up data and the failure to include diverse patient populations (e.g., regional biases) complicates the interpretation of the long-term effects of viral infections and antiviral treatments on schizophrenia. The limited focus on specific mental health diagnoses, as well as the under-recording of certain symptoms such as delirium in COVID-19 patients, may have also affected the outcomes. These methodological weaknesses point to the demand for well-designed, large-scale longitudinal studies with standardized protocols, better control of confounding factors, and more inclusive and diverse cohorts to clarify the complex relationships between viral infections, antiviral treatments, and neuropsychiatric conditions.</p>"
"<p>In addition to the key role of viral infections in the etiology of schizophrenia, it is essential to highlight the societal implications of this particular condition. Public perception often associates schizophrenia with aggressive tendencies, a belief reinforced by media coverage of violent incidents involving individuals identified as mentally ill (Wehring &amp; Carpenter, <a href=""#r371"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r371"">2011</a>). Studies indicate that schizophrenia is among the most stigmatized mental illnesses (de Jacq, Norful, &amp; Larson, <a href=""#r69"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r69"">2016</a>; Reisinger &amp; Gleaves, <a href=""#r284"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r284"">2023</a>; Mannarini, Taccini, Sato, &amp; Rossi, <a href=""#r210"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r210"">2022</a>; Valery &amp; Prouteau, <a href=""#r351"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r351"">2020</a>), fostering prevalent beliefs about dangerousness and incompetency that contribute to a poor prognosis and increased social distance, further isolating those affected and hindering access to support and resources (Valery &amp; Prouteau, <a href=""#r351"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r351"">2020</a>). Specifically, the perception of individuals with schizophrenia as dangerous influences the inclination for social distance, with beliefs about biogenetic causes and appropriate medical treatment also shaping these perceptions (Mannarini et al., <a href=""#r210"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r210"">2022</a>). Moreover, social exclusion is affected by the presence of negative symptoms and diagnosis awareness, where increased knowledge of the diagnosis leads to greater social distance when symptoms are absent, and decreased distance when symptoms are present (Zahid &amp; Best, <a href=""#r390"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r390"">2021</a>). Perceived discrimination and stigma consciousness negatively impact psychological well-being, diminishing self-esteem and social functioning, while disrupting daily activities and leading to heightened mental health adverse outcomes and reduced quality of life (Magallares, Perez-Garin, &amp; Molero, <a href=""#r208"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r208"">2016</a>; Lampropoulos, Fonte, &amp; Apostolidis, <a href=""#r196"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r196"">2019</a>). Furthermore, higher levels of self-stigma are observed in individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders compared to those with depressive disorders, despite similarities in overall quality of life, suggesting that the severity of the mental disorder significantly influences self-stigmatization (Holubová et al., <a href=""#r152"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r152"">2016</a>). In addition, bullying victimization has been identified as a major risk factor for the increased incidence of schizophrenia (Jester et al., <a href=""#r165"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r165"">2023</a>), suggesting that a key prevention strategy could involve studying the psychological experiences of victims, with particular focus on the impact of negative emotions such as humiliation (Borrego-Ruiz &amp; Fernández, <a href=""#r32"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""r32"">2024</a>). Therefore, individuals with schizophrenia often face significant barriers in several aspects of life, which underscores the pressing need to enhance mental health education and assistance services, and also to dispel the uncertainty around the complex interaction of genetic and environmental factors that underlie schizophrenia, thereby clarifying its causes and raising awareness about the experiences of people suffering from it. Ultimately, understanding the diverse influencing factors of schizophrenia could lead to more targeted intervention approaches, potentially reducing some of the social and individual burdens associated with the disorder.</p>"
"<p>This review presents various potential limitations that should be appropriately acknowledged: (i) it only considers specific infections that are central to the topic under study, but the pathophysiology of schizophrenia may involve more complex and multifactorial processes in which immune dysregulation could constitute a contributing factor rather than being attributable to a single infectious agent; (ii) the potential for prevention through specific treatments is not addressed, as the primary aim of this review is to delineate underlying pathological mechanisms rather than propose direct therapeutic interventions; (iii) the samples used in some of the studies reviewed, including both experimental and control groups, exhibit heterogeneity, which may affect the comparability of findings within the broader context of neuropsychiatric disorders; (iv) the contributions of maternal infections, in utero exposures, and postnatal infections are not separately analyzed, which may limit the clarity regarding their distinct roles in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia; and (v) the impact of confounding factors, including body mass index, drug use, genetic predisposition, and socioeconomic status, may introduce bias and affect the interpretation of the results.</p>"
"<p>Epidemiological evidence suggests a potential relationship between viruses and schizophrenia. Some viral infections, such as the influenza virus, can disrupt fetal brain development by activating the maternal immune system. Increases in inflammatory cytokine levels and changes in the expression of key genes observed in several viral infections (e.g., coronaviruses) may constitute potential links between these viral infections and schizophrenia. In addition, immune and non-immune genes associated with schizophrenia are likely to be targets of viral proteins.</p>"
"<p>Neuropsychiatric effects caused by antiviral drugs are common and represent significant adverse outcomes for viral treatment. From the data presented in this review, it can be concluded that antivirals may affect the CNS, although for most drugs, their action mechanisms are still unclear, and a strong relationship between antivirals and schizophrenia has not yet been established. Therefore, further research is required to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the neuropsychiatric effects of antiviral drugs.</p>"

"<p>Dysfunctional GABAergic and dopaminergic neurons are thought to exist in the ventral midbrain of patients with schizophrenia, yet transcriptional changes underpinning these abnormalities have not yet been localized to specific neuronal subsets. In the ventral midbrain, control over dopaminergic activity is maintained by both excitatory (glutamate) and inhibitory (GABA) input neurons. To elucidate neuron pathology at the single-cell level, we characterized the transcriptional diversity of distinct NEUN+ populations in the human ventral midbrain and then tested for schizophrenia-associated changes in neuronal subset proportions and gene activity changes within neuronal subsets.</p>"
"<p>Combining single nucleus RNA-sequencing with fluorescence-activated sorting of NEUN+ nuclei, we analysed 31 669 nuclei. Initially, we detected 18 transcriptionally distinct neuronal populations in the human ventral midbrain, including two ‘mixed’ populations. The presence of neuronal populations in the midbrain was orthogonally validated with immunohistochemical stainings. ‘Mixed’ populations contained nuclei expressing transcripts for vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (<em>SLC17A6</em>) and glutamate decarboxylase 2 (<em>GAD2</em>), but these transcripts were not typically co-expressed by the same nucleus. Upon more fine-grained subclustering of the two ‘mixed’ populations, 16 additional subpopulations were identified that were transcriptionally classified as excitatory or inhibitory. In the midbrains of individuals with schizophrenia, we observed potential differences in the proportions of two (sub)populations of excitatory neurons, two subpopulations of inhibitory neurons, one ‘mixed’ subpopulation, and one subpopulation of <em>TH</em>-expressing neurons.</p>"
"<p>This may suggest that transcriptional changes associated with schizophrenia broadly affect excitatory, inhibitory, and dopamine neurons. We detected 99 genes differentially expressed in schizophrenia compared to controls within neuronal subpopulations identified from the two ‘mixed’ populations, with most (67) changes within small GABAergic neuronal subpopulations. Overall, single-nucleus transcriptomic analyses profiled a high diversity of GABAergic neurons in the human ventral midbrain, identified putative shifts in the proportion of neuronal subpopulations, and suggested dysfunction of specific GABAergic subpopulations in schizophrenia, providing directions for future research.</p>"

"<p>To validate cluster annotation, we projected the 18 neuronal clusters to a previously published atlas of the adult human brain.<sup><a href=""#awae321-B26"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""awae321-B26"">26</a></sup> This publicly available atlas was processed to computationally extract 72 541 midbrain neurons, consisting primarily of neurons annotated as ‘splatter, ‘midbrain-derived inhibitory, and ‘thalamic excitatory’ neurons (<a href=""#sup1"" class=""usa-link"">Supplementary Fig. 2A</a>).

"<p>Summarizing, snRNAseq of NEUN+ nuclei indicated that the human ventral midbrain is constituted of approximately 18 major neuronal populations, which can be divided into nine inhibitory clusters, five excitatory, two ‘mixed’, and two monoaminergic clusters.</p>"
"<p>To determine transcriptional signatures of neuronal midbrain populations, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified for each neuronal cluster compared to all neuronal clusters (<a href=""#sup1"" class=""usa-link"">Supplementary Table 2</a>). Because we sought transcripts that were robustly marking each cluster, mRNAs were considered differentially enriched markers when the average log2 fold change was &gt; 0.25 and the adjusted <em>P</em>-value &lt; 0.05 (<a href=""#sup1"" class=""usa-link"">Supplementary Table 3</a>). Per cluster, GO terms associated with cluster markers are provided in <a href=""#sup1"" class=""usa-link"">Supplementary Table 4</a>, confirming the neuronal identity of clusters as indicated by GO terms such as ‘synapse assembly’, ‘axon development’, ‘synaptic vesicle exocytosis’ and ‘neurotransmitter transport’. Among the nine neuronal clusters identified as GABAergic, three clusters (inh-A, inh-B, and inh-D) had similar transcriptional profiles. Nevertheless, they differed in the abundance of certain transcripts such as neuropeptide S receptor 1 (<em>NPSR1</em>) for inh-B and hedgehog interacting protein (<em>HHIP</em>) for inh-D (<a href=""#awae321-F1"" class=""usa-link"">Fig. 1E</a> and <a href=""#sup1"" class=""usa-link"">Supplementary Table 3</a>). Comparing the annotation of a publicly available atlas<sup><a href=""#awae321-B26"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""awae321-B26"">26</a></sup> to the current clusters suggested inh-A, inh-B, and inh-D corresponded to neurons annotated as ‘midbrain-derived inhibitory’ neurons (<a href=""#sup1"" class=""usa-link"">Supplementary Fig. 2C</a>).</p>"
"<p>The GABAergic neuronal cluster inh-PVALB had the most distinct gene expression profile with 1079 enriched cluster markers (avg log2 fold change &gt; 0.25, adjusted <em>P</em>-value &lt; 0.05) (<a href=""#sup1"" class=""usa-link"">Supplementary Table 3</a>). Among the top 50 most significantly enriched transcripts in the inh-PVALB cluster was secretagogin (<em>SCGN</em>), encoding a calcium-binding protein, and <em>GRM1</em>, which codes for metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (<a href=""#awae321-F1"" class=""usa-link"">Fig. 1E</a> and <a href=""#sup1"" class=""usa-link"">Supplementary Table 3</a>). In inh-<em>SST-GAD2</em><sup>high</sup>, the neuronal cluster with the most abundant somatostatin (<em>SST</em>) expression, we observed enriched expression of prospero homeobox 1 (<em>PROX1</em>), neuron derived neurotrophic factor (<em>NDNF</em>) and cadherin 20 (<em>CDH20</em>) in the top 50 most significantly enriched transcripts (<a href=""#awae321-F1"" class=""usa-link"">Fig. 1E</a> and <a href=""#sup1"" class=""usa-link"">Supplementary Table 3</a>).</p>"
"<p>Inh-CCK was characterized by significantly enriched expression of <em>DLX6-AS1,</em> reelin <em>(RELN),</em> C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 14 (<em>CXCL14</em>), erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (<em>ERBB4</em>), adenosine deaminase RNA specific B2 (<em>ADARB2</em>), and distal-less homeobox 1 (<em>DLX1</em>) within the top 50 of most significantly enriched genes (<a href=""#awae321-F1"" class=""usa-link"">Fig. 1E and F</a> and <a href=""#sup1"" class=""usa-link"">Supplementary Table 3</a>).

"<p>The transcriptomic data was orthogonally validated by immunohistochemical stainings. <em>DLX1</em>, a marker gene for the inh-CCK cluster (<a href=""#awae321-F1"" class=""usa-link"">Fig. 1F</a>), positively stains nuclei with a neuronal morphology (brown staining), but not astrocytes (GFAP, black staining), in the periaqueductal grey, the nucleus of the third cranial nerve and the reticular formation of the midbrain (<a href=""#awae321-F1"" class=""usa-link"">Fig. 1</a><a href=""#awae321-F1"" class=""usa-link"">G and H</a>).</p>"

The DLX1 and ETV5 signals were found in different anatomical areas of the human midbrain, validating our identification of these markers for neuronal populations as predicted by our snRNAseq data.</p>"
"<p>Characterizing VGLUT2-expressing neurons in the midbrain is crucial, as glutamatergic VTA neurons project extensively to the prefrontal cortex and limbic structures, influencing critical neuronal circuits involved in learning, mood, motivation, and addiction behaviour.<sup><a href=""#awae321-B35"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""awae321-B35"">35</a></sup> In NEUN+ midbrain neurons, we identified five glutamatergic neuronal populations (<a href=""#awae321-F1"" class=""usa-link"">Fig. 1B and C</a>). Exc-VGLUT2-A, the largest glutamatergic neuron population (11.18% of total and 46.73% of glutamatergic clusters) had significantly enriched expression of the transcription factor basonuclin zinc finger protein 2 (<em>BNC2</em>) (<a href=""#awae321-F1"" class=""usa-link"">Fig. 1E</a>).

However, clustering did not separate the <em>SLC17A6</em> + <em>PVALB</em> + nuclei, indicating their close transcriptional relationship to <em>SLC17A6</em> + <em>PVALB</em>- nuclei.</p>"
"<p>A small population of glutamatergic neurons co-expressed both <em>SLC17A6</em> and <em>SLC17A7</em>, encoding VGLUT1 and -2. This dual expression led to their annotation as exc-VGLUT1 and 2 neurons (<a href=""#sup1"" class=""usa-link"">Supplementary Fig. 2G</a>). Transcripts among the top 50 most significantly enriched in these exc-VGLUT1 and 2 neurons included neuregulin 1 (<em>NRG1</em>), potassium voltage-gated channel Q5 (<em>KCNQ5</em>), dipeptidyl peptidase like 6 (<em>DPP6</em>), glypican 5 (<em>GPC5</em>) (<a href=""#sup1"" class=""usa-link"">Supplementary Table 3</a>). Cytochrome P450 family 26 subfamily B member 1 (<em>CYP26B1</em>), an enzyme involved in regulating retinoic acid levels in the brain,<sup><a href=""#awae321-B36"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""awae321-B36"">36</a></sup> did not rank among the top 50 most significant markers, but was exclusively expressed in the exc-VGLUT1 and 2 cluster (<a href=""#sup1"" class=""usa-link"">Supplementary Fig. 2H</a>). The presence of exc-VGLUT1 and 2 in the midbrain was corroborated at the protein level by immunohistochemical stainings. CYP26B1 signal (light brown) was detected in the periaqueductal grey and midline region, distinct from GFAP-positive cells (black) in control midbrain sections (<a href=""#sup1"" class=""usa-link"">Supplementary Fig. 2I</a>) suggesting that neuron-like cells express this protein.</p>"
"<p>Although previous studies report limited NEUN expression in DA neurons,<sup><a href=""#awae321-B34"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""awae321-B34"">34</a></sup> our analysis identified a small proportion of DA neurons using RBFOX3/NEUN+ sorting. Defining the diversity within DA neurons remains relevant since NEUN is a widely used immunohistochemical marker. Here, we defined DA neurons as nuclei that are co-expressing both tyrosine hydroxylase <em>TH</em> and the dopamine transporter <em>SLC6A3</em>/DAT. This constituted a subgroup of 123 DA neurons within the larger cluster annotated as ‘dopaminergic’, indicating that the DA cluster contained additional transcriptional heterogeneity. Focusing on the 123 ‘classical’ DA neurons, most of these neurons also had abundant expression of vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (<em>SLC18A2</em>) and dopamine receptor 2 (<em>DRD2</em>) but low average <em>RBFOX3</em> expression (<em>RBFOX3</em>/NEUN<sup>low</sup>) compared to non-DA neurons (<a href=""#sup1"" class=""usa-link"">Supplementary Fig. 3A</a>).</p>"
"<p>Within the total 123 DA transcriptional profiles, two subpopulations of DA neurons could be identified depending on their expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member A2 mRNA whose enzyme product makes retinoic acid (RA): <em>RBFOX3</em><sup>low</sup><em>ALDH1A2</em><sup>neg</sup> and <em>RBFOX3</em><sup>low</sup><em>ALDH1A1</em><sup>pos</sup> (<a href=""#sup1"" class=""usa-link"">Supplementary Fig. 3B</a> and Supplementary <a href=""#sup1"" class=""usa-link"">Table 5</a>).

"<p>In nuclei annotated as ‘mixed’, co-expression of <em>GAD2</em> and <em>SLC17A6</em> was detected in only ∼2% of the NEUN+ neuronal midbrain population.

To investigate if and how inhibitory neurons were distinct from excitatory neurons in the mixed clusters, we performed a more fine-grained subclustering of 6654 nuclei corresponding to two of our original clusters (mix-A and mix-B; <a href=""#awae321-F2"" class=""usa-link"">Fig. 2A</a>, inset).

This approach could identify gene expression changes occurring only within a (sub)population, which could remain undetected in bulk RNA sequencing analysis. Within each neuronal population, we assessed transcriptomic differences between schizophrenia and controls. We excluded exc-VGLUT-D, inh-E, and inh-PVALB due to insufficient case and nuclei counts (less than seven cases with more than 10 nuclei per case). Mix-A and mix-B were omitted as individual subclusters were investigated in detail in the next analysis. Given the number of comparisons, we applied strict FDR correction (FDR &lt; 0.05), and only 33 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, 20 of which were within an inhibitory neuronal population (<a href=""#awae321-F3"" class=""usa-link"">Fig. 3E</a> and <a href=""#sup1"" class=""usa-link"">Supplementary Table 13</a>).</p>"
"<p>The highest number of gene expression changes, in total 15, were observed in inh-CCK neurons, including decreased transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily C member 3 (<em>TRPC3</em>) expression and increased chondroitin sulfate <em>N</em>-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 1 (<em>CSGALNACT1</em>) expression (<a href=""#awae321-F3"" class=""usa-link"">Fig. 3F</a> and <a href=""#sup1"" class=""usa-link"">Supplementary Table 13</a>). The most pronounced gene expression changes (largest log<sub>2</sub>-fold changes) were detected in the DA population (<a href=""#sup1"" class=""usa-link"">Supplementary Fig. 7A</a> and <a href=""#sup1"" class=""usa-link"">Supplementary Table 13</a>). RBFOX3/NEUN<sup>low</sup> DA neurons had increased expression of ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 1 antisense RNA 1 (<em>ENTPD1-AS1</em>) and dopamine transporter 1 (<em>SLC6A3</em>/DAT1) in schizophrenia cases (<a href=""#sup1"" class=""usa-link"">Supplementary Fig. 7A</a> and <a href=""#sup1"" class=""usa-link"">Supplementary Table 13</a>). Furthermore, the DA population in schizophrenia had decreased expression of genes associated with the GO term ‘GTPase activity’ (<a href=""#sup1"" class=""usa-link"">Supplementary Fig. 7B</a>), such as Ras-related protein Rab-27B (<em>RAB27B</em>), and ADP ribosylation factor (<em>ARL17B</em>). In short, we identified 33 differentially expressed genes in schizophrenia, and almost two-thirds of DEGs were detected within GABAergic midbrain neurons, but the largest gene expression increase (in log fold change) was detected in the DA cluster.</p>"
"<p>Next, we investigated the transcriptional differences that could occur within the subpopulations identified by subclustering of ‘mixed’ neuronal populations (<a href=""#awae321-F2"" class=""usa-link"">Fig. 2A</a>). The subpopulations exc-CORIN, exc-SNCA<sup>high</sup>, inh-DCN, inh-LDB2<sup>high</sup>, and remaining-mix were excluded, due to insufficient cases providing more than 10 nuclei per case. Within the analysed subpopulations (exc-a, exc-b, exc-CBLN2, inh-A, inh-ALK, inh-B, inh-C, inh-CHODL-OTX2<sup>high</sup>, inh-MEIS2<sup>high</sup>, inh-TFAP2B, mix-TH-VGLUT3) a total of 99 DEGs were identified, of which 67 were within an inhibitory neuronal subpopulation (<a href=""#awae321-F3"" class=""usa-link"">Fig. 3G</a> and <a href=""#sup1"" class=""usa-link"">Supplementary Table 14</a>). Neurons classified into the inh-C cluster had the highest number of gene expression alterations, in total 48 (<a href=""#awae321-F3"" class=""usa-link"">Fig. 3G and H</a>). Among all neuronal subpopulations, the largest gene expression increase was observed for protein kinase CGMP-dependent 1 (<em>PRKG1</em>) (<a href=""#awae321-F3"" class=""usa-link"">Fig. 3H</a> and <a href=""#sup1"" class=""usa-link"">Supplementary Table 14</a>), which is associated with the GO term ‘calcium channel regulator activity’ (<a href=""#sup1"" class=""usa-link"">Supplementary Fig. 7D</a>) in inh-C neurons. Inh-C neurons also had increased expression of metabotropic glutamate receptors <em>GRM3</em> and <em>GRM8</em> in schizophrenia compared to controls (<a href=""#awae321-F3"" class=""usa-link"">Fig. 3H</a> and <a href=""#sup1"" class=""usa-link"">Supplementary Table 14</a>), associated with the GO term ‘glutamate receptor activity’ (<a href=""#sup1"" class=""usa-link"">Supplementary Fig. 7D</a>), and decreased expression of potassium voltage-gated channel interacting protein 4 (<em>KCNIP4</em>) and GABA-receptor subunit gamma 3 (<em>GABRG3</em>) (<a href=""#awae321-F3"" class=""usa-link"">Fig. 3H</a> and <a href=""#sup1"" class=""usa-link"">Supplementary Table 14</a>). Interesting to note were the differentially expressed genes in mix-TH-VGLUT3 neurons in schizophrenia (in total 10; <a href=""#awae321-F3"" class=""usa-link"">Fig. 3G</a>), including increased expression of glypican 6 (<em>GPC6</em>) in schizophrenia compared to controls (<a href=""#sup1"" class=""usa-link"">Supplementary Fig. 7C</a> and <a href=""#sup1"" class=""usa-link"">Supplementary Table 14</a>). Two differentially expressed genes associated with schizophrenia, <em>RGS6</em> and <em>PTPRK</em>, are detected within the exc-a subcluster and are recognized as high-confidence susceptibility genes for schizophrenia (<a href=""#sup1"" class=""usa-link"">Supplementary Fig. 7E</a> and <a href=""#sup1"" class=""usa-link"">Supplementary Tables 14</a> and <a href=""#sup1"" class=""usa-link"">15</a>).</p>"
"<p>Concluding, transcriptional changes between schizophrenia and control cases are most pronounced in inhibitory neuronal (sub)populations. Possibly, new genes (<em>RGS6</em> and <em>PTPRK</em>) have been identified in an excitatory neuronal subpopulation that might be important in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.</p>"
"<p>To connect GWAS results for schizophrenia to specific neuronal midbrain populations, we mapped the expression of schizophrenia GWAS genes onto the single-nucleus clusters (<a href=""#awae321-F3"" class=""usa-link"">Fig. 3I</a>). We used a curated GWAS gene set denoted as ‘high-confidence’, which was supported by more than two evidence sources in PsychEncode Consortium analysis<sup><a href=""#awae321-B27"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""awae321-B27"">27</a></sup> (<a href=""#sup1"" class=""usa-link"">Supplementary Table 15</a>). Genes were defined as detected in a population if the <em>z</em>-score of the average expression in the population was greater than 1.5. Inh-PVALB, inh-B and inh-A had the highest ratios, which are calculated by detected schizophrenia genes divided by the total number of detected genes per cluster (<a href=""#awae321-F3"" class=""usa-link"">Fig. 3I</a>). The highest number of schizophrenia susceptibility genes (52 genes) were detected in the population of inh-PVALB neurons compared to other midbrain neurons. Taking both the large number of genes detected in inh-PVALB neurons and the multiple populations that were tested into account, the overlap between the GWAS-identified gene set (213 genes) and expressed genes in inh-PVALB neurons (4619 genes) was not significant (Fisher’s exact test, <em>P</em> = 0.018, <em>P</em>-adj = 0.32). The schizophrenia susceptibility genes detected in inh-PVALB neurons in the midbrain included genes such as <em>DGKZ</em>, <em>INPP4B</em> and <em>TKT</em> (<a href=""#sup1"" class=""usa-link"">Supplementary Table 16</a>). The schizophrenia susceptibility genes detected in inh-PVALB were associated with the KEGG Pathway ‘Phosphatidylinositol signalling pathway’ and GO terms ‘lipid modification’ and ‘glycerolipid metabolic process’ (<a href=""#sup1"" class=""usa-link"">Supplementary Table 16</a>). To summarize, inh-PVALB, inh-B and inh-A had the highest ratio of detected schizophrenia susceptibility genes in neurons analysed from these 28 cases.</p>"
"<p>Midbrain samples from 14 schizophrenia and 14 control cases obtained from the Stanley Medical Research Institute (SMRI) Array Collection were analysed by sn RNAseq of fluorescence-activated nucleus sorted NEUN+ nuclei. Selected transcriptional markers were confirmed at the protein level with immunohistochemical stainings, validating the existence of neuronal populations predicted by snRNAseq in the midbrain. We studied the ventral midbrain because this is the region where altered functioning of GABAergic, glutamatergic and DA circuits in schizophrenia is likely to occur. We discovered subtly altered relative abundance and transcriptional differences within neuronal populations (clusters) and subpopulations (subclusters) of glutamatergic, GABAergic and DA neurons in schizophrenia by analysing 16 616 nuclei from schizophrenia and 15 053 nuclei from control cases. The relative abundance of neuronal subpopulations was changed in the ventral midbrain of patients with schizophrenia, indicated by subtle proportional shifts in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. We also detected differences in the transcript levels within neurons between patients and controls, with a preponderance of deviations within the GABAergic neurons, as most transcriptional changes (20 out of 33 for populations, 67 out of 99 for subpopulations) were identified within these inhibitory neurons. Schizophrenia-associated differentially expressed genes in the midbrain and cortex are not overlapping (data not shown), indicating brain region-specific alterations in schizophrenia, as previously described.<sup><a href=""#awae321-B42"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""awae321-B42"">42</a></sup> This highlights the need for individual analysis of brain regions in schizophrenia research.</p>"
"<p>The proportion of neurons annotated as excitatory VGLUT1 and 2 neurons was potentially increased in schizophrenia and those annotated as excitatory CORIN+ neurons were reduced compared to controls. This may suggest that the balance of excitatory output of the midbrain is altered in schizophrenia, favoring the information carried by VGLUT1 and 2+ neurons over that carried by CORIN+ neurons. Possibly, these shifts could indicate that in patients with schizophrenia, changes occur in the type of midbrain glutamate input onto other midbrain neurons. In support of this, we detected altered expression of metabotropic glutamate receptors (<em>GRM3, GRM8</em>) on inhibitory neurons in subpopulation inh-C and deviant expression of synapse differentiation induced gene 1 (<em>SYNDIG1</em>), which encodes an activity-dependent AMPA-receptor auxiliary subunit,<sup><a href=""#awae321-B43"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""awae321-B43"">43</a></sup> in neurons classified as inh-B. These findings suggest that changes in midbrain glutamate neurons may lead to synaptic changes within the midbrain.</p>"
"<p>At the transcription level, gene expression changes in schizophrenia were mostly detected within the low abundant GABAergic (sub)populations, including inh-CCK and inh-C. Additionally, we found that inhibitory <em>PVALB</em>-expressing neurons expressed many schizophrenia risk genes. Multiple differentially expressed genes (<em>KCNIP4</em>, <em>GRM3</em>, <em>PRKG1</em>, <em>NPY</em> for inh-C, and <em>TRPC3</em> for inh-CCK) were related to glutamate reception and calcium channel activity, indicating these processes are altered within inhibitory midbrain neurons in schizophrenia. Such alterations may lead to decreased or otherwise deviant excitability of these inhibitory neurons which subsequently may influence DA neuron activity either directly or indirectly.<sup><a href=""#awae321-B14"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""awae321-B14"">14</a></sup> Dopamine hyperactivity is known as a final common pathway to give rise to psychotic vulnerability, the hallmark of schizophrenia.<sup><a href=""#awae321-B44"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""awae321-B44"">44-47</a></sup></p>"
"<p>Contrary to the hypothesis of decreased inhibitory influence in the midbrain, we found that the proportions of two subpopulations of inhibitory neurons (inh-ALK and inh-B) were potentially increased in schizophrenia, which may indicate a shift in the type of inhibitory control within the ventral midbrain, rather than a loss of inhibitory neurons.</p>"
"<p>The proportion of neurons co-expressing transcripts for <em>TH</em> and vesicular glutamate transporters was reduced with marginal significance in schizophrenia compared to controls. Since these DA neurons co-expressed glutamate transporters, they may correspond to VTA dopamine neurons that project to limbic regions and to the prefrontal cortex.<sup><a href=""#awae321-B48"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""awae321-B48"">48</a>,<a href=""#awae321-B49"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""awae321-B49"">49</a></sup> This aligns with the loss of dopamine innervation that has been reported in the prefrontal and temporal cortex in patients with schizophrenia.<sup><a href=""#awae321-B50"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""awae321-B50"">50</a>,<a href=""#awae321-B51"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""awae321-B51"">51</a></sup> In support of reduced dopamine synthesis capability in the schizophrenia midbrain, less <em>TH</em> mRNA and TH protein were measured in the midbrain of patients with schizophrenia by us and others.<sup><a href=""#awae321-B15"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""awae321-B15"">15</a>,<a href=""#awae321-B52"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""awae321-B52"">52</a>,<a href=""#awae321-B53"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""awae321-B53"">53</a></sup> However, results of no change or an increase in <em>TH</em> in the schizophrenia midbrain have also been reported.<sup><a href=""#awae321-B45"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""awae321-B45"">45</a>,<a href=""#awae321-B54"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""awae321-B54"">54</a>,<a href=""#awae321-B55"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""awae321-B55"">55</a></sup> We emphasize that we examined NEUN+ dopamine neurons, representing only a subset of dopamine neurons, including those expressing <em>ALDH1A1</em> and others that may co-synthesize glutamate. This dopamine-glutamate co-transmission has been linked to salience attribution in response to environmental cues,<sup><a href=""#awae321-B48"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""awae321-B48"">48</a>,<a href=""#awae321-B56"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""awae321-B56"">56</a></sup> which is known to be aberrant in patients with psychosis.<sup><a href=""#awae321-B8"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""awae321-B8"">8</a>,<a href=""#awae321-B57"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""awae321-B57"">57</a></sup> While the need for additional validation remains evident, particularly for the <em>TH</em>-expressing populations described here, our study suggests the loss of a potentially vulnerable subpopulation of DA neurons, which may also co-transmit glutamate in patients with schizophrenia.</p>"
"<p>‘Mixed’ neuronal populations uniquely comprised nuclei expressing GABA- and glutamate-related genes and did not separate on the two-dimensional UMAP plot. A similar neuronal population was reported in an adult human brain atlas, referring to these neurons as ‘splatter neurons’.<sup><a href=""#awae321-B26"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""awae321-B26"">26</a></sup> Computational projection of ‘mixed’ clusters onto the adult human brain atlas confidently assigned ‘mixed’ clusters as ‘splatter neurons’. Splatter/mixed neurons were transcriptionally more heterogeneous than any other neuronal population from the same dissection, were reproducibly identified, and were not due to quality metrics like total UMI counts. The midbrain, thalamus, and hindbrain regions had the highest relative abundance of ‘splatter neurons’, while the lowest abundance was observed in the telencephalon.<sup><a href=""#awae321-B26"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""awae321-B26"">26</a></sup> More schizophrenia-associated transcriptional changes were identified in our subpopulations of splatter/mixed neurons than were identified in the main populations. This underscores the importance of investigating the phenotypes and functions of ‘splatter neurons’ in future schizophrenia research.</p>"
"<p>Two additional studies have applied snRNAseq to investigate the human midbrain, focusing on total cellular diversity resulting in a relatively limited number of neurons in the data (<em>n</em> = 5332 neuronal nuclei in Smajic <em>et al.</em><sup><a href=""#awae321-B20"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""awae321-B20"">20</a></sup> and <em>n</em> = 195 in Agarwal <em>et al.</em><sup><a href=""#awae321-B58"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""awae321-B58"">58</a></sup>), whereas we have examined over 30 000 NEUN+ nuclei demonstrating that selecting neurons based on marker proteins is advantageous. Indeed, a recent snRNAseq study used sorting with a selective dopamine neuron marker NR4A2 (rather than NEUN) to examine over 300 000 midbrain nuclei (22 000 dopamine neurons) and identified a subpopulation of dysfunctional ventral tier DA neurons associated with Parkinson’s disease.<sup><a href=""#awae321-B40"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""awae321-B40"">40</a></sup> Complementary, we analysed high numbers of non-DA neurons in the human ventral midbrain. This allowed us to investigate less common GABAergic cell populations, making a unique contribution to schizophrenia research. Other studies that used a similar technique focused on other brain areas in schizophrenia. For example, Batiuk <em>et al.</em><sup><a href=""#awae321-B59"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""awae321-B59"">59</a></sup> focused on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and found specific upper-layer GABAergic interneurons and lower-layer pyramidal neurons that were transcriptionally affected in schizophrenia. This affirms that schizophrenia-associated changes impact not just one type of neuron, but various neuronal subtypes across distinct brain regions.</p>"
"<p>Several weaknesses of the current study might limit our identification of schizophrenia-associated transcriptional changes. Foremost, the NEUN+ sorting procedure did not completely capture certain neuronal midbrain populations, such as the serotonergic neurons, PVALB-expressing neurons, and all varieties of DA neurons. This may have limited our ability to detect a previously published<sup><a href=""#awae321-B15"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""awae321-B15"">15</a></sup> reduction of <em>GAD1</em> and <em>PVALB</em> transcript levels in schizophrenia samples in this population. Furthermore, the clinical heterogeneity among the donors and the disease state at the time of tissue collection can vary in this schizophrenia cohort. We appreciate that the investigation of a heterogeneous and multifactorial disease such as schizophrenia will benefit from an even higher number of cases, a greater total number of nuclei per case, and more sequencing depth per nucleus. Additionally, we did not take the inflammatory status of the tissue into account in this study.<sup><a href=""#awae321-B60"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""awae321-B60"">60</a></sup></p>"
"<p>Differences in subcluster contribution between schizophrenia and control cases hint toward changes in small subclusters in our dataset. Although schizophrenia is a devastating disease that profoundly affects patients’ behaviour, it is not directly life-threatening. Therefore, the subtle cellular changes observed may align with the underlying biology of the disease.</p>"
"<p>Gradient centrifugation during nuclei isolation separates cytosolic mRNA from mRNA that is captured in the nucleus. Previous studies have shown that nucleic and cytosolic mRNA transcripts in neurons differ quite substantially.<sup><a href=""#awae321-B61"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""awae321-B61"">61</a>,<a href=""#awae321-B62"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""awae321-B62"">62</a></sup> Possibly, greater gene expression differences between schizophrenia and control cases could have been identified in the cytosolic mRNA fraction of analysed neurons. As with all novel findings, the biological relevance and transcriptomic changes we observed between schizophrenia and control cases in small subclusters, need to be verified in future studies.</p>"
"<p>In summary, analysing high numbers of NEUN+ midbrain neurons, we observed that schizophrenia subtly affects the composition of various neuronal types (glutamatergic, GABAergic, and TH-VGLUT3-expressing neurons) and is mostly associated with gene expression changes within specific GABAergic subpopulations. These findings offer novel insights for further investigations, ultimately enhancing our understanding of the molecular basis of schizophrenia.</p>"

"<p>Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric illness affecting almost 25 million people worldwide and is conceptualized as a disorder of synaptic plasticity and brain connectivity. Antipsychotics are the primary pharmacological treatment after more than sixty years after their introduction in therapy. Two findings hold true for all presently available antipsychotics. First, all antipsychotics occupy the dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) as an antagonist or partial agonist, even if with different affinity; second, D2R occupancy is the necessary and probably the sufficient mechanism for antipsychotic effect despite the complexity of antipsychotics’ receptor profile. D2R occupancy is followed by coincident or divergent intracellular mechanisms, implying the contribution of cAMP regulation, β-arrestin recruitment, and phospholipase A activation, to quote some of the mechanisms considered canonical. However, in recent years, novel mechanisms related to dopamine function beyond or together with D2R occupancy have emerged. Among these potentially non-canonical mechanisms, the role of Na<sup>2+</sup> channels at the dopamine at the presynaptic site, dopamine transporter (DAT) involvement as the main regulator of dopamine concentration at synaptic clefts, and the putative role of antipsychotics as chaperones for intracellular D2R sequestration, should be included. These mechanisms expand the fundamental role of dopamine in schizophrenia therapy and may have relevance to considering putatively new strategies for treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS), an extremely severe condition epidemiologically relevant and affecting almost 30% of schizophrenia patients. Here, we performed a critical evaluation of the role of antipsychotics in synaptic plasticity, focusing on their canonical and non-canonical mechanisms of action relevant to the treatment of schizophrenia and their subsequent implication for the pathophysiology and potential therapy of TRS.</p>"

This mechanism is coherent with a “dopaminocentric hypothesis” of psychosis that was conceptualized almost 50 years ago and is still considered fundamental [<a href=""#B5-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B5-ijms-24-05945"">5</a>,<a href=""#B6-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B6-ijms-24-05945"">6</a>,<a href=""#B7-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B7-ijms-24-05945"">7</a>], even if relevant updates and revisitation of findings from imaging [<a href=""#B8-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B8-ijms-24-05945"">8</a>,<a href=""#B9-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B9-ijms-24-05945"">9</a>,<a href=""#B10-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B10-ijms-24-05945"">10</a>], post-mortem [<a href=""#B11-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B11-ijms-24-05945"">11</a>,<a href=""#B12-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B12-ijms-24-05945"">12</a>], and modeling studies [<a href=""#B13-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B13-ijms-24-05945"">13</a>] have incorporated other neurotransmitter mechanisms, primarily the glutamatergic ones. However, the same findings call for a more stringent re-evaluation of antipsychotics’ MOA within the dopamine system, starting from the main target: the D2R. A critical appraisal of the non-canonical dopamine effects of antipsychotics is not only of significative heuristic value but even more relevant for the translational possibility of exploring novel therapeutic strategies.</p>"
"<p>Novel strategies are even more needed with reference to those patients who do not respond to treatment with antipsychotics using at least two antipsychotics (one should be an atypical or new generation drug) at a dose of 600 mg/equivalent of chlorpromazine for at least 6 weeks of treatment, these patients are defined as treatment-resistant [<a href=""#B14-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B14-ijms-24-05945"">14</a>].

"<p>Considering that (i) at present, the dopaminergic strategy to tackle psychosis has been demonstrated to be effective, at least for positive symptoms, (ii) D2R occupancy could be limited by the potential onset of motor and other adverse events, and (iii) multiple domains of the disorder are indirectly related to dopamine through its modulation by other neurotransmitters systems, we addressed the following questions:</p>"
"<p class=""display-inline"">Is there space for more dopaminergic strategy beyond dopamine D2R occupancy in psychosis treatment?</p>"

"<p>Dopamine dichotomic cortical–subcortical involvement in schizophrenia pathophysiology, may suggest the coexistence of cortical “hypodopaminergia” and subcortical “hyperdopaminergia” associated with the dysfunction of other neurotransmitter systems, mainly serotonergic and glutamatergic ones [<a href=""#B16-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B16-ijms-24-05945"">16</a>,<a href=""#B17-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B17-ijms-24-05945"">17</a>]. Treatment with antipsychotics occupying mainly, if not exclusively, the D2R, may counterbalance the hyperdopaminergic state, especially at the striatal level, which is considered the rationale behind antipsychotic action. However, the blockade of D2Rs in the mesocortical, nigrostriatal, and tuberoinfundibular pathways has also been linked to several side effects, such as worsening of cognitive and negative symptoms, extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), and hyperprolactinemia [<a href=""#B18-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B18-ijms-24-05945"">18</a>]. Furthermore, it has been proposed that the sustained occupancy of D2Rs could potentially be linked to antipsychotic tolerance, dopamine supersensitivity psychosis (DSP), and tardive dyskinesia (TD) [<a href=""#B19-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B19-ijms-24-05945"">19</a>]. The mechanisms underlying DSP and TD have been associated with long-term blockade of D2R, leading to upregulation of the receptors, an increase in D2R density, and/or a shift from a “low affinity” to a “high affinity” state [<a href=""#B20-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B20-ijms-24-05945"">20</a>,<a href=""#B21-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B21-ijms-24-05945"">21</a>], potentially resulting in “dopamine supersensitivity”.</p>"
"<p>Iyo and coworkers hypothesized that there is an optimal range in the number of D2Rs available for dopamine binding to achieve adequate treatment in patients with schizophrenia [<a href=""#B20-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B20-ijms-24-05945"">20</a>]. The authors estimated the optimal D2R occupancy by assuming that the plasma range of antipsychotics was constant while the D2R density varied. The results showed that the plasma level of antipsychotics increased and decreased along with D2R density, estimating that the optimal D2R occupancy range was 65% to 78%, rising to a range of 82% to 89% with increased receptor density, and 42% to 63% with decreased receptor density [<a href=""#B20-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B20-ijms-24-05945"">20</a>]. The results also indicated that the reduction in the plasma level of antipsychotics was greater in patients with higher D2R density, as they needed increased doses of antipsychotics to achieve optimal receptor occupancy. On the other hand, in patients with lower D2R density, a reduced dose of antipsychotic could achieve optimal receptor occupancy, resulting in liability for extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) [<a href=""#B20-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B20-ijms-24-05945"">20</a>]. Kruyer and coauthors have recently demonstrated that behavioral supersensitivity could be related to long-lasting synaptic plasticity processes at pre-, peri-, and postsynaptic sites, which includes the insertion of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable α-ammino-3-idrossi-5-metil-4-isossazol-propionic acid receptors (AMPARs) and the loss of inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) dependent on D2R in the middle spiny neurons of the <em>nucleus accumbens</em> (NAc) [<a href=""#B22-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B22-ijms-24-05945"">22</a>]. These findings underlined hyperexcitability causing locomotor sensitization associated with behavioral endophenotypes of resistance to antipsychotic treatment. In this context, the chemogenetic restoration of inhibitory postsynaptic currents in D2R could prevent antipsychotic-induced supersensitivity [<a href=""#B22-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B22-ijms-24-05945"">22</a>]. Furthermore, an inflammatory-based mechanism implicated in DSP development could be related to oxidative stress resulting from free radicals released by dopamine metabolism. Indeed, dopaminergic neurons in the <em>substantia nigra</em> are sensitive to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and to the dysregulation of cellular redox homeostasis generated by catecholamine metabolism [<a href=""#B23-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B23-ijms-24-05945"">23</a>], which is possibly relevant for TD. There is evidence of increased oxidative stress caused by lipid peroxidation associated with neuronal damage in patients with TRS compared to those responsive ones, potentially significant for DSP and TD [<a href=""#B24-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B24-ijms-24-05945"">24</a>]. Preclinical studies in rats have shown that neuroleptic-induced TD is also associated with changes in the expression of serotonin 5-HT<sub>2</sub> receptors (5-HT<sub>2</sub>Rs) [<a href=""#B25-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B25-ijms-24-05945"">25</a>]. Antipsychotic treatment may reduce the density of 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>Rs in the prelimbic cortex and NAc while increasing their density in the caudate-putamen. Therefore, 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R activation is necessary for the full expression of DSP induced by antipsychotics, modulating dopamine-dependent behavior. These effects are potentially related to changes in 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R density in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and striatum, suggesting the role of the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R blockade in the regulation of antipsychotic-induced DSP. Moreover, a mechanistic link has been proposed between the development of TD and serotonin 5-HT<sub>6</sub>R in patients with Parkinson’s disease and transplanted with dopaminergic neurons. The 5-HT<sub>6</sub>R could be implicated in the dopamine release responsible for the “transplant-induced dyskinesia” side effect induced by the inhibition of autoreceptor feedback [<a href=""#B26-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B26-ijms-24-05945"">26</a>]. For selective high-affinity D2R antagonism, both clinical and preclinical studies have found an association between poor cognitive performance mediated by the disruption of D2R-mediated signaling [<a href=""#B27-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B27-ijms-24-05945"">27</a>], particularly in the PFC [<a href=""#B28-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B28-ijms-24-05945"">28</a>]. D2R activation has also been shown to be relevant to dopamine uptake by vesicular monoamine transporter-2 (VMAT-2) [<a href=""#B29-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B29-ijms-24-05945"">29</a>], suggesting that its pharmacological modulation may be a non-canonical therapeutic target in the treatment of schizophrenia [<a href=""#B30-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B30-ijms-24-05945"">30</a>]. Despite the elusive neurobiology of DSP, few lines of evidence may suggest a link with TRS [<a href=""#B31-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B31-ijms-24-05945"">31</a>]. Pharmacogenetics studies have demonstrated a significant relationship between the <em>DRD2</em> gene polymorphism -141 C Ins/Del and poor response to antipsychotics [<a href=""#B32-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B32-ijms-24-05945"">32</a>,<a href=""#B33-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B33-ijms-24-05945"">33</a>], suggesting the contribution of D2R in the development of DSP and TRS [<a href=""#B31-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B31-ijms-24-05945"">31</a>,<a href=""#B34-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B34-ijms-24-05945"">34</a>].</p>"
"<p>At the molecular level, the mechanisms responsible for D2R trafficking could contribute to DSP [<a href=""#B35-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B35-ijms-24-05945"">35</a>]. β-arrestin 2 (ARRB2) is directly responsible for internalizing D2R phosphorylated by G protein-coupled receptor kinase 6 (GRK6) and may activate the cellular signaling mediated by the AKT/PP2A/ARRB2 complex, resulting in delayed signaling compared with early G-protein-mediated signaling [<a href=""#B36-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B36-ijms-24-05945"">36</a>,<a href=""#B37-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B37-ijms-24-05945"">37</a>]. In addition, the absence of ARRB2 promoted the early G protein pathway by disrupting delayed G-protein-independent signaling [<a href=""#B36-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B36-ijms-24-05945"">36</a>,<a href=""#B37-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B37-ijms-24-05945"">37</a>].

"<p>There is growing evidence that antipsychotics could act as chaperones in the trafficking of dopamine receptors from the intracellular site to the membrane surface; however, not all antipsychotics are equal regarding this feature. Aripiprazole and clozapine have less propensity to act as chaperones of D2R, preventing their translocation and possible upregulation to the cell surface, therefore, this differential mechanism may represent a putative non-canonical MOA to reduce the onset of DSP [<a href=""#B46-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B46-ijms-24-05945"">46</a>,<a href=""#B47-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B47-ijms-24-05945"">47</a>].</p>"
"<p>Even though all antipsychotics occupy both D2R and D3R, the role of the latter one has received less attention in the past, probably for the reported low density and more restricted distribution in a few brain regions. However, more recently, a growing interest at both clinical and preclinical levels has considerably changed the appraisal of the D3R in the framework of antipsychotic therapy. At the clinical level, the introduction of cariprazine has significantly marked the role of dopamine D3R as a relevant addition to the schizophrenia pharmacological armamentarium. Cariprazine is the first available antipsychotic that preferentially acts as a partial agonist at D3R, with K<sub>i</sub> = 0.085 nM, higher than the one for the D2R (K<sub>i</sub> = 0.49 nM) [<a href=""#B48-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B48-ijms-24-05945"">48</a>], demonstrating significantly better efficacy on prevalent negative symptoms in schizophrenia patients compared to a full D2R antagonist, such as risperidone [<a href=""#B49-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B49-ijms-24-05945"">49</a>,<a href=""#B50-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B50-ijms-24-05945"">50</a>].

Of interest, the genetic disruption of the dysbindin gene (<em>DTNBP1</em> gene), one of the top candidate genes associated with schizophrenia, affects the intracellular trafficking of D3R. Notably, in both schizophrenia and genetic animal model of the disorder, the concomitant reduction in D3R and <em>DTNBP1</em> gene expression was associated with pro-cognitive effects. The D3R/dysbindin interaction has been shown to promote D2R/D3R imbalance by favoring an increase in D2R signaling in the PFC but not in the striatum [<a href=""#B55-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B55-ijms-24-05945"">55</a>], underlining the potential role of regional D2R/D3R reciprocal ratio of occupancy and D3R antagonism in improving cognitive symptoms in schizophrenia. D3R signaling is emerging as a possible regulatory mechanism of parvalbumin neuron-dependent gamma oscillations (γ-oscillations are believed to be a major organizer of brain functional networking [<a href=""#B56-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B56-ijms-24-05945"">56</a>] and have been demonstrated to be abnormal in schizophrenia patients [<a href=""#B57-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B57-ijms-24-05945"">57</a>]). γ-oscillations are 30-90 Hz bursts mainly generated in the cortical–subcortical brain regions, mainly by parvalbumin-positive γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) interneurons, on the other side, have been demonstrated to be abnormal in post-mortem studies on schizophrenia patients, and animal modeling γ-oscillations have been shown to be deranged by N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) blockade [<a href=""#B58-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B58-ijms-24-05945"">58</a>].</p>"
"<p>D4Rs are predominately located in the prefrontal and temporal areas, sparing the basal ganglia, whereby compounds with a higher affinity for D4Rs than D2Rs could selectively reduce dopaminergic tone in the mesolimbic and mesocortical systems without affecting the nigrostriatal pathway and not producing motor side effects [<a href=""#B59-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B59-ijms-24-05945"">59</a>]. Furthermore, as D4Rs localized on both pyramidal and GABAergic neurons in the cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, <em>globus pallidus</em>, and <em>substantia nigra</em> [<a href=""#B60-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B60-ijms-24-05945"">60</a>], it has been hypothesized that selective D4R antagonists could, directly and indirectly, modulate glutamatergic transmission [<a href=""#B60-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B60-ijms-24-05945"">60</a>].

It is possible that antagonism at D4R and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> produces discriminative stimulus effects of “atypicality” similar to clozapine, but the additional antagonism at D2R makes it similar to typical antipsychotics [<a href=""#B64-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B64-ijms-24-05945"">64</a>]. It is noteworthy that the antipsychotic clozapine may interact with D4R concerning its tolerability profile and adverse effects. Indeed, the 120 bp duplication in the <em>DRD4</em> gene is significantly associated with clozapine-induced sialorrhea, suggesting that this duplication may increase the risk of sialorrhea in TRS patients treated with clozapine [<a href=""#B65-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B65-ijms-24-05945"">65</a>].</p>"
"<p>Dopamine D1R and related intracellular signaling have been longly considered a complex puzzle in the dynamic of dopamine under antipsychotic treatment [<a href=""#B66-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B66-ijms-24-05945"">66</a>]. One major issue is that the increased release of dopamine in schizophrenia is supposed to hit both classes of dopamine receptors, D1- and D2-like, and on the other side, all antipsychotics, with few exceptions (asenapine and clozapine), have relatively low affinity for D1R compared to D2R affinity and occupancy/antagonism. Therefore, D1R remains, except for asenapine and clozapine, a “black spot” in the dopaminergic-related effects of antipsychotics in terms of efficacy. Despite the low D1R affinity of antipsychotics, recently, some non-canonical mechanisms have emerged supporting an indirect role of D1R in antipsychotics action among, for example, chlorpromazine, a D1R-like inverse agonist in the mouse brain, which reduces Ca<sub>v2.2</sub> currents by occluding D1R-like constitutive activity [<a href=""#B67-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B67-ijms-24-05945"">67</a>,<a href=""#B68-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B68-ijms-24-05945"">68</a>].

Lynch and co-workers proposed that dopamine hypoactivity in the NAc could be behind the negative symptoms of schizophrenia and that treatments with low-dose dopamine agonists could mimic the behavioral profile of negative symptoms via direct stimulation of D1Rs in the PFC [<a href=""#B70-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B70-ijms-24-05945"">70</a>]. Accordingly, clozapine’s efficacy for negative symptoms could be partially ascribed to the blockade of D1Rs in the PFC, resulting in enhanced dopaminergic activity in the NAc favored by glutamate [<a href=""#B70-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B70-ijms-24-05945"">70</a>].

"<p>Presynaptic dopaminergic terminals and dopamine transporter in schizophrenia.

The antipsychotic mechanism of action involving the presynaptic dopaminergic terminal.

The formation of a ‘reserve’ of presynaptic D2 autoreceptors that interact mainly with endogenous dopamine, whereas postsynaptic D2Rs could be mostly occupied by antipsychotics.

"<p>Clinical studies have estimated that the time course of D2R occupancy in the living human brain achieves adequate central D2R blockade within hours of antipsychotic administration, whereas the appreciable antipsychotic effect appears after days or weeks of treatment [<a href=""#B80-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B80-ijms-24-05945"">80</a>]. However, the delayed clinical antipsychotic effect can be explained both by the drug’s action at postsynaptic D2R and its MOA at the presynaptic dopaminergic terminal. In this regard, preclinical studies showed that weak-base antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, chlorpromazine, clozapine, and risperidone) could accumulate in the synaptic vesicles of presynaptic dopaminergic terminals, resulting in a significant release of extracellular drug concentrations that inhibit presynaptic function in an activity-dependent manner [<a href=""#B78-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B78-ijms-24-05945"">78</a>,<a href=""#B81-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B81-ijms-24-05945"">81</a>] (<a href=""#ijms-24-05945-f002"" class=""usa-link"">Figure 2</a>). In this context, it has been proposed that released levels of antipsychotics may recycle with synaptic vesicles by exerting an autoinhibitory effect on vesicular exocytosis, promoted by inhibition of voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) and dependent on the intensity of stimulation, regulating synaptic transmission [<a href=""#B78-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B78-ijms-24-05945"">78</a>]. Therefore, treatment with antipsychotics could generate an intracellular drug store co-released by vesicles together with endogenous dopamine, resulting in the inhibition of presynaptic VGSCs, which in turn regulate dopamine release with an autoinhibitory effect [<a href=""#B78-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B78-ijms-24-05945"">78</a>]. Another antipsychotic MOA hypothesized the formation of a “reserve” of presynaptic D2R autoreceptors while postsynaptic D2Rs would be instead occupied by antipsychotics. Endogenous dopamine would thereby mainly interact with D2 autoreceptors, reducing the presynaptic synthesis and release of dopamine and leading to an indirect antipsychotic effect [<a href=""#B5-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B5-ijms-24-05945"">5</a>]. However, it has been shown that the initial increase in synaptic dopamine availability after exposure to antipsychotics may decrease over time by reducing dopamine levels during chronic treatment resulting in a loss of antipsychotic efficacy [<a href=""#B5-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B5-ijms-24-05945"">5</a>]. Therefore, the reasons for drug tolerance or treatment failure could lie in the reduced dopamine levels at dopaminergic synapses and the consequent lack of stimulation of the presynaptic D2R reserve. Furthermore, it has been proposed that restoration of initial synaptic dopamine levels may improve antipsychotic efficacy in chronic treatment, suggesting the blockade of dopamine transporter (DAT) as a therapeutic non-conventional option [<a href=""#B5-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B5-ijms-24-05945"">5</a>]. This evidence extends the canonical view of antipsychotics acting at postsynaptic receptors to the non-canonical action at the presynaptic dopaminergic terminal, either through inhibition of VGSCs or through the indirect stimulation of the D2 autoreceptor reserve. This insight may be relevant to elucidate the complex changes induced by antipsychotics within synapses but also shed light on DAT blockade as an additional treatment to revert antipsychotic treatment failure, such as in the TRS condition (<a href=""#ijms-24-05945-f002"" class=""usa-link"">Figure 2</a>).</p>"
"<p>Antipsychotics have, with some exceptions (i.e., amisulpride and other benzamides), a complex receptor profile even if dopamine D2R occupancy or blockade is considered to be the necessary and possible sufficient mechanism of antipsychotic action.

"<p>A trait that has been considered possibly critical for the atypicality of almost all new-generation antipsychotics is 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> antagonism; specifically, a better affinity for 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> over D2R, and thus a high 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>/D2R ratio is considered a possible molecular predictor of atypicality, whose clinically and original definition is the low liability to elicit EPS [<a href=""#B82-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B82-ijms-24-05945"">82</a>]. In the framework of dopamine–serotonin receptor “cooperation” and with respect to the possible non-canonical dopaminergic MOA of antipsychotic drugs, an emergent role has been attributed to the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>/D2R dimers. Several preclinical in vitro and in vivo studies have identified dimerization of 5-HT<sub>2</sub> with D2R in rat striatum [<a href=""#B82-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B82-ijms-24-05945"">82</a>,<a href=""#B83-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B83-ijms-24-05945"">83</a>,<a href=""#B84-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B84-ijms-24-05945"">84</a>]. Specifically, it showed that stimulation of 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>/D2R dimers with D2R agonists is antagonized by co-administration of 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>-agonists, suggesting a 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>-mediated trans-inhibition of D2Rs, resulting in increased G<sub>q</sub> compared with G<sub>i</sub> signaling [<a href=""#B85-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B85-ijms-24-05945"">85</a>]. Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> can form dimers with metabotropic glutamate receptor 2 (mGluR2) [<a href=""#B86-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B86-ijms-24-05945"">86</a>,<a href=""#B87-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B87-ijms-24-05945"">87</a>]. In this context, 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>/mGluR2 heterodimerization could potentiate mGluR2-G<sub>i</sub> signaling and inhibit 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>-G<sub>q</sub> one [<a href=""#B88-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B88-ijms-24-05945"">88</a>].

In addition, post-mortem studies in the cortex of untreated schizophrenia patients found higher expression of 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> and lower expression of mGluR2, which might reflect a predisposing pattern to psychosis, indicating that the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>/mGluR2 complex might be involved in the altered cortical processes of schizophrenia resulting in a promising unconventional target for the treatment of psychosis [<a href=""#B86-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B86-ijms-24-05945"">86</a>].

Specifically, an increase in the cortical silent period directly correlated with GABA function was observed in clozapine-treated patients compared to other antipsychotics [<a href=""#B119-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B119-ijms-24-05945"">119</a>,<a href=""#B120-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B120-ijms-24-05945"">120</a>], suggesting clozapine’s ability to improve signal-to-noise discrimination [<a href=""#B121-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B121-ijms-24-05945"">121</a>], potentially through the potentiation of GABA<sub>B</sub>-mediated inhibitory transmission [<a href=""#B119-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B119-ijms-24-05945"">119</a>,<a href=""#B122-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B122-ijms-24-05945"">122</a>]. Through X-ray crystal structure analysis, a recent study demonstrated that clozapine binds directly to the GABA<sub>B</sub> similarly to baclofen, a GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor agonist proposed as a non-canonical antipsychotic [<a href=""#B122-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B122-ijms-24-05945"">122</a>]. Furthermore, a proton magnetic resonance imaging (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS) study measured GABA levels in the midcingulate cortex (MCC) of TRS patients, stratifying them into clozapine-resistant schizophrenia (CRS) and TRS patients. The results showed higher GABA levels in CRS compared to TRS patients suggesting the potential implication of GABA to clozapine resistance [<a href=""#B123-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B123-ijms-24-05945"">123</a>]. Conversely, a recent meta-analysis reported overall decreased GABA levels in the MCC of FEP patients compared to healthy control (HC) and elevated levels of glutamate and glutamate + glutamine (Glx, glutamate neurotransmitter and its precursor) in the same region of TRS patients suggesting a disruption of the excitatory/inhibitory balance in schizophrenia spectrum disorders [<a href=""#B124-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B124-ijms-24-05945"">124</a>]. Abnormalities in Glx levels have been associated with schizophrenia, possibly contributing to the dysfunction of glutamatergic neurotransmission [<a href=""#B125-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B125-ijms-24-05945"">125</a>,<a href=""#B126-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B126-ijms-24-05945"">126</a>]. Glutamate is released into the synaptic cleft and binds glutamate receptors at the PSD. Specifically, glutamate is subsequently removed by astrocytes and converted to glutamine by glutamine synthetase [<a href=""#B127-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B127-ijms-24-05945"">127</a>]. Then, glutamine can be internalized into the presynaptic terminal and converted to glutamate by phosphate-activated glutaminase [<a href=""#B128-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B128-ijms-24-05945"">128</a>,<a href=""#B129-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B129-ijms-24-05945"">129</a>]. Intriguingly, Madeira and collaborators suggested that circulating Glx levels exhibit a biphasic pattern in schizophrenia, with an increased glutamine/glutamate ratio at the onset and decreased levels with the progression of the disease [<a href=""#B130-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B130-ijms-24-05945"">130</a>]. α5-GABAARs have been measured in the hippocampus by means of PET [11C]Ro15-4513, showing lower levels in first-episode schizophrenia patients antipsychotics naïve compared to controls, while no differences are found in patients on antipsychotic treatment compared with controls [<a href=""#B131-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B131-ijms-24-05945"">131</a>]. Beyond some indirect effects of antipsychotics on GABA neurotransmission, there was a long-standing acknowledgement that antipsychotics do not act directly at GABAergic receptors. This view has been challenged recently by the observation that applying in vivo fiber photometry and chemogenetics antipsychotics (i.e., olanzapine and clozapine) may directly bind and work as antagonist GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in ventral tegmental area (VTA). As a consequence, GABA neurons are activated, and the GABAergic projection from VTA to the NAc is involved in such antipsychotic effects [<a href=""#B132-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B132-ijms-24-05945"">132</a>].</p>"
"<p>Alpha-adrenoceptor 1 (α<sub>1</sub>) and alpha-adrenoceptor 2 (α<sub>2</sub>) antagonism are both considered to be involved in modulating dopamine release in the PFC through firing dopaminergic neurons in the VTA [<a href=""#B133-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B133-ijms-24-05945"">133</a>], as demonstrated by the selective α<sub>1</sub> antagonist action of prazosin, which is responsible for enhancing the cognitive performance of MK-801 pretreated rats [<a href=""#B134-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B134-ijms-24-05945"">134</a>]. The available evidence indicates that blocking α<sub>1</sub> by antipsychotics may help to suppress positive symptoms, particularly in acute schizophrenia, whereas blocking α<sub>2</sub>, a prominent effect of clozapine and, to a lesser extent, risperidone, may instead help to partially relieve negative and cognitive symptoms. While α<sub>1</sub> blockade may inhibit striatal hyperdopaminergia at the presynaptic level, α<sub>2</sub> blockade may enhance and improve dopaminergic function in PFC [<a href=""#B133-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B133-ijms-24-05945"">133</a>]. In fact, non-selective α<sub>2</sub> blockage has been linked to the effects of atypical antipsychotics such as clozapine and antidepressants such as mirtazapine. It has been suggested that α<sub>2C</sub> and α<sub>2A</sub> heteroreceptors can regulate non-noradrenergic transmission, such as serotoninergic and dopaminergic, by sharing autoreceptor functions to inhibit noradrenaline release via negative feedback. In addition, while α<sub>2A</sub> seems to be highly distributed across the CNS, α<sub>2C</sub> expression is less abundant, suggesting the differential modulation of regional neurotransmission. α<sub>2C</sub> antagonism could be helpful during states of low endogenous noradrenergic activity, whereas α<sub>2A</sub> antagonism could be significant during states of high noradrenergic tone. Specifically, preclinical studies have shown that the antagonism at the α<sub>2C</sub> represents a non-canonical MOA for the regulation of GABA release in the striatum, inducing inhibition of GABA neurons projecting to cortical pyramidal neurons correlating with antidepressant/antipsychotic and procognitive-like effects [<a href=""#B135-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B135-ijms-24-05945"">135</a>,<a href=""#B136-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B136-ijms-24-05945"">136</a>]. In this context, α<sub>2C</sub> antagonists could unconventionally mitigate schizophrenia-associated symptoms [<a href=""#B136-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B136-ijms-24-05945"">136</a>], ameliorating cognitive deficits and PCP-induced social interaction impairment [<a href=""#B137-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B137-ijms-24-05945"">137</a>,<a href=""#B138-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B138-ijms-24-05945"">138</a>,<a href=""#B139-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B139-ijms-24-05945"">139</a>]. Furthermore, it has been proposed that clozapine MOA at the α<sub>1</sub> and α<sub>2</sub> receptors could globally stabilize dopaminergic transmission [<a href=""#B46-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B46-ijms-24-05945"">46</a>]. In fact, its α<sub>1</sub> antagonism could affect positive symptoms by attenuating limbic hyperdopaminergia, whereas α<sub>2</sub> blockade could act on negative symptoms by increasing prefrontal dopaminergic activity, both contributing to improving secondary negative symptoms [<a href=""#B140-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B140-ijms-24-05945"">140</a>].</p>"
"<p>Preclinical studies have shown that the antipsychotic effect of risperidone can be potentiated by additional treatment with an α<sub>2</sub> antagonist, idazoxan, resulting in the attenuation of EPS and the enhancement of cortical dopamine release and NMDAR-mediated responses [<a href=""#B141-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B141-ijms-24-05945"">141</a>] (<a href=""#ijms-24-05945-f003"" class=""usa-link"">Figure 3</a>). Consistent with these findings, the α<sub>2</sub> antagonism action of clozapine together with low D2R affinity could be considered a combined non-canonical MOA intercepting dopamine function and possibly relevant for its efficacy in TRS [<a href=""#B141-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B141-ijms-24-05945"">141</a>]. Moreover, the combination of idazoxan and raclopride, a selective D2R/D3R antagonist, was proposed to produce an atypical antipsychotic profile partially overlapping the clozapine MOA [<a href=""#B142-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B142-ijms-24-05945"">142</a>]. Nevertheless, the co-administration of raclopride and idazoxan was not able to reverse PPI deficit in rat animal model of schizophrenia, challenging the hypothesis that simple α<sub>2</sub>/D2R blockade may elicit atypical antipsychotic activity [<a href=""#B142-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B142-ijms-24-05945"">142</a>]. Another attempt to combine a D2R antagonism with adrenoreceptor α<sub>2</sub> antagonism was the combination/augmentation of idazoxan with haloperidol [<a href=""#B143-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B143-ijms-24-05945"">143</a>] or fluphenazine [<a href=""#B144-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B144-ijms-24-05945"">144</a>], yielding mixed results. Overall, the combined dopamine D2R and adrenoreceptor α<sub>2</sub> antagonism could be a non-canonical dopaminergic strategy worth further exploration.</p>"

Since M1 are critical for PFC acetylcholine functions [<a href=""#B151-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B151-ijms-24-05945"">151</a>], it has been suggested that the reversal of M1 expression could be a potential therapeutic target for antipsychotics, as demonstrated in a preclinical study using clozapine metabolite, N- desmethylclozapine, that exhibit an antagonism at M1 [<a href=""#B153-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B153-ijms-24-05945"">153</a>,<a href=""#B154-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B154-ijms-24-05945"">154</a>,<a href=""#B155-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B155-ijms-24-05945"">155</a>]. Preclinical studies hypothesized that positive allosteric modulation of M1 could enhance glutamatergic transmission mediated by the NMDAR in the hippocampus [<a href=""#B156-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B156-ijms-24-05945"">156</a>]. Moreover, the administration of selective M1 agonists showed to improve long-term depression (LTD), cognitive functions, and social skills in schizophrenia mouse models [<a href=""#B157-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B157-ijms-24-05945"">157</a>], providing new insights into synaptic alterations that may contribute to behavioral deficits and supporting M1’s role as an unconventional target for the treatment of schizophrenia. In contrast, the function of muscarinic receptor 3 (M3) has not been elucidated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia other than probably related to the adverse effects of antipsychotics, such as type 2 diabetes [<a href=""#B158-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B158-ijms-24-05945"">158</a>], considering that M3 mediates insulin release from pancreatic β cells directly through G<sub>q</sub> protein signaling [<a href=""#B159-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B159-ijms-24-05945"">159</a>] and indirectly through β-arrestin and polycystin 1 (PKD1) signaling [<a href=""#B158-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B158-ijms-24-05945"">158</a>]. Of interest, De Luca and collaborators have demonstrated that single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the muscarinic receptors 5 (<em>M5</em>) gene are associated with susceptibility to schizophrenia [<a href=""#B160-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B160-ijms-24-05945"">160</a>].

Indeed, M1–M4 agonism seems to be an interesting pharmacological mechanism for antipsychotics, as the dopamine-acetylcholine balance is relevant to decrease behavioral disturbances [<a href=""#B164-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B164-ijms-24-05945"">164</a>,<a href=""#B165-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B165-ijms-24-05945"">165</a>,<a href=""#B166-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B166-ijms-24-05945"">166</a>]. In this context, Shannon and coworkers demonstrated, in conditioned avoidance response, that muscarinic receptor agonists decreased the avoidance response in a manner similar to antipsychotics, suggesting that muscarinic receptor agonists may provide a non-canonical approach to the treatment of psychosis [<a href=""#B164-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B164-ijms-24-05945"">164</a>]. Thus, the muscarinic receptor agonist xanomeline demonstrated antipsychotic properties despite being devoid of a direct effect on D2R [<a href=""#B148-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B148-ijms-24-05945"">148</a>] but acting as a selective agonist of central muscarinic receptors M4 and M1 [<a href=""#B167-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B167-ijms-24-05945"">167</a>], proving significant efficacy in reducing positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS) total score with associated peripheral side effects [<a href=""#B152-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B152-ijms-24-05945"">152</a>,<a href=""#B168-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B168-ijms-24-05945"">168</a>,<a href=""#B169-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B169-ijms-24-05945"">169</a>]. Radioligand binding studies on cloned human receptors confirmed that xanomeline has a substantial affinity for muscarinic receptors [<a href=""#B167-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B167-ijms-24-05945"">167</a>], as well as for 5-HT<sub>1</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2</sub> receptor subtypes [<a href=""#B148-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B148-ijms-24-05945"">148</a>]. Watson and coworkers have shown xanomeline to be a potent agonist of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> and 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> receptors in native tissues and/or cloned cell lines and an antagonist of 5-HT<sub>2</sub> receptor subtypes [<a href=""#B167-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B167-ijms-24-05945"">167</a>], speculating potential antipsychotic activity related to action on these receptors. Despite the effect on M1 and M4 receptors is also shared by the atypical antipsychotic clozapine, Thomsen and coworkers inferred that the effects on PPI through both M1 and M4 in mice do not support the role of these receptors in mediating antipsychotic-like effects of clozapine [<a href=""#B166-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B166-ijms-24-05945"">166</a>]. The central and peripheral antimuscarinic affinity of antipsychotics is responsible for side effects, such as dizziness, drowsiness, confusion, blurred vision, and others [<a href=""#B170-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B170-ijms-24-05945"">170</a>,<a href=""#B171-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B171-ijms-24-05945"">171</a>]. The expedient for limiting peripheral cholinergic effects has been to co-administer xanomeline with trospium chloride, a peripheral muscarinic antagonist unable to cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB). Several muscarinic agonists have been shown to exert a functional antidopaminergic effect, particularly in the VTA, despite their lack of affinity for dopamine receptors [<a href=""#B172-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B172-ijms-24-05945"">172</a>].

"<p>Histamine has a remarkable role as a regulator of several neurotransmitters and critical brain functions [<a href=""#B186-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B186-ijms-24-05945"">186</a>]. Approximately 64,000 histaminergic neurons in the human brain have their soma in the tuberomamillary nucleus in the posterior hypothalamus and send their axons to several brain areas, including the thalamus, hippocampus, striatum, amygdala, and cortex [<a href=""#B186-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B186-ijms-24-05945"">186</a>]. Histamine acts through at least four G-protein-coupled receptors (H1–H4), of which H1, H2, and H3 receptors are expressed in the CNS [<a href=""#B187-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B187-ijms-24-05945"">187</a>]. However, clinical experimental data on the role of histamine in psychosis are scarce, whereas preclinical evidence is challenging. Animal studies have shed on the potential role of histamine system and traditional models of psychosis, as well as interactions between histaminergic drugs and antipsychotics. Indeed, following the stimulation of the D2R, methamphetamine has been shown to increase histamine levels in rat brains, suggesting that blockade of the H3 attenuates the effect of amphetamines on locomotion [<a href=""#B188-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B188-ijms-24-05945"">188</a>], an effect replicated in <em>HRH3</em> (<em>H3 receptor gene</em>)-KO mice that exhibited decreased spontaneous locomotion and poorly respond to methamphetamine [<a href=""#B189-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B189-ijms-24-05945"">189</a>].

"<p>Among non-canonical mechanisms intercepting dopaminergic signaling in treating schizophrenia, trace amines and their receptor have emerged strongly.

In order to be considered a multimodal therapeutic target for neuropsychiatric diseases, the role of TAAR1 as a critical node in the regulation of dopaminergic signaling has been established through a combination of experimental preclinical and translational studies [<a href=""#B212-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B212-ijms-24-05945"">212</a>] (<a href=""#ijms-24-05945-f003"" class=""usa-link"">Figure 3</a>).

SEP-363856, a novel therapy approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of schizophrenia, is a TAAR1 agonist in phase III clinical development. Since this compound modulates dopamine release without directly interacting with presynaptic and/or postsynaptic D2R, it may be able to treat TRS when other antipsychotics have failed and/or DSP has developed [<a href=""#B174-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B174-ijms-24-05945"">174</a>].

"<p>There is an emerging interest in dissecting non-canonical mechanisms that point to glutamate involvement as an antipsychotic augmentation strategy.

It is possible that the use of additional glutamatergic agents in patients receiving clozapine may have little effect, possibly due to a putative ceiling effect on the NMDAR transmission enhancement already exerted by clozapine [<a href=""#B221-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B221-ijms-24-05945"">221</a>]. Strategies based on the potentiation of glutamatergic signaling by glycinergic agents (e.g., glycine and D-serine), glycine transporter 1 (GlyT1) inhibitors (e.g., bitopertin and BI 425809), and other glutamate allosteric NMDAR modulators (e.g., CNS4) have been tested. D-serine has been assessed in several RCTs in augmentation to clozapine or other antipsychotics, showing poor beneficial effects among patients treated with clozapine, whereas a meta-analytic study indicated that adjunctive treatment with D-serine and glycine was effective with other antipsychotics in improving the negative symptoms of schizophrenia [<a href=""#B222-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B222-ijms-24-05945"">222</a>] (<a href=""#ijms-24-05945-f003"" class=""usa-link"">Figure 3</a>).

Penfluridol has been explored for the inhibition of cancer metastasis through the action of integrin expression responsible for the suppression of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition factors, vimentin, and zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 [<a href=""#B534-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B534-ijms-24-05945"">534</a>]. The decrease in the levels of integrin α6 and urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor in glioma cells induced by penfluridol via focal adhesion kinase, paxillin, RAC, and Rho-associated coiled-coil containing kinases proteins activation was found reducing cancer cell migration and invasion [<a href=""#B534-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B534-ijms-24-05945"">534</a>]. These antiproliferative effects could also be mediated by suppressing cancer growth via the AKT-dependent inhibition of the transcription factor <em>glioma-associated oncogene 1</em> [<a href=""#B534-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B534-ijms-24-05945"">534</a>]. Trifluoperazine acts as a calmodulin antagonist; its involvement in calcium homeostasis has been reported in liver and breast cancer therapy based on the elevated levels of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and calmodulin typical of these cancers’ cell types, which are associated with increased DNA synthesis and cell proliferation. This drug is found to bind the IP3 (inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate) receptor, promoting Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the endoplasmic reticulum and subsequent cell death [<a href=""#B535-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B535-ijms-24-05945"">535</a>] and acting as a calmodulin antagonist. It prevents calmodulin–isocitrate dehydrogenase binding that is relevant for the survival and migration of glioblastoma multiforme cells [<a href=""#B535-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B535-ijms-24-05945"">535</a>]. Finally, trifluoperazine enhanced the effects of doxorubicin on glioma cell growth by increasing the expression of the nuclear tumor suppressor Forkhead box O1 and reducing the levels of multidrug resistance genes [<a href=""#B536-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B536-ijms-24-05945"">536</a>]. Another example of drug repositioning is represented by pimozide, which through its effect as an antagonist at D2R, D3R, and D4R, has been used to explore the potential anti-metastatic activity in murine melanoma [<a href=""#B537-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B537-ijms-24-05945"">537</a>]. The epidermal growth factors epiregulin, epigen, and NRG1 are discovered to be downregulated as a result of pimozide’s inhibition of the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)5 in breast cancer cells [<a href=""#B538-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B538-ijms-24-05945"">538</a>]. Instead, by targeting the STAT3 signaling pathway, pimozide was found to inhibit proliferation and promote apoptosis in prostate cancer cells [<a href=""#B539-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B539-ijms-24-05945"">539</a>]. Finally, this drug may weaken the self-renewal and survival of glioblastoma multiforme, inhibit myelin-related infiltration, and increase sensitivity to radiotherapy by acting on the ubiquitin-specific peptidase 1-inhibitor of DNA binding proteins-Nogo ligand1 signaling axis [<a href=""#B540-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B540-ijms-24-05945"">540</a>,<a href=""#B541-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B541-ijms-24-05945"">541</a>]. Olanzapine has been reported to have an antiproliferative action and can inhibit glioblastoma cell proliferation, migration, and anchorage-independent growth. Furthermore, it might induce autophagic cell death through the suppression of NF-κB activation [<a href=""#B542-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B542-ijms-24-05945"">542</a>] and disrupt cholesterol homeostasis, resulting in cell death [<a href=""#B543-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B543-ijms-24-05945"">543</a>]. Risperidone induces a reduction in PC3 prostate cancer cell proliferation rate in adenocarcinoma [<a href=""#B544-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B544-ijms-24-05945"">544</a>].

"<p>Although all antipsychotics share the common feature represented by D2R occupancy, which is considered the major mechanism of the “anti-psychotic” effect, in recent years, other cellular mechanisms based on dopaminergic function, its modulation, and non-canonical type have emerged [<a href=""#B46-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B46-ijms-24-05945"">46</a>,<a href=""#B67-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B67-ijms-24-05945"">67</a>,<a href=""#B174-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B174-ijms-24-05945"">174</a>,<a href=""#B349-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B349-ijms-24-05945"">349</a>,<a href=""#B561-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B561-ijms-24-05945"">561</a>,<a href=""#B562-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B562-ijms-24-05945"">562</a>]. Greater precision in defining the molecular and structural nature of dopamine receptors’ interaction with the antipsychotic molecules (e.g., the atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of typical and atypical antipsychotics and the cryoelectronic microscopy structures of D1R-G<sub>s</sub> and D2R-G<sub>i</sub> signaling complexes) has also open new avenues to understanding the “dopaminergic side” of antipsychotic action allowing [<a href=""#B563-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B563-ijms-24-05945"">563</a>,<a href=""#B564-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B564-ijms-24-05945"">564</a>]. The discovery of different dopaminergic mechanisms at D2R has opened new scenarios of the pharmacological mechanisms, possibly for patients who do not respond or respond poorly to antipsychotics. A relevant change in the canonical conceptualization of dopamine dynamics under antipsychotic exposure is the appreciation of novel presynaptic mechanisms related to dopamine release regulation that is believed to be the major pathogenetic underpinning responsible for hyperdopaminergia in schizophrenia [<a href=""#B565-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B565-ijms-24-05945"">565</a>]. One of these presynaptic mechanisms is the accumulation of the antipsychotic drug in synaptic vesicles with the endogenous dopamine and its subsequent release upon neuronal activation in extracellular space where the antipsychotic inhibits VGSCs and vesicular exocytosis [<a href=""#B78-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B78-ijms-24-05945"">78</a>,<a href=""#B79-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B79-ijms-24-05945"">79</a>]. It has been reported that haloperidol may enhance the activity of VGSCs in cortical neurons in cortical slices after chronic exposure [<a href=""#B566-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B566-ijms-24-05945"">566</a>], whereas acute haloperidol treatment may induce channel inhibition [<a href=""#B567-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B567-ijms-24-05945"">567</a>]. It has been suggested that this action upon VGSCs may contribute to time-dependent both therapeutic effects and side effects of haloperidol. A significant effect on VGSCs is also reported for the bias-ligand aripiprazole [<a href=""#B568-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B568-ijms-24-05945"">568</a>]. Concerning the dopaminergic presynaptic mechanism, DAT has also been implicated for its potential involvement in antipsychotics’ response despite the fact that its role in schizophrenia pathophysiology is still elusive partly due to methodological limitations both at clinical and preclinical levels [<a href=""#B5-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B5-ijms-24-05945"">5</a>,<a href=""#B569-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B569-ijms-24-05945"">569</a>,<a href=""#B570-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B570-ijms-24-05945"">570</a>,<a href=""#B571-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B571-ijms-24-05945"">571</a>]. Beyond intracellular dopamine D2-directly mediated signaling, dopamine-dependent trans-synaptic mechanisms have emerged, unveiling antipsychotics’ impact on the expression and functions of molecules belonging to different neurotransmitter systems. Among the trans-synaptic effects of antipsychotics, the modulation of the gene expression of glutamatergic PSD proteins has attracted attention for the potential relevance of directly sculpting the synapse architecture based on the pivotal role of PSD proteins in shaping the dendritic spine. It has been demonstrated that PSD proteins, such as PSD-95, Homer, and Shank, are involved in schizophrenia pathophysiology and that their gene expression is modulated by antipsychotics based on the D2R affinity, dose, and duration of treatment, whereas the specific receptor profile beyond dopamine D2R antagonism may further contribute to modulate the pattern of gene expression changes [<a href=""#B349-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B349-ijms-24-05945"">349</a>]. A critical appraisal of the findings reported in the present systematic review should also consider some limitations and open questions. First, when considering canonical and non-canonical mechanisms of antipsychotics focusing on dopamine, it is probably a reductionistic approach for drugs that have a complex receptor profile. Despite the significant role of other neurotransmitter systems, above all, the glutamatergic [<a href=""#B572-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B572-ijms-24-05945"">572</a>,<a href=""#B573-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B573-ijms-24-05945"">573</a>], GABAergic [<a href=""#B574-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B574-ijms-24-05945"">574</a>], and serotoninergic [<a href=""#B82-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B82-ijms-24-05945"">82</a>] ones; dopamine remains a pivotal target for schizophrenia treatment [<a href=""#B575-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B575-ijms-24-05945"">575</a>,<a href=""#B576-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B576-ijms-24-05945"">576</a>]. Furthermore, the search for dopamine-based non-canonical mechanisms is particularly timing considering the emerging novel concepts on dopamine molecular anatomy [<a href=""#B577-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B577-ijms-24-05945"">577</a>] and physiology relevant for the pathophysiology and clinics of salience and cognition mechanisms [<a href=""#B578-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B578-ijms-24-05945"">578</a>], possibly involved in the clinical manifestations of schizophrenia, especially in terms of abnormal cortical-subcortical connectivity [<a href=""#B579-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B579-ijms-24-05945"">579</a>]. Among these new findings, the repurposing of dopaminergic functional anatomy beyond the classical pathways has been noted [<a href=""#B580-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B580-ijms-24-05945"">580</a>] and the demonstration of the involvement of nigrostriatal pathways not only in positive symptoms, as already known, but also in cognitive and negative symptoms of psychosis in a more direct way than previously thought [<a href=""#B581-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B581-ijms-24-05945"">581</a>]. </p>"
"<p>Second, it could be questioned if and how non-canonical mechanisms can be pragmatically tackled for the development of novel therapeutic strategies that are needed for those conditions, such as TRS, that do not respond or respond poorly to the available antipsychotics. In this regard and concerning presynaptic dopamine regulation, at least two compounds are in an advanced phase of clinical development represented by TAAR1 agonist [<a href=""#B174-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B174-ijms-24-05945"">174</a>,<a href=""#B582-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B582-ijms-24-05945"">582</a>,<a href=""#B583-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B583-ijms-24-05945"">583</a>,<a href=""#B584-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B584-ijms-24-05945"">584</a>,<a href=""#B585-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B585-ijms-24-05945"">585</a>] and xanomeline + trospium [<a href=""#B168-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B168-ijms-24-05945"">168</a>,<a href=""#B169-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B169-ijms-24-05945"">169</a>,<a href=""#B585-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B585-ijms-24-05945"">585</a>,<a href=""#B586-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B586-ijms-24-05945"">586</a>], both involved in the regulation of dopamine release, though not through a primary dopamine-dependent receptor mechanism. Furthermore, regarding the modulation of synaptic proteins that are a significant non-canonical dopamine-dependent effect of antipsychotics, it should be acknowledged that despite the technical difficulties, there is a growing interest in the possibility of interfering with the PSD proteins’ function. A relevant example is represented by PSD-95 inhibition by <em>N</em>PEG4(IETDV)2 (Tat-<em>N</em>-dimer), which binds the tandem PDZ1-2 domain of PSD-95 with a high affinity of 4.6 nM [<a href=""#B587-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B587-ijms-24-05945"">587</a>,<a href=""#B588-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B588-ijms-24-05945"">588</a>] in the same line of research is the development of the small molecules ZL006 and IC87201 as potential inhibitors of nNOS-PDZ/PSD95-PDZ interactions [<a href=""#B589-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B589-ijms-24-05945"">589</a>].</p>"
"<p>Third, an open question of clinical relevance is to what extent novel mechanisms based on non-canonical dopamine-related MOA can be “game-changing” in those difficult-to-treat conditions such as TRS. At present, the xanomelin + trospium combination is under scrutiny in a clinical trial specifically designed for subjects with schizophrenia with an inadequate response to their current antipsychotic treatment [<a href=""#B590-ijms-24-05945"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""B590-ijms-24-05945"">590</a>], and any prediction should be held until the final results are publicly available. With caution, it is conceivable that regulating dopamine release with a non-primary dopamine mechanism could be efficacious for those cases of resistance that emerged after a period of a successful response to antipsychotics’ treatment and believed to be linked, possibly, to the upregulation of D2R (increased B<sub>max</sub>) and/or D2R high affinity increased number.</p>"
"<p>Antipsychotics’ dopamine-based non-canonical mechanisms should be exploited (i) for a better understanding of the complex cellular dynamics of antipsychotics beyond D2R occupancy-driven signaling (i.e., cAMP, β-arrestin/AKT and Phospholipase A); (ii) to overcome the limitations, in terms of both efficacy and adverse events of the available compounds. This could allow the exploration of new molecular avenues within the dopamine system, which remains, directly or indirectly, a fundamental pharmacological target in schizophrenia treatment.</p>"

"<p id=""P4"">The search for robust, reliable biomarkers of schizophrenia remains a high priority in psychiatry. Biomarkers are valuable because they can reveal the underlying mechanisms of symptoms and monitor treatment progress and may predict future risk of developing schizophrenia. Despite the existence of various promising biomarkers that relate to symptoms across the schizophrenia spectrum, and despite published recommendations encouraging multivariate metrics, they are rarely investigated simultaneously within the same individuals. In those with schizophrenia, the magnitude of purported biomarkers is complicated by comorbid diagnoses, medications and other treatments. Here, we argue three points. First, we reiterate the importance of assessing multiple biomarkers simultaneously. Second, we argue that investigating biomarkers in those with schizophrenia-related traits (schizotypy) in the general population can accelerate progress in understanding the mechanisms of schizophrenia. We focus on biomarkers of sensory and working memory in schizophrenia and their smaller effects in individuals with <em>nonclinical</em> schizotypy. Third, we note irregularities across research domains leading to the current situation in which there is a preponderance of data on auditory sensory memory and visual working memory, but markedly less in visual (iconic) memory and auditory working memory, particularly when focusing on schizotypy where data are either scarce or inconsistent. Together, this review highlights opportunities for researchers without access to clinical populations to address gaps in knowledge. We conclude by highlighting the theory that early sensory memory deficits contribute negatively to working memory and vice versa. This presents a mechanistic perspective where biomarkers may interact with one another and impact schizophrenia-related symptoms.</p>"

"<p id=""P5"">Schizophrenia and schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD) remain a prominent public health risk. There are persistent gaps in knowledge surrounding the biological mechanisms of symptoms affecting cognition, behaviour and emotion. To track the emergence and progression of symptoms, there is a need for reliable biomarkers of schizophrenia and SSD. These biomarkers can reveal underlying mechanisms as well as complement existing clinical interviewing methods. Biomarkers may also be used to predict conversion from high risk to diagnosis (<a href=""#R126"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R126"">Naatanen et al., 2016</a>). Currently, there is no gold standard biomarker that reliably tracks symptom severity (<a href=""#R101"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R101"">Lieberman et al., 2019</a>), although there is convergence regarding risk factors and cognitive deficits (<a href=""#R119"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R119"">Mohn-Haugen et al., 2022</a>). This has led to many calls for multivariate biomarker metrics to more comprehensively assess an individual’s risk level (e.g., (<a href=""#R12"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R12"">Cannon et al., 2016</a>; <a href=""#R138"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R138"">Price et al., 2006</a>; <a href=""#R161"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R161"">Seidman, Shapiro, et al., 2016</a>). Although this opinion is not controversial, there remains a tendency to focus on single biomarkers and their predictive power. This may be due to the simplicity of understanding how a single biomarker reflects underlying processing schizophrenia and SSD and to the added technical difficulties and financial challenges involved when measuring multiple biomarkers. Here, we support the call for a multivariate biomarker, and we extend this view by suggesting that to accelerate our understanding of the neural mechanisms associated with symptoms, it would be valuable to test across the entire SSD, including neurotypical individuals with <em>high subclinical schizotypy</em> symptomatology in the general population. This suggestion has the added benefit of increasing the pool of researchers available to investigate questions of clinical relevance, but who do not have access to clinical populations.</p>"
"<p id=""P6"">Here, we define <em>schizotypy</em> as the subclinical characteristics associated with schizophrenia that are prevalent within the general population. Schizotypy in this context is not a diagnosis as the schizophrenia-related traits are not severe enough to warrant intervention. It is unknown if participants with high schizotypy traits will develop schizophrenia and/or psychosis in the future, as many of these studies are cross-sectional in design and recruit from the general population. However, one value of focusing on schizotypy is that participants with psychiatric or neurological diagnosis can be removed. This reduces the likelihood of comorbid conditions and medications that may confound the findings. Therefore, it would be expeditious to include a larger swath of the spectrum to include the larger <em>subclinical</em> population and to combine discrete biomarkers that track symptom severity.</p>"
"<p id=""P7"">Existing biomarkers include genetic polymorphisms (<a href=""#R36"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R36"">Ettinger et al., 2014</a>), oculomotor abnormalities (reviewed in <a href=""#R99"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R99"">Levy et al., 2010</a>) and atypical neural responses detected using electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Unfortunately, many of these biomarkers were identified in isolation rather than in tandem with other biomarkers associated with a particular sensory or cognitive domain. This is despite success when taking a multifactorial approach to monitoring multiple neural (<a href=""#R82"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R82"">Kent et al., 2004</a>; <a href=""#R138"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R138"">Price et al., 2006</a>; <a href=""#R142"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R142"">Ranlund et al., 2018</a>; <a href=""#R175"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R175"">Taylor et al., 2017</a>) and behavioural (<a href=""#R161"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R161"">Seidman, Shapiro, et al., 2016</a>) measures to help distinguish between schizophrenia and other psychosis-related conditions such as bipolar disorder. Because of the success seen in those diagnosed with schizophrenia, we recommend the same multifactorial approach for the subclinical schizotypy population. For the current review, we revisit EEG biomarkers from several related literatures: abnormal <em>sensory</em> memory (SM) and <em>working</em> memory (WM), in both auditory and visual modalities. These topics have well-developed literatures with a substantial foundation in the clinical schizophrenia and SSD populations. We focused on sensory and WM specifically to explore how these biomarkers may interact due to downstream deficits impacting later processing. We discuss the use of sensory and WM measures as biomarkers of symptom severity from a cross-sectional perspective—How do these markers reflect on their internal processes at this moment? We conclude by discussing how some of the biomarkers we discuss may be promising as predictive biomarkers of the onset of psychosis and schizophrenia and briefly summarize some of the literature up to this point.</p>"

If <em>sensory</em> encoding is impaired, then the information derived from the impoverished signal will produce further problems. An immediate consequence of impaired SM is reduced information available for WM. In addition, WM deficits in schizophrenia could negatively impact SM too: If WM is inefficient, then manipulating incoming sensory information will also be impaired. Improvements anywhere along this loop could have cascading consequences (<a href=""#F1"" class=""usa-link"">Figure 1</a>).

"<p id=""P9"">Because psychiatric populations are difficult to access, recruit and retain in research studies, we must leverage all data points including findings from the subclinical population. We subscribe to the view that the general population falls along a spectrum of schizotypal symptoms (theoretical review in <a href=""#R51"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R51"">Grant et al., 2018</a>; see <a href=""#F2"" class=""usa-link"">Figure 2</a> for illustration). People with more symptoms, but within neurotypical range, are referred to as having ‘high schizotypy’. First-degree relatives of those with schizophrenia typically have high schizotypy ratings and are considered to be at high clinical risk (<a href=""#R77"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R77"">Kalmady et al., 2020</a>; <a href=""#R94"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R94"">Le et al., 2020</a>).

An important challenge in <em>subclinical</em> populations is that any biomarker would be weaker. We began our review by searching specific sensory and WM terms in PubMed and counting the number of studies identified; see <a href=""#T1"" class=""usa-link"">Table 1</a>.

"<p id=""P10"">SM refers to the window over which the neural response to a sensory stimulus remains active after the stimulus is withdrawn. The duration of the memory trace is brief (e.g., (<a href=""#R171"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R171"">Sperling, 1960</a>) and considered to be preattentive (<a href=""#R125"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R125"">Naatanen et al., 1982</a>). Measures of SM are appealing as a clinical biomarker because they are unaffected by attentional focus—which is compromised in schizophrenia. The SM trace is an input for predictive coding and is very sensitive to changes in sensory stimuli (<a href=""#R188"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R188"">Winkler, 2007</a>; <a href=""#R189"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R189"">Winkler et al., 2009</a>). It is also extremely adaptive to the current environment (<a href=""#R109"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R109"">May &amp; Tiitinen, 2007</a>, <a href=""#R108"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R108"">2010</a>). Abnormal SM in those with schizophrenia <em>may</em> be domain general (<a href=""#R127"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R127"">Neuhaus et al., 2013</a>; <a href=""#R149"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R149"">Saint-Amour et al., 2007</a>). To date, the most research has been conducted in audition and vision, although SM in the somatosensory and olfactory domains is reduced in schizophrenia (somatosensory [<a href=""#R104"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R104"">Ludwig et al., 2016</a>; <a href=""#R57"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R57"">Haigh et al., 2016</a>]; olfactory [<a href=""#R118"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R118"">Moberg et al., 2003</a>; <a href=""#R191"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R191"">Wu et al., 1993</a>]) and can be tracked using similar methods to vision and audition (<a href=""#R145"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R145"">Restuccia et al., 2009</a>). Despite the numerous reports of oculomotor dysfunction in schizophrenia and SSD, relatively little has been reported in visual SM. We will now discuss each in turn.</p>"
"<p id=""P11"">Poor auditory SM impairs the encoding of simple parameters of sounds. Neural measures of <em>auditory</em> SM are a clinically useful biomarker. They are minimally affected by attention and can be measured before the participant is aware of the percept, thereby isolating early sensory processing from upstream cognitive processes.</p>"
"<p id=""P12"">In people with schizophrenia, there are numerous examples of deficits in auditory SM, including impaired pitch discrimination (distinguishing between tones of different pitches [<a href=""#R113"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R113"">McLachlan et al., 2013</a>]; tone-pair matching [<a href=""#R140"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R140"">Rabinowicz et al., 2000</a>]; sound localization [<a href=""#R29"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R29"">Donde et al., 2020</a>; <a href=""#R30"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R30"">Donde, Martinez, et al., 2019</a>]; discrimination of intensity, duration and sequences [<a href=""#R156"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R156"">Schnakenberg Martin et al., 2018</a>]; and auditory scene segregation [<a href=""#R141"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R141"">Ramage et al., 2012</a>; <a href=""#R185"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R185"">Weintraub et al., 2012</a>]). Moreover, there is evidence that mismatch negativity (MMN) amplitude is lower in those with schizophrenia, reflective of a general auditory SM deficit (<a href=""#R14"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R14"">Catts et al., 1995</a>), lower educational achievement before the onset of schizophrenia, worse cognitive symptoms, poorer global function and longer duration of illness (<a href=""#R44"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R44"">Friedman et al., 2012</a>). There is some question over whether these abnormal auditory responses are due to SM or if they are due to problems encoding the information in the first place. Although it is difficult to disentangle how poor early encoding impacts the ability to encode short-term memory traces, there is evidence that both individuals with chronic schizophrenia and individuals at their first episode of psychosis show deficits in encoding deviants in complex patterns (<a href=""#R57"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R57"">Haigh et al., 2016</a>; <a href=""#R58"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R58"">Haigh, Coffman, &amp; Salisbury, 2017</a>; <a href=""#R153"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R153"">Salisbury et al., 2018</a>), suggesting that memory impairments persist after encoding. However, other aspects of audition are preserved, including the time course of auditory SM (<a href=""#R106"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R106"">March et al., 1999</a>) and the ability to categorize syllables (<a href=""#R23"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R23"">Dale et al., 2010</a>; <a href=""#R56"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R56"">Haigh et al., 2019</a>). Categorization can also show the expected shifts when participants are habituated to one syllable (e.g., adapting to one syllable category makes it easier to detect a syllable in another category) (<a href=""#R56"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R56"">Haigh et al., 2019</a>) suggesting residual plasticity in the auditory system. Finally, more closely associated with specific symptoms of schizophrenia, auditory hallucinators reporting phenomenon of speech and voices exhibit worse auditory SM (<a href=""#R112"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R112"">McCleery et al., 2018</a>), highlighting the link between auditory processing and symptomology.</p>"
"<p id=""P13"">There is evidence of similar, but smaller, SM abnormalities in schizotypy that are similar to those reported in schizophrenia. However, the number of studies focusing on schizotypy is relatively small and often identifies potential biomarkers in isolation. For example, sensory cortices send a ‘corollary discharge’ indicating a selfgenerated response compared with external in origin (<a href=""#R172"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R172"">Sperry, 1950</a>). Auditory corollary discharges are produced in the superior temporal gyri (<a href=""#R20"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R20"">Creutzfeldt et al., 1989</a>; <a href=""#R121"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R121"">Muller-Preuss &amp; Ploog, 1981</a>) and are manifest by reduced auditory N1 ERP responses to <em>self-generated</em> speech compared with the N1 response to externally generated speech (<a href=""#R42"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R42"">Ford &amp; Mathalon, 2005</a>). Individuals with schizophrenia show equivalent N1 amplitudes for self-generated and externally generated speech, suggesting they cannot differentiate between conditions. Impaired corollary discharge could reflect a confusion between self-generated auditory hallucinations and externally generated speech (<a href=""#R42"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R42"">Ford &amp; Mathalon, 2005</a>). In schizophrenia, there is a reliable reduction in N1 amplitude (<a href=""#R150"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R150"">Salisbury, 2010</a>; <a href=""#R164"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R164"">Shelley et al., 1999</a>); reviewed in <a href=""#R147"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R147"">Rosburg et al., 2008</a>) that correlate with the perceptual deficit (<a href=""#R74"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R74"">Javitt et al., 2000</a>). Similarly, individuals with high schizotypy show equally large N1 responses to external and self-generated speech, whereas neurotypical participants with low schizotypy show N1 suppression to self-generated speech (<a href=""#R130"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R130"">Oestreich et al., 2016</a>). Those high in schizotypy show reduced precision in auditory SM despite normal rates of acquisition and decay (<a href=""#R6"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R6"">Bates, 2005</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P14"">In addition, reductions in well-characterized cognitive-related ERPs in combination with sensory ERPs to simple auditory stimuli have shown some utility. For example, reductions in the P3 complex (<a href=""#R73"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R73"">Javitt et al., 1995</a>; <a href=""#R139"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R139"">Pritchard et al., 1985</a>) are evident early in the disease course (<a href=""#R25"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R25"">Devrim-Ucok et al., 2016</a>; <a href=""#R151"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R151"">Salisbury et al., 2020</a>), as are reductions in steady-state potentials (<a href=""#R103"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R103"">Light et al., 2006</a>), and in the slow-wave potentials associated with auditory scene segmentation (<a href=""#R19"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R19"">Coffman et al., 2017</a>, <a href=""#R18"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R18"">2018</a>) that correlate with hypoactive midcingulate cortex (<a href=""#R18"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R18"">Coffman et al., 2018</a>). Reduced amplitude of P50, MMN, P3 and antisaccades (making eye movements in the opposite direction to a cue) are reported in individuals with schizophrenia, and significant reductions in P50 and P3 in relatives, compared with controls. However, combining all four measures in a multivariate analysis permitted the model to accurately (80%) classify group assignment (<a href=""#R138"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R138"">Price et al., 2006</a>). In short, throughout early auditory sensory processing, there are atypical event-related potentials (ERPs) in the schizophrenia population. Further investigation in high schizotypy individuals to expressly investigate auditory SM would be valuable to understand the boundary conditions between intact and impaired function in SSD.</p>"
"<p id=""P15"">The most robust neural measure of SM is the MMN. In neurotypical individuals, fronto-central electrodes record larger (more negative) responses to an infrequent deviant stimulus than to the standard stimulus at around 100–200 ms after stimulus onset (<a href=""#R123"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R123"">Naatanen, 1985</a>). The MMN is calculated by subtracting the EEG response to the standard tone from response to the deviant tone producing a different waveform (<a href=""#R125"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R125"">Naatanen et al., 1982</a>). In individuals with chronic schizophrenia, the MMN is <em>smaller</em> (Cohen’s <em>d</em>: 0.99) (<a href=""#R75"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R75"">Javitt &amp; Sweet, 2015</a>; <a href=""#R179"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R179"">Umbricht &amp; Krljes, 2005</a>), and magnetic activity in the planum temporale (secondary auditory cortex) is reduced during auditory SM tasks that generated a smaller (magnetic) MMN (<a href=""#R86"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R86"">Kircher et al., 2004</a>). Reduced MMN generalizes across stimuli (<a href=""#R34"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R34"">Erickson et al., 2016</a>; <a href=""#R179"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R179"">Umbricht &amp; Krljes, 2005</a>) and includes responses to pattern deviants based on grouping (<a href=""#R57"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R57"">Haigh et al., 2016</a>), pitch (<a href=""#R59"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R59"">Haigh, Matteis, et al., 2017</a>), rules (<a href=""#R56"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R56"">Haigh et al., 2019</a>) and phonemes (<a href=""#R40"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R40"">Fisher et al., 2019</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P16"">In SSD, the degree of MMN reduction correlates with symptom severity (<a href=""#R40"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R40"">Fisher et al., 2019</a>; <a href=""#R102"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R102"">Light &amp; Braff, 2005</a>). Greater reductions are apparent in chronic schizophrenia compared with individuals at high risk (<a href=""#R165"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R165"">Shin et al., 2012</a>). Local and global change detection have both been found to be poor in schizophrenia suggesting evidence of abnormal predictive coding that cannot be due to abnormal adaptation to simple stimulus parameters (<a href=""#R87"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R87"">Kirihara et al., 2020</a>). Together, these data highlight a pervasive deficit in preconscious auditory SM that occurs early in the auditory processing stream (<a href=""#R35"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R35"">Escera &amp; Malmierca, 2014</a>). MMN is sensitive to the balance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters in the auditory cortex (<a href=""#R66"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R66"">Holliday et al., 2018</a>). There is some debate regarding neurotransmitter systems’ roles in the auditory MMN. Some evidence indicates a restored MMN with nicotinic agonists, implicating acetylcholinergic modulation (<a href=""#R2"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R2"">Baldeweg et al., 2006</a>; but see <a href=""#R89"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R89"">Knott et al., 2014</a>), whereas other studies implicate acetylcholinergic (<a href=""#R78"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R78"">Kantrowitz et al., 2018</a>) or serotonergic influence (<a href=""#R159"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R159"">Sehatpour et al., 2022</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P17"">In SSD, more broadly, there is some evidence of reduced MMN. For example, MMN to pitch oddballs successfully discriminates between neurotypicals and people diagnosed with schizotypal personality disorder (<a href=""#R128"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R128"">Niznikiewicz et al., 2009</a>). Furthermore, combining MMN responses to multiple deviants (duration, gap or silence instead of a tone, or location of tone) leads to identification accuracy of up to 80.5% when using multivariate machine learning techniques. The combined MMN accuracy correlated with global assessment of functioning, highlighting auditory MMN as a biomarker of symptoms in chronic schizophrenia (<a href=""#R175"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R175"">Taylor et al., 2017</a>). MMN deficits are evident in early course schizophrenia (within 2 years of the first episode of psychosis; <a href=""#R152"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R152"">Salisbury et al., 2007</a>). There are inconsistent findings in those within 6 months of initial psychosis (<a href=""#R34"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R34"">Erickson et al., 2016</a>; <a href=""#R57"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R57"">Haigh et al., 2016</a>) and in those at risk of developing schizophrenia (compare <a href=""#R165"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R165"">Shin et al., 2012</a>, with <a href=""#R68"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R68"">Hsieh et al., 2019</a>), or who are unaffected first-degree relatives (<a href=""#R105"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R105"">Magno et al., 2008</a>). Several accounts address why MMN deficits are greater in those with advanced disease. One theory is that MMN is tied to symptom severity (<a href=""#R78"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R78"">Kantrowitz et al., 2018</a>), as MMN correlates with negative symptoms in chronic (&gt;5 years) patients (<a href=""#R14"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R14"">Catts et al., 1995</a>). Of relevance, the MMN correlates with negative symptoms in <em>first</em>-episode patients and with measures of social functioning (<a href=""#R122"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R122"">Murphy et al., 2020</a>). Certainly, individuals with chronic schizophrenia have the most severe symptoms and neurological consequences. For example, MMN correlates with reduced grey matter volume in primary auditory cortex, and both MMN deficits and the great matter volume reductions increase with the duration of time past first episode (<a href=""#R152"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R152"">Salisbury et al., 2007</a>, <a href=""#R151"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R151"">2020</a>). A recent meta-analysis indicated that MMN shows a progressively greater abnormality, with first-degree relatives showing the smallest deficit, followed by individuals at high risk of developing schizophrenia, and finally recently diagnosed (early-stage schizophrenia), compared with those with chronic schizophrenia (<a href=""#R34"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R34"">Erickson et al., 2016</a>) <a href=""#F3"" class=""usa-link"">Figure 3</a>).</p>"

"<p id=""P18"">A few inconsistent MMN findings are worth mentioning. First, some people ‘recover’ without repeated psychotic episodes, and they do not exhibit an abnormal MMN (<a href=""#R84"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R84"">Kim et al., 2020</a>). This highlights a key gap—Few longitudinal studies have been conducted to ascertain how biomarkers change over time or with vacillating symptoms. Second, a small study in the subclinical population reported that high scorers on the suspiciousness subscale had <em>larger</em> MMN amplitudes than low scorers (<a href=""#R11"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R11"">Broyd et al., 2016</a>). Thus, the current literature presents competing perspectives: (1) that increased symptom load reliably predicts abnormal MMN (e.g., <a href=""#R17"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R17"">Claridge &amp; Beech, 1995</a>), but (2) in the subclinical population, more subtle patterns of preserved and impaired MMN emerge. Clearly, more research is needed to address these gaps in our understanding.</p>"
"<p id=""P19"">Despite the wealth of data cataloguing impaired auditory SM in schizophrenia and SSD, there is relatively little in the visual SM domain. This is surprising given the prevalence of oculomotor deficits in schizophrenia, suggesting that the visual system is affected. Before describing the studies that have reported on visual SM, we note research pinpointing oculomotor deficits in SSD. We address this issue first because oculomotor deficits lead to atypical sampling of the environment and these contribute to abnormal visual sensation. Oculomotor responses are disrupted along SSD with atypical performance in saccadic tasks (e.g., double-step, adaptation and anti-saccade) and smooth pursuit (<a href=""#R129"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R129"">O’Driscoll &amp; Callahan, 2008</a>; <a href=""#R177"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R177"">Thakkar &amp; Rolfs, 2019</a>; <a href=""#R190"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R190"">Wolf et al., 2021</a>). A proposed mechanism is that abnormal corollary discharge (e.g., <a href=""#R38"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R38"">Feinberg, 1978</a>) disrupts knowledge about eye position, resulting in inaccurate eye movements with more interruptions during visual tracking. Findings in nonhuman primates and lesion studies implicate impaired signalling in the medio-dorsal thalamus, which serves as an intermediary between subcortical eye movement control areas (e.g., superior colliculus) and frontal eye fields (<a href=""#R177"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R177"">Thakkar &amp; Rolfs, 2019</a>). Inactivating this pathway creates a mismatch between where organisms believe their eyes are directed and where they are actually looking and thus alters visual perception (<a href=""#R15"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R15"">Cavanaugh et al., 2016</a>). In those with schizophrenia, the abnormal visual scan patterns of faces and social settings contribute to aberrant social interactions (<a href=""#R135"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R135"">Patel et al., 2020</a>). Oculomotor deficits contribute to higher order cognitive deficits because those with schizophrenia perceive the environment abnormally.</p>"
"<p id=""P20"">Approximately 60% of individuals with schizophrenia have distortions in visual perception (<a href=""#R136"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R136"">Phillipson &amp; Harris, 1985</a>), and &gt;33% experience visual hallucinations (<a href=""#R168"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R168"">Silverstein &amp; Lai, 2021</a>). The range of perceptual deficits is broad and includes worse performance in assessments of contrast sensitivity (<a href=""#R62"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R62"">Harper et al., 2020</a>), detection of contour (<a href=""#R80"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R80"">Keane et al., 2014</a>), colour (<a href=""#R39"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R39"">Fernandes et al., 2019</a>), biological motion (<a href=""#R131"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R131"">Okruszek &amp; Pilecka, 2017</a>, but see <a href=""#R81"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R81"">Keane, Peng, et al., 2018</a>), faces (<a href=""#R111"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R111"">McCleery et al., 2015</a>) and stronger afterimages (<a href=""#R176"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R176"">Thakkar et al., 2021</a>). The extent of afterimage deficits is clinically relevant as they predict illness severity (<a href=""#R79"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R79"">Keane, Cruz, et al., 2018</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P21"">Similarly, accounts for visual deficits in schizophrenia spectrum disorders identify abnormalities in the anatomy of the retina (reviewed in <a href=""#R7"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R7"">Bernardin et al., 2017</a>; <a href=""#R167"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R167"">Silverstein et al., 2020</a>), as well as atypical network-level connectivity, both hypo- and hyper-connectivity, including cortical–medial temporal lobe abnormalities (reviewed in <a href=""#R168"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R168"">Silverstein &amp; Lai, 2021</a>). Together, the consistent oculomotor and low-level visual deficits suggest that processing from as early as the retina is abnormal in schizophrenia.</p>"
"<p id=""P22"">Given the range of oculomotor and low-level visual deficits identified in SSD, it is surprising how little work has been conducted in iconic memory. Several studies investigating iconic memory decay in those with schizophrenia have reported no differences in schizophrenia (<a href=""#R54"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R54"">Hahn et al., 2011</a>; <a href=""#R88"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R88"">Knight et al., 1978</a>). We know of no research evaluating iconic SM in schizotypy in the general population.</p>"
"<p id=""P23"">Similarly, it is noteworthy that in comparison with the high volume of research on the auditory MMN, there is little research assessing the visual MMN in schizophrenia and in SSD. However, atypical visual MMNs are documented and confirm that abnormal responses are not isolated to the auditory system. For example, the visual MMN is significantly reduced in individuals with schizophrenia in an oddball task using letters as stimuli (<a href=""#R127"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R127"">Neuhaus et al., 2013</a>), visual motion direction (<a href=""#R181"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R181"">Urban et al., 2008</a>) or horizontal compared with vertical grating patterns as oddballs (<a href=""#R37"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R37"">Farkas et al., 2015</a>), with a similarly large effect size in group differences. The same pattern of reduced MMN amplitude has been characterized in studies using emotional faces (<a href=""#R21"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R21"">Csukly et al., 2013</a>; <a href=""#R163"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R163"">She et al., 2017</a>; <a href=""#R192"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R192"">Yin et al., 2018</a>), in which the MMN reduction correlates with behavioural performance on an emotion recognition task (<a href=""#R21"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R21"">Csukly et al., 2013</a>). One recent finding reports that individuals with schizophrenia showed normal visual MMN elicited by fearful faces but diminished amplitude MMNs elicited by neutral faces (<a href=""#R183"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R183"">Vogel et al., 2018</a>). A new study has now identified larger visual MMN to happy compared with sad and neutral faces and found that MMN amplitude to the happy faces correlated with schizotypy scores, and interestingly, with measures of autism characteristics, highlighting the difficulty with MMN and specificity of diagnosis (<a href=""#R43"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R43"">Ford et al., 2022</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P24"">Another ERP that is linked to SM is the P1. Visual P1 responses were significantly smaller in schizophrenia in response to low (but not high) spatial frequency gratings that were not related to visual acuity (<a href=""#R37"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R37"">Farkas et al., 2015</a>). Although the P1 amplitudes did not correlate with symptoms, they were related to cognitive performance, as well as education level, duration of illness and measures of global functioning (<a href=""#R37"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R37"">Farkas et al., 2015</a>). Visual MMN has also been elicited in response to changes in the direction of moving dots and is significantly reduced in schizophrenia (<a href=""#R181"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R181"">Urban et al., 2008</a>). Visual MMN reduction was again associated with global functioning, general symptoms and medication dosage (<a href=""#R181"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R181"">Urban et al., 2008</a>), highlighting the parallels between visual and auditory MMN. Despite these similarities across the modalities, we found no findings describing the visual MMN in other SSD or high schizotypy participants.</p>"
"<p id=""P25"">In summary, despite notable visual and oculomotor involvement in SSD and a wealth of data demonstrating <em>auditory</em> SM deficits, little attention has been paid to <em>visual</em> SM specifically and no evidence of atypical iconic memory in SSD. Expanding visual SM research in the SSD population is needed to complement the auditory SM work and to deepen our understanding of visual SM contributions to other aspects of cognition.</p>"
"<p id=""P26"">WM deficits are a canonical deficit in people with schizophrenia (for reviews, see <a href=""#R41"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R41"">Forbes et al., 2009</a>; <a href=""#R98"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R98"">Lett et al., 2014</a>; <a href=""#R143"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R143"">Reichenberg, 2010</a>), those with high schizotypy (<a href=""#R166"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R166"">Siddi et al., 2017</a>) and those at high risk of psychosis (<a href=""#R116"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R116"">Millman et al., 2022</a>). WM impairments are broad and include verbal (reviewed in <a href=""#R158"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R158"">Seabury &amp; Cannon, 2020</a>), visuospatial and executive functioning aspects of WM (<a href=""#R4"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R4"">Barch &amp; Ceaser, 2012</a>; <a href=""#R41"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R41"">Forbes et al., 2009</a>). It is worth noting that poor WM performance in people with schizophrenia is associated with a variety of neural differences including reduced grey matter volume (<a href=""#R32"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R32"">Du et al., 2022</a>; <a href=""#R90"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R90"">Kochunov et al., 2022</a>), abnormal (hypo- and hyper-) connectivity patterns (<a href=""#R26"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R26"">Ding et al., 2019</a>; <a href=""#R32"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R32"">Du et al., 2022</a>; <a href=""#R45"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R45"">Fryer et al., 2015</a>; <a href=""#R63"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R63"">Hashimoto et al., 2010</a>; <a href=""#R157"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R157"">Schutte et al., 2021</a>; <a href=""#R158"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R158"">Seabury &amp; Cannon, 2020</a>; <a href=""#R180"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R180"">Unschuld et al., 2014</a>), hypoactive clusters (<a href=""#R158"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R158"">Seabury &amp; Cannon, 2020</a>) and abnormal oscillations (<a href=""#R144"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R144"">Reilly et al., 2018</a>). At a lower level, one account of the WM deficit in schizophrenia suggests that prefrontal cortex (PFC) <em>inhibition</em> is disrupted, leading to impaired WM (<a href=""#R114"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R114"">Meiron et al., 2022</a>). PFC inhibition is thought to be driven by abnormal interneuron function, which in turn reduces gamma oscillation amplitude (<a href=""#R144"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R144"">Reilly et al., 2018</a>; see also <a href=""#R178"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R178"">Toader et al., 2020</a>). A challenge in specifying underlying neural mechanisms of the WM deficit is that there is variability across samples with different patterns emerging in distinguishable subgroups (<a href=""#R146"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R146"">Rodriguez et al., 2019</a>). Advances in neuroimaging provide important future paths for identifying biomarkers of WM that reflect schizophrenia symptoms and for producing therapies to mitigate symptoms. In the paragraphs below, we specify the findings specific to auditory and visual WM as a parallel to the sections on auditory and visual SM above.</p>"
"<p id=""P27"">Auditory WM is impaired across SSD. Deficits are known in schizophrenia, their first-degree relatives (<a href=""#R160"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R160"">Seidman et al., 2012</a>; <a href=""#R161"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R161"">Seidman, Pousada-Casal, et al., 2016</a>) and in the high-risk population (<a href=""#R65"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R65"">Higuchi et al., 2013</a>; <a href=""#R148"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R148"">Rutschmann et al., 1980</a>), as is verbal WM (<a href=""#R158"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R158"">Seabury &amp; Cannon, 2020</a>). Importantly, this deficit is apparent even in early-course schizophrenia (<a href=""#R50"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R50"">Gonzalez-Blanch et al., 2006</a>) and is associated with abnormal neural responses (<a href=""#R95"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R95"">Leicht et al., 2015</a>; <a href=""#R133"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R133"">Papageorgiou et al., 2001</a>). Importantly, auditory WM performance predicts the presence of auditory hallucinations (<a href=""#R49"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R49"">Gisselgard et al., 2014</a>; <a href=""#R76"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R76"">Jenkins et al., 2018</a>). Therefore, similar to auditory SM, WM deficits may be related to <em>symptoms</em> rather than onset of psychosis.</p>"
"<p id=""P28"">Potential WM biomarkers are associated with altered neural function and patterns of neural connectivity. The neural correlates of WM deficits include the PFC (for a review, see <a href=""#R63"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R63"">Hashimoto et al., 2010</a>) and relevant sensory cortices (e.g., <a href=""#R75"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R75"">Javitt &amp; Sweet, 2015</a>; <a href=""#R115"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R115"">Menon et al., 2001</a>; <a href=""#R173"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R173"">Stevens et al., 1998</a>). However, when investigating the neural correlates associated with abnormal WM functioning in schizophrenia, there is inconsistency. Several studies reported PFC <em>hyperactivity</em>, whereas others reported the opposite (for a review, see <a href=""#R96"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R96"">Leitman et al., 2005</a>). Other brain areas implicated in WM retrieval include parietal regions (for a review, see <a href=""#R46"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R46"">Funahashi, 2017</a>; <a href=""#R61"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R61"">Hamilton et al., 2018</a>; <a href=""#R132"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R132"">Olson &amp; Berryhill, 2009</a>). Parietal function is also abnormal in schizophrenia particularly in those who hallucinate (<a href=""#R63"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R63"">Hashimoto et al., 2010</a>; <a href=""#R187"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R187"">Wible et al., 2009</a>), and hypoactive temporal lobe activity (<a href=""#R187"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R187"">Wible et al., 2009</a>) correlates with schizophrenia symptom severity (<a href=""#R115"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R115"">Menon et al., 2001</a>). More recent analyses investigating altered connectivity extend these region-of-interest findings by identifying network dysfunction. For example, increased dorsolateral and medial PFC connectivity in those with schizophrenia and their nonclinical first-degree relatives, compared with controls (<a href=""#R180"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R180"">Unschuld et al., 2014</a>), and within left superior frontal gyrus (<a href=""#R26"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R26"">Ding et al., 2019</a>). Several distinct patterns of hyper- and hypo-connectivity are associated with deficits in verbal WM in people with schizophrenia—including altered salience network (SN), default mode network (DMN) and frontoparietal network (FPN) interactions (<a href=""#R146"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R146"">Rodriguez et al., 2019</a>). Together, there is a network-level deficit in schizophrenia that impacts auditory WM.</p>"
"<p id=""P29"">Some evidence suggests that auditory WM deficits are associated with other auditory-related symptoms such as auditory hallucinations (<a href=""#R48"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R48"">Geng et al., 2020</a>; <a href=""#R49"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R49"">Gisselgard et al., 2014</a>; <a href=""#R76"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R76"">Jenkins et al., 2018</a>) and auditory processing deficits (<a href=""#R120"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R120"">Moschopoulos et al., 2021</a>). For example, deficits in MMN to pitch deviants were related to deficits in prosody processing (non-verbal communication of emotion) in individuals with schizophrenia (<a href=""#R96"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R96"">Leitman et al., 2005</a>) and P50 suppression in the auditory ERP correlated with WM performance (<a href=""#R61"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R61"">Hamilton et al., 2018</a>). Network connectivity also identifies altered DMN activity associated with auditory hallucinations (<a href=""#R48"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R48"">Geng et al., 2020</a>). Finally, there is an intriguing observation that the visual word form area engages during auditory perception and WM in people with schizophrenia (<a href=""#R64"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R64"">Herman et al., 2020</a>), suggesting that broadly altered structure and function underlie auditory WM function.</p>"
"<p id=""P30"">Worse WM performance is implicated in schizotypy (<a href=""#R134"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R134"">Park &amp; McTigue, 1997</a>; <a href=""#R166"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R166"">Siddi et al., 2017</a>), particularly in those who displayed more positive and negative symptoms (<a href=""#R155"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R155"">Schmidt-Hansen &amp; Honey, 2009</a>) and was associated with worse communication abilities (<a href=""#R83"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R83"">Kerns &amp; Becker, 2008</a>). It has also been suggested that poorer WM performance may be a biomarker for increased risk of developing psychosis because of the large effect sizes shown in schizotypy (<a href=""#R166"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R166"">Siddi et al., 2017</a>). However, there is debate as to the robustness of the WM deficit (<a href=""#R97"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R97"">Lenzenweger &amp; Gold, 2000</a>) and whether the effect is due to impaired attentional ability, with some evidence indicating dissociable deficits (<a href=""#R107"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R107"">Marsh et al., 2017</a>). In summary, abnormalities in auditory WM in schizophrenia are seen in diminished form in individuals with high schizotypy. This supports the idea that traits associated with schizophrenia are on a spectrum. Notably, compared with the auditory SM research, there is remarkably little research conducted on biomarkers of auditory WM deficits across the SSD.</p>"
"<p id=""P31"">A broad literature investigates visual WM deficits in people with schizophrenia and related disorders. Deficits in object, spatial and verbal WM are well-documented in review articles (e.g., <a href=""#R3"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R3"">Barch, 2005</a>; <a href=""#R53"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R53"">Haenschel &amp; Linden, 2011</a>; <a href=""#R137"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R137"">Piskulic et al., 2007</a>). Briefly, across measures of accuracy, reaction time and confidence, individuals with schizophrenia broadly perform less accurately, more slowly and less confidently than neurotypicals. Impaired WM extends to the at-risk and schizotypy populations. In the at-risk population, two recent metaanalyses point to WM performance as reflecting symptom severity. Overall cognition, attention, processing speed and WM were found to be significantly worse in those who were high-risk compared with healthy controls using the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB; <a href=""#R194"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R194"">Zheng et al., 2018</a>). Including both visual and auditory measures of WM and symptoms using the Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry was able to distinguish between individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia, their unaffected first-degree relatives and non-clinical individuals (<a href=""#R82"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R82"">Kent et al., 2004</a>). Importantly, neural accounts for the visual WM impairment note the contributing factor of abnormal SM and atypical prefrontal function (e.g., (<a href=""#R53"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R53"">Haenschel &amp; Linden, 2011</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P32"">A few biomarkers are associated with visual WM in SSD. There is a lower amplitude P100 (P1) response over electrode site Oz in individuals with schizophrenia (<a href=""#R52"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R52"">Haenschel et al., 2009</a>) and in those with high schizotypy (<a href=""#R92"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R92"">Koychev et al., 2010</a>) to a visual delayed discrimination task, highlighting the contribution of early sensory processing on later cognition. Others report that schizophrenia participants have abnormal theta power during n-back performance and reduced P100 in response to TMS pulses (<a href=""#R67"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R67"">Hoy et al., 2021</a>). Importantly, atypical gamma oscillations can be observed in first-episode psychosis (<a href=""#R117"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R117"">Missonnier et al., 2020</a>). Additional effects likely arise from gamma-band oscillatory activity during WM tasks that fail to increase with increased WM load in those with schizophrenia (<a href=""#R5"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R5"">Basar-Eroglu et al., 2007</a>; <a href=""#R16"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R16"">Cho et al., 2006</a>). A second biomarker of encoding-related WM deficit is the N2pc, which is also reduced in those with schizophrenia (<a href=""#R110"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R110"">Mayer et al., 2020</a>). Broadly atypical frontal lobe activations in at-risk youth (<a href=""#R182"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R182"">van Gool et al., 2022</a>) and connectivity patterns are known across schizophrenia spectrum disorders (<a href=""#R10"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R10"">Briend et al., 2020</a>; <a href=""#R154"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R154"">Schmidt et al., 2014</a>) and at-risk samples (<a href=""#R157"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R157"">Schutte et al., 2021</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P33"">In surveying the SSD literature, a patchy pattern emerges: Biomarkers associated with <em>auditory</em> SM (particularly the MMN) and <em>visual</em> WM in individuals with schizophrenia have been examined in detail and appear to be related to symptom severity. In contrast, the complement, visual SM and auditory WM, receive less attention. Progress is also hampered because there is little work conducted in SSD apart from those with a schizophrenia diagnosis. Diagnosed individuals often have comorbid diagnoses and require medications that can obscure the relationship between symptoms and biomarkers. To gain a foothold in the untapped areas (see <a href=""#T1"" class=""usa-link"">Table 1</a>), we argue that filling in the missing cells (visual SM, auditory WM) across SSD will accelerate the pace of data collection and expedite our ability to distinguish between competing theoretical perspectives. A final deficiency is that apart from the auditory MMN, there is little consistency in methodology, making studies difficult to generalize across. The standardization of auditory MMN procedures may be one of the reasons why the auditory MMN is one of the more compelling biomarkers of schizophrenia.</p>"
"<p id=""P34"">Our goal is to make clear that countering these oversights may improve the identification and characterization of useful biomarkers to better assess and mitigate SSD. For many researchers, including ourselves, gaining access to substantial clinical populations is improbable. Testing special populations, especially those with psychosis, impose ethical and practical difficulties with regard to care and consent. In contrast, evaluating subclinical populations provides a useful option in investigating SSD. It is also a conservative approach because those with high schizotypy are expected to show smaller, more modest effects than those with psychiatric diagnoses. As noted, perceptually, the auditory MMN is the best-studied biomarker associated with schizophrenia and abnormalities persist across SSD, including in the subclinical population. In visual WM, the range of analyses is more varied without commitment to a particular biomarker of SSD. The absence of clear biomarkers associated with the complementary areas of visual SM and auditory WM makes for a puzzling circumstance. Assuming a similar pattern of sensory and WM abnormalities in schizotypy to those found in diagnosed schizophrenia, focusing on schizotypy can help identify causal mechanisms that are linked to symptom severity. In short, we encourage ERP research in auditory and visual SM, and auditory and visual WM, preferably in the same clinical individuals as much as possible, and across SSD and subclinical populations.</p>"
"<p id=""P35"">One goal of documenting behavioural deficits and associated biomarkers of symptom severity in schizotypy is to improve clinical outcomes, potentially by identifying appropriate treatments related to the underlying mechanisms. Biomarkers could also document a patient’s progress, such as improvements of deterioration over time, and potentially identify the mechanism of improvement. For example, there is growing evidence that sensory training methods can improve cognition in schizophrenia. Auditory training methods that require learning to discriminate between different frequency-modulated sweeps improve auditory processing speed (<a href=""#R9"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R9"">Biagianti et al., 2016</a>) and executive functioning (<a href=""#R22"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R22"">Dale et al., 2016</a>). Extending this observation, multisensory (visual and audio) training on three simultaneity judgement tasks reduced the temporal binding window in a neurotypical group, with effects lasting 7 days. The multisensory versions had bigger effects than the unisensory versions. Training duration had little effect on improvements in the temporal binding window (<a href=""#R193"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R193"">Zerr et al., 2019</a>). A review of sensory-targeted cognitive training methods found consistent improvements in multiple areas of cognition (<a href=""#R31"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R31"">Donde, Mondino, et al., 2019</a>), including WM (<a href=""#R69"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R69"">Hubacher et al., 2013</a>; <a href=""#R93"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R93"">Lawlor-Savage &amp; Goghari, 2014</a>). If the early auditory signal is improved, this would benefit later auditory processing. However, benefits were short-lived and time-intensive. One theorized mechanism of sensory training is that it induces neural plasticity, providing a window to normalize sensory and cognitive functioning. Indeed, <a href=""#R31"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R31"">Donde, Mondino, et al. (2019)</a> reviewed biomarkers of schizophrenia that normalized after sensory training. They highlighted that training imposes <em>no known side effects</em> and it may provide a more holistic approach to reducing schizophrenia symptomatology. Others note that ignoring sensory issues creates an informational ‘bottleneck’ that hampers patients’ ability to improve cognitive functioning (<a href=""#R47"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R47"">Genevsky et al., 2010</a>). Training in processing speed showed greater improvements across cognitive abilities compared with narrow effects after WM training (<a href=""#R13"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R13"">Cassetta et al., 2019</a>). Improving low-level sensory processing benefits upstream processing, but more work is essential to determine which approach best alleviates symptoms. Focusing on schizotypy may allow for some of the mechanisms to be disentangled through more detailed investigation without clinical complications such as medications and contact time in the clinic.</p>"
"<p id=""P36"">Other treatments, including noninvasive stimulation approaches (e.g., transcranial direct current stimulation [tDCS] and transcranial magnetic stimulation [TMS]), report improvements in sensory and cognitive markers and reduce symptoms (reviewed in <a href=""#R8"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R8"">Berryhill &amp; Martin, 2018</a>). For example, anodal tDCS improved pitch MMN amplitude and 2-back WM performance in people with schizophrenia (<a href=""#R70"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R70"">Impey et al., 2017</a>). A separate study reported improved auditory P50 ERP response and reduced auditory hallucinations after anodal tDCS (<a href=""#R85"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R85"">Kim et al., 2018</a>). In treatment-resistant individuals with schizophrenia, a TMS protocol (intermittent theta burst stimulation) targeting left PFC improved visual WM ability and reduced symptoms (<a href=""#R184"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R184"">Wang et al., 2022</a>). However, a recent meta-analysis evaluating findings from TMS and tDCS approaches reports no collective benefit across 22 studies (<a href=""#R170"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R170"">Sloan et al., 2021</a>). Early-stage neurostimulation findings show promise, in terms of behaviour and normalized biomarkers. However, small sample sizes, brief protocols and a variable clinical population contribute to heterogeneous outcomes and a need for optimization. It is also unclear how stimulation methods would impact a less symptomatic population, particularly if the biomarkers in schizotypy are less pronounced than they are in diagnosed individuals.</p>"
"<p id=""P37"">When assessing biomarkers of symptom severity, there is a burgeoning question as to whether some of the biomarkers already discussed here can be used to predict the onset of schizophrenia. This assumes that biomarkers related to symptom severity worsen in some way immediately before the onset of schizophrenia. However, even if this is not the case, it could be that a different combination of symptom-related biomarkers is helpful in predicting conversion.</p>"
"<p id=""P38"">Ideally, a biomarker could be used to identify single individuals as approaching schizophrenia with enough confidence to justify beginning treatment before an official diagnosis. Although biomarkers need to have a high degree of predictive accuracy, there is also the issue of specificity. Individuals with bipolar disorder may experience psychosis, but unlike schizophrenia, it is not necessary for diagnosis. This overlap in psychosis means that a successful biomarker needs to be sufficiently <em>sensitive</em> to predict onset of psychosis and be <em>specific</em> to SSD (<a href=""#R71"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R71"">Insel et al., 2011</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P39"">As previously discussed, biomarkers of SM, particularly the auditory MMN, have been singled out for being reliably smaller in chronic schizophrenia compared with neurotypical individuals (<a href=""#R124"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R124"">Naatanen et al., 2015</a>; <a href=""#R179"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R179"">Umbricht &amp; Krljes, 2005</a>). A recent large-sample study found typical MMN in unaffected siblings of people with schizophrenia, leading them to propose that reduced MMN may be closely linked with the onset of psychosis (<a href=""#R28"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R28"">Donaldson et al., 2021</a>). However, efforts to date have found that the auditory MMN is only slightly smaller in early course schizophrenia (<a href=""#R100"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R100"">Lho et al., 2020</a>; <a href=""#R152"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R152"">Salisbury et al., 2007</a>) and is not reliably reduced in individuals at their first-episode of schizophrenia (<a href=""#R34"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R34"">Erickson et al., 2016</a>; <a href=""#R58"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R58"">Haigh, Coffman, &amp; Salisbury, 2017</a>), or in first-degree unaffected relatives (<a href=""#R105"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R105"">Magno et al., 2008</a>). Furthermore, longitudinal studies following individuals who are at risk of developing schizophrenia have yet to detect robust reductions in auditory MMN that provide any confidence of impending conversion to psychosis (<a href=""#R1"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R1"">Atkinson et al., 2017</a>; <a href=""#R34"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R34"">Erickson et al., 2016</a>; <a href=""#R91"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R91"">Koshiyama et al., 2017</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P40"">However, the emphasis on a <em>single</em> biomarker to predict psychosis onset may be the issue. In the at-risk population, two recent meta-analyses point to WM performance as a predictor of developing psychosis. For instance, re-evaluating findings relying on the MCCB identified the factors of overall cognition, attention, processing speed and WM as <em>significantly</em> predictive of developing psychosis (<a href=""#R194"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R194"">Zheng et al., 2018</a>). This is broadly consistent with an earlier meta-analysis that selected WM and visual learning to identify individuals likely to develop psychosis (<a href=""#R24"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R24"">De Herdt et al., 2013</a>). In individuals with schizotypy, meta-analysis again pointed to a general deficit across verbal and visuospatial WM as a significant predictor of developing psychosis (<a href=""#R166"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R166"">Siddi et al., 2017</a>). Multifactorial analyses of multiple biomarkers have improved specificity of predicting who is at risk of developing schizophrenia later in life (<a href=""#R162"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R162"">Seidman, Shapiro, et al., 2016</a>), and with improvements in machine learning, more sophisticated tools are available to detect even subtle patterns of functional abnormalities in SSD (<a href=""#R174"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R174"">Tai et al., 2019</a>).</p>"
"<p id=""P41"">To address the public health challenge associated with schizophrenia, we should accelerate our understanding of SSD through identification of useful biomarkers of SSD. This includes conducting research in overlooked sensory modalities (e.g., chemical senses and somatosensation). We need to be more cognizant of gaps in our understanding of sensory processing and their contributions to later cognitive processing. One way to do this is to measure responses from different parts of the sensory processing stream simultaneously. Advancements in technology, reduction in the price of certain electrophysiology equipment and improvements in methodology have made this approach a reality without having to build equipment from scratch.</p>"
"<p id=""P42"">SM and WM deficits in those with high schizotypy and individuals with diagnosed schizophrenia highlight that schizophrenia really is a spectrum of symptoms. Focusing on schizotypy requires a larger sample size that is needed to detect the smaller effects (compared with schizophrenia) but offers a straightforward method for assessing relationships between symptom severity and functioning along the schizophrenia spectrum. Because of the lack of studies focusing on multisensory and multidomain functioning in schizotypy, we are forced to assume that the benefits of multivariate biomarkers will be as helpful in characterizing those with high schizotypy as it should be in the diagnosed population.</p>"
"<p id=""P43"">The deficits in SM and WM along the schizophrenia spectrum offer insight into how these previously disparate abnormalities interact and accrue downstream effects. Furthermore, they highlight the value of investigating the use of early-stage sensory interventions for treatment. There is already some evidence of <em>training</em> in SM or WM to alleviate deficits. The effectiveness of sensory training on symptoms has implications for other conditions associated with sensory abnormalities. Assessing biomarkers along the sensory pathway and treating early sensory symptoms is being used in autism (<a href=""#R27"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R27"">Dinstein et al., 2015</a>; <a href=""#R55"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R55"">Haigh, 2018</a>; <a href=""#R186"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R186"">Whitaker et al., 2016</a>) and in bipolar depression (for a review, see <a href=""#R169"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R169"">Sit &amp; Haigh, 2019</a>). However, it will be important to demonstrate whether these mechanisms are (1) causal and (2) sensory modality specific.</p>"
"<p id=""P44"">Comparing SM and WM has the added benefit of identifying biomarkers and neural mechanisms that are unique to schizophrenia symptomatology. For example, schizophrenia is indistinguishable from autism on neuropsychological tests, including WM (<a href=""#R33"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R33"">Eack et al., 2013</a>). The schizophrenia population differs from autism in their sensory responses, namely, individuals with schizophrenia typically under-respond, whereas individuals with autism tend to over-respond (<a href=""#R57"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R57"">Haigh et al., 2016</a>, <a href=""#R60"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""R60"">2022</a>). Identifying multiple biomarkers associated with schizophrenia and SSD more broadly can help with diagnostic specificity with greater accuracy than single markers.</p>"
"<p id=""P45"">To improve outcomes associated with schizophrenia, new approaches are needed. We advocate for collecting multiple biomarkers from available, subclinical populations that can collectively monitor symptoms and reveal the mechanisms underlying the symptoms. Alternatively, they may identify treatment successes. With a more complete mechanistic understanding of schizophrenia, such a suite of biomarkers could identify appropriate courses of treatment that will improve long-term outcomes.</p>"

"<p>The term <em>depression</em> is overused as an umbrella term for a variety of conditions, including depressed mood and various psychiatric disorders. According to psychiatric diagnostic criteria, depressive disorders impact nearly all aspects of human life and are a leading cause of disability worldwide. The widespread assumption that different types of depression lie on a continuum of severity has stimulated important research on subthreshold depression in later life. This view assumes that depressed mood is a precursor of a depressive disorder. The present narrative review argues why in later life depressed mood might either (i) lie on a continuum with depressive disorders among people vulnerable for a depressive disorder or (ii) be an ageing-related epiphenomenon of underlying physical illnesses in people who are resilient to depressive disorders (‘discontinuity hypothesis’). Three arguments are discussed. First, the course of depressed mood and depressive disorders differs across the life span. Second, screening instruments for depression have low predictive value for depressive disorders in later life. Third, a dose–response relationship has not been consistently found across different types of depression and detrimental health outcomes. Using the umbrella term <em>depression</em> may partly explain why pharmacological treatment is less effective with increasing age, and negative health-related outcomes might be overestimated. The discontinuity hypothesis may prevent pharmacological overtreatment of milder subtypes of depression and may stimulate comprehensive multidisciplinary assessment as well as the development of separate treatment algorithms for depressed mood and depressive disorders.</p>"
"<p><strong>Keywords:</strong> depressive disorder, depression, nosology, classification, aged, aged, 80 years and over, older people</p>"
<p>Distinguishing between depressed mood and depressive disorders according to diagnostic criteria is crucial for preventing overtreatment and iatrogenic harm.</p>
<p>Depression screening instruments or fully structured diagnostic interviews might overestimate the prevalence of depressive disorders in later life and their association with ill health.</p>
"<p>In later life, clinical judgement of somatic-affective symptoms is necessary for accurate diagnosis procedures and requires the use of semi-structured diagnostic interviews.</p>"
<p>Procedures for diagnosing depression and depressed mood might benefit from a comprehensive geriatric approach.</p>
"<p>
<em>Watchful waiting</em>, psychosocial intervention, physical exercises and psychotherapy might be preferable to antidepressant medication for depressed mood in later life.</p>"
<p>Randomised controlled trials on later-life depression should be stratified according to diagnostic subtypes and vulnerability markers for depressive disorders.</p>
"<p>The term <em>depression</em> is overused in the scientific literature as an umbrella term for either a single symptom of depressed mood, a multidimensional construct assessed with rating scales [<a href=""#ref1"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref1"">1</a>] or a syndrome identified according to diagnostic criteria [<a href=""#ref2"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref2"">2</a>]. These operationalisations are often used interchangeably, which hampers interpretation of clinical-epidemiological studies. <a href=""#TB1"" class=""usa-link"">Box 1</a> defines the different types of depression as they are used in this manuscript. Because definitions of depression are not mutually exclusive, we sometimes use the umbrella term <em>depression</em> to avoid incorrectly citing articles that include more than one definition.</p>"
"<p>Using different operational definitions of depression interchangeably implicitly assumes that depression is a dimensional construct ranging from having mild symptoms to having a full-blown depressive disorder. This widespread assumption has stimulated important research on the clinical relevance of milder subtypes of depression in later life [<a href=""#ref3"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref3"">3</a>]. A systematic review on the milder subtypes of depression reported a high prevalence in later life and an association with adverse health outcomes, prompting the authors to recommend more research on the neurobiology and treatment of these subtypes [<a href=""#ref3"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref3"">3</a>]. An important limitation was the heterogeneity in the definitions of the milder subtypes of depression. This precluded the possibility of a meta-analysis and also seemed to question the robustness of the findings because some of the definitions of depression may have resulted in spurious associations.</p>"
<p>Operationalisations of late-life depression</p>
"<p>
<sup>a</sup>
<em>Note</em>: Depressed mood (or anhedonia) is a core symptom of all syndrome operationalisations. Nonetheless, <em>depressive symptoms</em> (dimensional) or <em>clinically relevant depressive symptoms</em> (exceeding a cut-off value) are based on either self-report or observer-rated scales and do not necessarily signify depressed mood or anhedonia.</p>"
"<p>Considering a continuity between depressed mood and depressive disorder, however, matches the dimensional approach to psychopathology as described in the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP) initiative [<a href=""#ref4"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref4"">4</a>]. This approach identifies psychopathology constructs based on patterns of co-variation among symptoms [<a href=""#ref5"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref5"">5</a>]. The HiTOP approach might help in the identification of universal risk factors by linking them to transdiagnostic spectra [<a href=""#ref5"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref5"">5</a>]. Arguments for a dimensional approach to depression often rely on studies that have identified the same determinants and health consequences in milder subtypes of depression as in depressive disorder [<a href=""#ref6"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref6"">6</a>]. Nonetheless, a dimensional approach does not (i) offer a solution to the multifactorial nature of psychiatric disorders, (ii) identify the relative contribution of specific risk factors in individual patients or (iii) acknowledge the periodicity of psychiatric disorders [<a href=""#ref7"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref7"">7</a>]. Regarding depression in later life, potential changes in the relative contribution of different risk factors that accompany ageing are not addressed [<a href=""#ref7"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref7"">7</a>]. Neither is the differential impact of risk factors along the degree of severity of the depression, nor the potential discontinuity between depressed mood and depressive disorders.</p>"
<p>The present narrative review critically evaluates arguments as to why a depressed mood or depressive symptoms might not necessarily lie on a continuum with depressive disorders in later life. It also addresses how this discontinuity hypothesis might inform clinical practice and future research in geriatric psychiatry.</p>
"<p>This narrative review is based on a literature search of systematic reviews and meta-analyses on depression in later life. Keywords related to <em>depression</em> and <em>old age</em> were combined with the terms <em>systematic review</em> and <em>meta-analysis</em> to search for articles in <em>PubMed</em> up until 1 July 2023. This yielded 2,291 hits. Reviews relevant to the objectives of the present paper were extracted and reviewed in detail. In addition, individual papers that were cited in the reviews were extracted. Publications on bipolar depressive disorder were considered outside the scope of this review.</p>"
"<p>In this section, we discuss the empirical findings that support the discontinuity hypothesis, and we indicate that depressed mood and depressive disorder might become separate pathways with ageing.</p>"
"<p>It has long been thought that depressive disorders have their highest prevalence in older age groups, but compelling evidence from epidemiological studies now demonstrates the opposite [<a href=""#ref8"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref8"">8</a>]. Among 146,315 people aged 18 to 80, advanced non-linear models showed that the prevalence of depressive disorders reached a plateau between the ages of 30 and 50 and decreased thereafter [<a href=""#ref9"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref9"">9</a>]. By contrast, depressive symptomatology was more stable across the lifespan and even increased after the age of 65 [<a href=""#ref9"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref9"">9</a>]. This study is consistent with incidence studies, which show that lower incidence rates with increasing age disappear when depression is not defined as a depressive disorder, such as dysthymia or minor depression [<a href=""#ref10"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref10"">10–12</a>]. The different trajectories of milder subtypes of depression and depressive disorder according to age suggest that a depressed mood has a different meaning and a different origin in later life than in younger age groups, and it less often progresses into a depressive disorder. Otherwise, the absolute and relative contribution of a depressed mood as a risk factor for depressive disorder differs according to age.</p>"
"<p>Considering that late-life depressive disorders are common and on a continuum with depressed mood, one would expect that cut-off values on depression rating scales would have high positive predictive value (PPV) for depressive disorder. Self-report screening questionnaires, however, overestimate the prevalence of depressive disorder [<a href=""#ref13"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref13"">13</a>]. Cut-off scores on the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15) or on the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS) were at best in moderate agreement with the diagnosis of a depressive disorder based on a semi-structured diagnostic interview (Kappa values ranged from 0.22 to 0.31) [<a href=""#ref14"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref14"">14</a>]. Furthermore, the PPV from self-report depression screening questionnaires is rather low, with reported values as low as 13 and 23% for depressive disorder (but negative predictive values of 96 and 99%) [<a href=""#ref15"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref15"">15</a>, <a href=""#ref16"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref16"">16</a>]. These values show that these scales are optimised to exclude the possibility of a depressive disorder, whereas in epidemiological studies these scales are generally used as proxies for a depressive disorder. Misclassification biases might be particularly problematic in geriatric psychiatry because false positives are associated with increasing age, physical illness, disability and cognitive decline [<a href=""#ref16"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref16"">16–18</a>]. A low PPV may indicate confounding resulting from underlying somatic illnesses and inflate prospective associations between depression as assessed with self-report scales and negative health outcomes.</p>"
"<p>A dimensional approach to depression in later life assumes a dose–response relationship with negative health-related outcomes. Consider mortality, the ultimate adverse outcome. Meta-analysis of population-based studies did not found that the increased mortality risk differed significantly between people suffering from a depressive disorder and those with clinically relevant depressive symptoms or minor depression [<a href=""#ref19"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref19"">19</a>]. Another meta-analysis showed that the relative risk of mortality associated with depression did not differ between 166 studies that used self-report scales (RR =1.64, 95% CI = 1.49–1.80) and 72 studies that used a diagnostic interview (RR = 1.64, 95% CI = 1.56–1.73) [<a href=""#ref20"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref20"">20</a>]. Symptoms of physical illnesses may be picked up by self-report depressive symptom scales and confound associations of milder types of depression with mortality resulting in similar strengths as found for depressive disorders.</p>"
"<p>Among clinical samples of depressed patients, even inverse associations have been reported. For instance, in the Netherlands Study of Depression in Older people, mortality rates that were adjusted for health-related behaviours and morbidity were significantly higher among those suffering from minor depression compared to those suffering from a depressive disorder [<a href=""#ref21"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref21"">21</a>]. One explanation is that minor depression in later life also reflects symptoms due to ageing-related processes, such as physical and cognitive impairments that are associated with mortality [<a href=""#ref21"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref21"">21</a>]. Among 4,243 patients aged ≥65 and diagnosed with depressive disorder, a higher mortality risk was associated with proxies of biological ageing [<a href=""#ref22"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref22"">22</a>]. Conversely, in this latter study core features of depression were associated with lower mortality risk [<a href=""#ref22"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref22"">22</a>].</p>"
"<p>Collectively, these findings seem to point to biased estimates due to confounding by underlying physical illnesses.</p>"
"<p>Non-specific symptoms related to physical ageing or physical illness, such as fatigue or concentration problems, may easily be classified as symptoms of a depressive disorder. In the AgeMooDe study of 1,197 participants aged 75+ years, exceeding the cut-off for either the GDS-15 or the HADS was associated with greater disability than that of clinical diagnosis of depressive disorder [<a href=""#ref14"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref14"">14</a>]. This may indicate an overestimation of depression with the GDS or the HADS due to chronic disease-related disability.</p>"
"<p>Because ageing-related physical changes are associated with low mood and anhedonia [<a href=""#ref23"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref23"">23</a>] as well as with adverse health effects [<a href=""#ref24"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref24"">24</a>], self-reported depressive symptoms may inflate negative health outcomes in mild cases of late-life depression. To illustrate the potential impact of this issue, <a href=""#TB2"" class=""usa-link"">Table 1</a> summarises the most recent meta-analyses on adverse health outcomes of late-life depression. Only a minority of studies (median = 25%) included in these meta-analyses have assessed depression according to psychiatric diagnostic criteria [<a href=""#ref25"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref25"">25–31</a>].</p>"
<p>Depression as a predictor for adverse health outcomes</p>
"<p>For instance, after a myocardial infarction, patients’ depressive symptom severity is inversely associated with the left ventricular ejection fraction [<a href=""#ref32"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref32"">32</a>], and low scores on depression scales specifically indicated an underlying somatic illness [<a href=""#ref33"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref33"">33</a>]. Furthermore, frailty and depression may easily be confused due to overlapping diagnostic criteria [<a href=""#ref34"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref34"">34</a>], but the overlap with depressive disorder is still less compared to self-report depressive symptoms [<a href=""#ref35"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref35"">35</a>]. Even though more than 280 rating scales have been developed to assess depression [<a href=""#ref36"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref36"">36</a>], none of them has satisfactorily solved this problem. Paradoxically, depression rating scales designed for older people (e.g. the GDS-15) exclude or minimise the importance of somatic-affective symptoms, although these symptoms are intrinsically related to depressive disorders, and depressive disorders have a more somatic presentation in later life [<a href=""#ref37"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref37"">37</a>]. Therefore, appropriate clinical evaluations of somatic-affective symptoms are needed in clinical practice [<a href=""#ref38"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref38"">38</a>].</p>"
"<p>Whether depression is a causal factor in dementia or a prodrome (and thus an epiphenomenon) of neurodegenerative processes is unclear. The two possibilities are, however, not mutually exclusive [<a href=""#ref39"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref39"">39</a>]. Arguments for a causative relationship are as follows: (1) there is a dose–response relationship between depression severity and the onset of dementia, and (2) early-onset depression is associated with dementia [<a href=""#ref29"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref29"">29</a>]. A Danish register-based cohort study that included almost 600,000 men supported the second argument by showing that midlife depression doubled the risk of dementia in later life [<a href=""#ref40"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref40"">40</a>]. Arguments supporting the hypothesis that depression is a prodrome of dementia are as follows: (i) there are stronger associations with late-onset versus early-onset late-life depression; and (ii) stronger associations have been reported in studies with shorter follow-up periods [<a href=""#ref29"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref29"">29</a>]. Longitudinal studies with repeated assessments of depressive symptoms have also supported the prodromal hypothesis. In the Rotterdam scan study, increasing levels of self-reported depressive symptoms across 10 years predicted the onset of dementia, whereas consistently elevated self-reported depressive symptoms did not [<a href=""#ref41"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref41"">41</a>]. In the Whitehall-II study, which included over 10,000 participants, depressive symptoms across 28 years were analysed, and results showed that differences in self-reported depressive symptoms between those with and without dementia became apparent 11 years before the onset of dementia and were nine times larger during the year of the diagnosis [<a href=""#ref42"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref42"">42</a>]. These different pathways would appear to warrant different treatment approaches.</p>"
"<p>A shift in etiological mechanisms for depression occurring with ageing might explain why the prevalence of milder subtypes of depression increase with ageing, but depressive disorders decrease with ageing.</p>"
"<p>Meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies has concluded that ‘all humans carry lesser or greater numbers of genetic risk factors for depressive disorder, which implies that a continuous measure of risk underlies the clinical phenotype’ [<a href=""#ref43"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref43"">43</a>]. Genetic risk, however, might differ among the different subtypes of depression. In three large twin samples, total heritability differed little between depressive disorders (0.31) and depressive symptoms (0.30), while the proportion of genetic risk that was unique for life-time depressive disorders was 65% but for depressive symptoms 0% [<a href=""#ref44"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref44"">44</a>]. In other words, a depressed mood or depressive symptoms are not adequate proxies for the genetic vulnerability to a depressive disorder [<a href=""#ref44"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref44"">44</a>]. Furthermore, the inverse association between age of onset of a depressive disorder and genetic risk factors for a depressive disorder [<a href=""#ref43"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref43"">43</a>, <a href=""#ref45"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref45"">45</a>] implies that other risk factors become more important in later life or that new risk factors emerge with a later onset.</p>"
"<p>Vulnerability for the different types of depression, however, includes more than genetics [<a href=""#ref46"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref46"">46</a>]. It is often assumed that resilience increases with age because of lower prevalence rates of mental illnesses in old age [<a href=""#ref47"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref47"">47</a>]. Meta-regression analyses have shown better emotion-regulation strategies with increasing age, but no study has included participants older than 65 [<a href=""#ref48"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref48"">48</a>]. More recent studies comparing younger and older (65+) adults have found that older adults become especially adept at suppressing negative affect [<a href=""#ref49"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref49"">49</a>, <a href=""#ref50"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref50"">50</a>]. An alternative hypothesis for the low rates of psychopathology in later life is the <em>on-time</em>, <em>off-time</em> hypothesis for explaining psychosocial stressors. Although stressors such as loneliness, bereavement and physical disabilities are by far more prevalent in later life, these same stressors might trigger higher stress levels in younger age groups [<a href=""#ref7"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref7"">7</a>]. Nonetheless, older people may still respond to these stressors with a depressed mood, and this would explain the highest prevalence of the milder subtypes of depression in the oldest age groups.</p>"
"<p>During the past decades, vascular ageing [<a href=""#ref51"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref51"">51</a>], cognitive ageing (neurodegeneration) [<a href=""#ref52"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref52"">52</a>], physical ageing (frailty) [<a href=""#ref53"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref53"">53</a>], dopamine dysfunction [<a href=""#ref54"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref54"">54</a>] and low-grade inflammation (‘inflammageing’) [<a href=""#ref55"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref55"">55</a>] have received attention as risk factors for all subtypes of depression, and they are likely to become proportionally more relevant with ageing [<a href=""#ref7"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref7"">7</a>]. Whereas ageing mechanisms affect all older people to some extent, only a minority of them become clinically depressed. One might hypothesise that the ageing-related mechanisms result in a depressed mood that may or may not progress into a depressive disorder in an individual depending on their vulnerability for depressive disorder (<a href=""#f1"" class=""usa-link"">Figure 1</a>).</p>"

"<p>Conceptualisation of the ‘discontinuity hypothesis’. <em>Note</em>: Age-related risk factors can contribute to a depressed mood. Among older individuals resilient to depressive disorder, their mood issues may not progress to a depressive disorder, whereas those vulnerable to depressive disorder face an increased risk of developing one. Although the figure suggests two mutually exclusive pathways, vulnerability and risk factors are dimensions that may partially overlap. Patients vulnerable to depressive disorder may also be at an increased risk of adverse somatic and cognitive health outcomes. Improving mental health throughout one’s life can enhance healthy ageing. For those experiencing a depressed mood due to age-related risk factors, the impact of such mood issues on adverse health outcomes might be a spurious association, explained by the direct effect of these age-related risk factors. Therefore, both risk factors and mood problems should be addressed in their case.</p>"
"<p>Even though the age-related mechanisms may often result in a depressed mood instead of a depressive disorder, it is important to acknowledge that in clinical practice, the mechanisms might be highly relevant. This is shown by the fact that although the median age of onset of a depressive disorder is 30 years (IQR 21–44) [<a href=""#ref56"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref56"">56</a>], consecutive sampling of depressed older patients in specialised mental health care shows that about half of them suffer from a late-onset depressive disorder [<a href=""#ref57"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref57"">57–59</a>].</p>"
"<p>To study these ageing-related mechanisms in-depth, studies should include both older people with depressed mood and those with a depressive disorder to learn how the mechanisms interact with vulnerability for a depressive disorder.</p>"
"<p>In contrast to medical syndromes, geriatric syndromes are not characterised by symptoms that collectively indicate a disease, but refer instead to multiple factors that are (i) prevalent in older adults and (ii) associated with adverse health outcomes [<a href=""#ref60"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref60"">60</a>]. Geriatric syndromes often refer to a single symptom, which does not represent one underlying pathophysiology, e.g. falls or urinary incontinence [<a href=""#ref61"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref61"">61</a>]. Late-life depression meets the definition of a geriatric syndrome; it is a common and multifactorial condition, which places an individual at increased risk of adverse health outcomes. Nonetheless, geriatric medicine may benefit from a better distinction between depression as a geriatric syndrome and depression as a psychiatric disorder according to diagnostic criteria.</p>"
"<p>When depressed mood originates from age-related pathophysiological processes or disability, one may assume a more chronic course and lower responsiveness to treatment.</p>"
"<p>Antidepressants are not effective for milder forms of depression [<a href=""#ref62"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref62"">62</a>]. Treating minor mood changes in frail older adults with antidepressants may even be harmful as even minor side effects may trigger adverse health effects [<a href=""#ref24"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref24"">24</a>]. Furthermore, having residual symptoms following treatment for depression may in some patients be an epiphenomenon of an underlying somatic illness [<a href=""#ref38"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref38"">38</a>]. Because antidepressants do not target age-related mechanisms, this might be why the effectiveness of antidepressants decreases with increasing age [<a href=""#ref63"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref63"">63</a>] and why the natural course of depression is less favourable and spontaneous remission is less likely among older adults [<a href=""#ref64"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref64"">64</a>, <a href=""#ref65"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref65"">65</a>].</p>"
"<p>Over-prescription of antidepressants is a timely topic. A medical records-linkage study with multidisciplinary expert review of antidepressant prescriptions found 24% of 3,199 new prescriptions for older people (65+) as potentially inappropriate. Over-prescription largely involved non-specific psychiatric symptoms and subthreshold diagnoses [<a href=""#ref66"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref66"">66</a>]. Another study, which concluded that over-prescribing of antidepressants was not a problem, found that 18% of 7,051 patients starting antidepressant treatment had low or mild depressive symptoms, ranging from 11% in patients &lt;30 to 26% in patients ≥65 [<a href=""#ref67"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref67"">67</a>]. Whether the data are acceptable or alarming, potentially inappropriate prescribing consistently increases with age [<a href=""#ref67"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref67"">67</a>, <a href=""#ref68"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref68"">68</a>]. To improve milder subtypes of depression in later life, several evidence-based options are available. Meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials have shown that both home-based interventions for reducing loneliness in later life, reminiscence therapy and physical exercise ameliorated depressive symptoms [<a href=""#ref69"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref69"">69–71</a>].</p>"
"<p>In the clinical geriatric assessment (CGA)-Swed study, 61% of frail older adults with unplanned hospital admissions suffered from clinically relevant depressive symptoms based on cut-off scores of an observer-rated depression scale [<a href=""#ref72"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref72"">72</a>]. Those randomly assigned for a CGA were more often prescribed antidepressants than those assigned to usual care. Although this was interpreted as positive, i.e. a reduction of undertreatment due to better case management [<a href=""#ref72"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref72"">72</a>], one might question whether pharmacological treatment for clinically relevant depressive symptoms is appropriate. In the Longitudinal Ageing Study Amsterdam, for example, only 15% of the patients who scored above a cut-off score on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale developed a depressive disorder during a 17-year follow-up, whereas 40% of them remained stable, and 45% recovered [<a href=""#ref73"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref73"">73</a>]. These figures argue for <em>watchful waiting</em> instead of immediately starting antidepressant treatment. Furthermore, the risk of falling due to antidepressant medication exponentially increases when patients are frail [<a href=""#ref74"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref74"">74</a>]. Because the item <em>being unable to do things that make one feel valued</em> was the only independent correlate of clinically relevant depressive symptoms in the CGA-Swed study, psychological interventions might have been a better treatment option [<a href=""#ref46"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref46"">46</a>, <a href=""#ref53"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref53"">53</a>]. Whereas studies of older adults are still limited, meta-analyses thus far point to similar or even higher efficacy for psychotherapy for depression with increasing age [<a href=""#ref75"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref75"">75</a>]. Outside the hospital, in two-thirds of the patients presenting with clinically relevant depressive symptoms, antidepressants were initiated during the first consultation [<a href=""#ref76"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref76"">76</a>, <a href=""#ref77"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref77"">77</a>]. Most older adults, however, prefer psychological support [<a href=""#ref78"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref78"">78</a>].</p>"
"<p>Screening for depression is not always advised. Although the US Preventive Services Task Force advocates depression screening with the GDS for older adults [<a href=""#ref79"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref79"">79</a>], the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care advises against screening for depression in general. This latter view is based on the lack of positive findings in randomised controlled trials, particularly in the case of collaborative care. Collaborative care may not be beneficial for patients who screen positive [<a href=""#ref80"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref80"">80</a>]. First, many patients are already being treated. Second, accuracy in identifying previously unrecognised patients is low. Third, treatment effects for less severe depression are relatively small [<a href=""#ref80"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref80"">80</a>]. These arguments may be particularly valid for depressed older persons, as the proportion of depressed people not meeting the criteria for a depressive disorder increases with increasing age [<a href=""#ref9"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref9"">9</a>].</p>"
"<p>The incidence of a depressive disorder among older adults with milder subtypes of depression is estimated to be at least 10% per year [<a href=""#ref3"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref3"">3</a>]. Therefore, prevention targeting people with depressed mood or elevated depressive symptoms may be effective [<a href=""#ref81"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref81"">81</a>]. In fact, a meta-analysis has shown that indicated prevention of late-life depression is effective [<a href=""#ref82"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref82"">82</a>], with a number needed to treat of 15 for psychotherapy [<a href=""#ref83"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref83"">83</a>].</p>"
"<p>Meta-analyses comparing treatment effects have revealed smaller effect-sizes when outcomes are based on self-reported versus clinician-rated scales [<a href=""#ref84"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref84"">84</a>]. This might suggest that clinicians can better distinguish between low mood as a symptom of a depressive disorder and low mood as an epiphenomenon of chronic somatic conditions. Clinician-rated scales are indeed considered the gold standard. Application in epidemiological studies, however, is generally too expensive since clinical experience is mandatory.</p>"
"<p>This narrative review is not intended to be a systematic literature review. Instead, it is a selective presentation of the literature to substantiate that the prevalence and negative health outcomes of late-life depression may be overestimated as a result of considering depressed mood to be at the lower end of a continuum with depressive disorders at the other end. A better understanding of clinical experience is important because the epidemiological literature generally emphasises undertreatment of late-life depression but hardly addresses iatrogenic damage due to overtreatment of depressed mood.</p>"
"<p>Most findings that argue for a discontinuity between depressed mood and a depressive disorder in later life provide only indirect evidence. Even though a depressed mood might be considered a geriatric syndrome on its own in older persons who are resilient to a depressive disorder, it may still lie on a continuum with depressive disorders in a subgroup of patients (see <a href=""#f1"" class=""usa-link"">Figure 1</a>). This review provides some evidence that clinical judgement might help to distinguish between the two types of depressed mood, but further research is needed to determine the extent to which this is feasible in clinical practice. In addition, the distinction between depressed mood and <em>normal</em> mood is arbitrary and probably dictated more by socio-cultural norms than by medical norms.</p>"
"<p>Furthermore, this review has focused primarily on the impact of physical functioning and biological ageing as driving factors underlying depressed mood. The model may also apply to people with neuroticism. Depressive disorders share less than half of their genetic variance with neuroticism [<a href=""#ref44"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref44"">44</a>], and people with only a unique genetic liability for neuroticism but not for a depressive disorder may suffer from low mood without being at increased risk for a depressive disorder.</p>"
<p>The discontinuity hypothesis of depression in later life has both clinical and research implications.</p>
"<p>First, the high prevalence of a depressed mood in later life requires treatment to improve sufferers’ well-being. Treatment algorithms for depressed mood are, however, not the same as for depressive disorders. It is unlikely that a depressed mood will progress into a depressive disorder in older people who are not vulnerable to developing a depressive disorder. This is particularly true for older people for whom the pathophysiology is driven by age-related risk factors (see <a href=""#f1"" class=""usa-link"">Figure 1</a>). <em>Watchful waiting</em> might be indicated and antidepressants contra-indicated to prevent iatrogenic damage. Furthermore, positive psychology might be preferred for targeting depressed mood [<a href=""#ref53"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref53"">53</a>], like life review, acceptance and commitment therapy, and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy.</p>"
"<p>Second, stratification of clinical trials is needed to empirically investigate many of the assumptions presented in this review. Clinical trials targeted at a broad range of subtypes of late-life depression require stratified randomisation according to diagnostic subtype. Clinical trials for people with milder forms of depression, who need support to improve their mood, should stratify randomisation according to long-standing vulnerability markers for depressive disorders.</p>"
"<p>Third, people with a depressed mood might be more reactive to external circumstances than those meeting the diagnostic criteria for a depressive disorder [<a href=""#ref2"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref2"">2</a>]. Assessing day-to-day variability in mood using experience sampling methods (ESM) may be particularly relevant for those who do not meet the criteria for a depressive disorder. ESM generally uses mobile technology to study what people do, feel and think during their daily lives by randomly asking them to self-report throughout the day. These data allow for close monitoring with high ecological validity to identify early warning signals of mood deterioration and to identify person-specific determinants of mood changes [<a href=""#ref85"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref85"">85–87</a>]. An ageist attitude often leads to exclusion of older persons from ESM studies, while this may only apply to older persons with (mild) cognitive impairment [<a href=""#ref88"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref88"">88–90</a>].</p>"
"<p>Fourth, the complex etiological heterogeneity of late-life depression warrants a geriatric approach. The traditional biological, psychological and social factors indicate patients’ vulnerability for a depressive disorder and their age-related risk factors for depressed mood. Together, they can be used to estimate the patient’s risk for progression to a depressive disorder (see <a href=""#f1"" class=""usa-link"">Figure 1</a>). Semi-structured diagnostic interviews for diagnosing depressive disorder and clinician-rated severity scales are mandatory in both clinical practice and high-quality research in late-life depression [<a href=""#ref91"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref91"">91</a>]. Semi-structured interviews are also able to take the periodicity of depressive disorder into account by assessing past and current episodes. Self-report depression scales could be added to allow differentiation between the detrimental health consequences of a depressive disorder and depressive symptoms as an epiphenomenon.</p>"
"<p>Fifth, differences between older and younger age groups should be empirically evaluated. Future studies should examine whether genetic risk factors for depression are moderated by age or differentially interact with environmental factors across the life span. Randomised controlled trials on treatment and prevention of depressive disorders should include participants with a broad age-span. Age-stratified randomisation with sufficient statistical power in all age groups is needed to examine differential effects between younger and older people. The same holds true for epidemiological and clinical cohort studies on depression. Epidemiological studies should examine the interaction between age-related risk factors for depressed mood and vulnerability for a depressive disorder. Because the prevalence of a determinant and the strength of its association with a depressive disorder may differ across the lifespan [<a href=""#ref92"" class=""usa-link"" aria-describedby=""ref92"">92</a>], studies are needed to refine age-specific prevention and treatment algorithms.</p>"
"<p>Late-life depression is an important topic that needs to be addressed using a coordinated and tailored approach to health and social care. This requires a proactive approach for monitoring and reviewing the mood of older adults, acknowledging that depressed mood and depressive disorders do not necessarily lie on the same continuum of severity. To prevent overtreatment, proper diagnostics conducted by well-trained physicians are needed instead of only self-report instruments and structured interviews. Considering late-life depression as a geriatric syndrome may bring the spotlight onto this problem and send a clear signal to geriatric experts that depression is highly heterogeneous and deserves a more personalised approach.</p>"
